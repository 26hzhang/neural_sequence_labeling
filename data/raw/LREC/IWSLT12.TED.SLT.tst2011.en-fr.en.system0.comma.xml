    <description>Daniel Tammet has linguistic, numerical and visual synesthesia -- meaning that his perception of words, numbers and colors are woven together into a new way of perceiving and understanding the world. The author of "Born on a Blue Day," Tammet shares his art and his passion for languages in this glimpse into his beautiful mind.</description>

    <title>Daniel Tammet: Different ways of knowing</title>
<seg id="1">  i'm as a font, or more precisely, a high-functioning autistic savant  </seg>
<seg id="2">  it's a rare condition  </seg>
<seg id="3">  and rarer still when accompanied, as in my case, by self-awareness and a mastery of language  </seg>
<seg id="4">  very often when i meet someone and they've learned is about me, there's a certain kind of awkwardness  </seg>
<seg id="5">  i can see it in their lives  </seg>
<seg id="6">  they want to ask me something  </seg>
<seg id="7">  and in the end, quite often, the urge stronger than they are and they blurted out, if i give you my date of birth, can it's an order of the week i was born on  </seg>
<seg id="8">  well they mention cube roots all asked me to recite a long number or long text  </seg>
<seg id="9">  i hope you'll forgive me, if i don't perform a kind of one-man savant show for you today  </seg>
<seg id="10">  i i'm going to talk instead about something far more interesting than these of first full cube roots, a little deeper and a lot closer, to my mind, and work  </seg>
<seg id="11">  i want to talk to you briefly about perception  </seg>
<seg id="12">  when he was my team that plays in the short story step would make his name, anton chekhov kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him, little details that other people seem to miss  </seg>
<seg id="13">  every time i read chekhov and his unique vision of human life, i'm reminded of why i too became a light  </seg>
<seg id="14">  in my books, i explore nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding  </seg>
<seg id="15">  here are three questions drawn from my work  </seg>
<seg id="16">  i love it and try to figure them out, and going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts they're going through your head and your heart as you look at them  </seg>
<seg id="17">  for example the calculation  </seg>
<seg id="18">  can you feel well and the number line the solution is likely to fall?  </seg>
<seg id="19">  well look at the four and work and the sounds  </seg>
<seg id="20">  can you get a sense of the range of meanings but it's pointing you towards?  </seg>
<seg id="21">  and in terms of the line of poetry, why does the poet use the word hare laugh and in love it?  </seg>
<seg id="22">  i'm asking you to do this because i believe that our personal perceptions, you see, like the heart of how we acquire knowledge  </seg>
<seg id="23">  aesthetic judgments, rather than abstract reasoning, guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know  </seg>
<seg id="24">  i'm an extreme example of this  </seg>
<seg id="25">  my worlds of words and numbers lair with color, emotion and personality  </seg>
<seg id="26">  as kwan said, it's a condition that scientists call soonest easier, when usual course talk between the fences  </seg>
<seg id="27">  here are the numbers one to twelve as i see them, every number with its own shape and character  </seg>
<seg id="28">  one is a flash of light light  </seg>
<seg id="29">  six is a tiny and very sad black hole  </seg>
<seg id="30">  the sketches i'm black and white it, but in my mind they have come to this  </seg>
<seg id="31">  three is going  </seg>
<seg id="32">  four is blue  </seg>
<seg id="33">  five is yellow  </seg>
<seg id="34">  i paint as well  </seg>
<seg id="35">  and here is one of my paintings  </seg>
<seg id="36">  it's a multiplication of two prime numbers  </seg>
<seg id="37">  three-dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape, the answer to the sum  </seg>
<seg id="38">  what about bigger numbers  </seg>
<seg id="39">  well you can't get much bigger than empowering, the mathematical constant  </seg>
<seg id="40">  it's an infinite number, literally goes on forever  </seg>
<seg id="41">  in this painting but i made of the first twenty decimals of pi, i take the covers and the emotions and the textures and i paula more together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape  </seg>
<seg id="42">  but it's not only numbers that i see in countries  </seg>
<seg id="43">  words too, for me, have colors and emotions and textures  </seg>
<seg id="44">  and this is an opening phrase from the novel lolita  </seg>
<seg id="45">  and nabokov was himself soon is static  </seg>
<seg id="46">  and you can see here how my perception of the sound l helps the alliteration to jump right out  </seg>
<seg id="47">  another example, a little bit more mathematical  </seg>
<seg id="48">  when i wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from the great gatsby  </seg>
<seg id="49">  there is a procession of syllables, wheat, one. prairies, two. lost swede towns, three, one, two, three  </seg>
<seg id="50">  and this effect is very pleasant on the mind, and it helps the sentence to feel like it  </seg>
<seg id="51">  let's go back to the questions i posed your moments ago  </seg>
<seg id="52">  sixty four multiplied by seventy five  </seg>
<seg id="53">  it so if you played chess, your know that sixty four is a square number, and that's why just forwards, eight by eight, have sixty four squares  </seg>
<seg id="54">  so that gives us a form that we can picture, we can perceive  </seg>
<seg id="55">  about seventy five  </seg>
<seg id="56">  well it's a hundred, we think of a hundred as of being a like a square, seventy five would look like this  </seg>
<seg id="57">  so what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind, something like this  </seg>
<seg id="58">  sixty four become sixty four hundred  </seg>
<seg id="59">  and in the light hand corner, you don't have to calculate anything  </seg>
<seg id="60">  full across, four up and down, at sixteen  </seg>
<seg id="61">  so what the sum is actually asking you to do is sixteen, sixteen, sixteen  </seg>
<seg id="62">  that's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math, some show  </seg>
<seg id="63">  it's sixteen, sixteen, sixteen, forty eight, forty eight hundred, four thousand eight hundred, the answer to the sum  </seg>
<seg id="64">  easy when you know how  </seg>
<seg id="65">  the second question was an icelandic word  </seg>
<seg id="66">  i'm assuming are not many people here who speak icelandic  </seg>
<seg id="67">  so let me now over choices down to two  </seg>
<seg id="68">  is it a happy word was sad word?  </seg>
<seg id="69">  what you say?  </seg>
<seg id="70">  market  </seg>
<seg id="71">  some people say it's happy  </seg>
<seg id="72">  most people, a majority of people say sad  </seg>
<seg id="73">  and it actually means out  </seg>
<seg id="74">  why do, statistically, a majority of people say that a word is sad, in this case, heavy in other cases?  </seg>
<seg id="75">  in my theory language evolves in such a way that sounds match, correspond with the subjective, with the personal intuitive experience of the listener  </seg>
<seg id="76">  let's have a look at the the third question  </seg>
<seg id="77">  it's a line from a poem by john keeps  </seg>
<seg id="78">  words, like numbers, express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world  </seg>
<seg id="79">  it stands to reason that we, existing in this well it, should be in the course of our lives absorb intuitively those relationships  </seg>
<seg id="80">  some poets, like other artists, play with those intuitive understandings  </seg>
<seg id="81">  in the case of hare, it's an ambiguous sound in english  </seg>
<seg id="82">  you can also mean the five a quote from ahead  </seg>
<seg id="83">  and if we think of that, we put the picture up, the five was represent vulnerability  </seg>
<seg id="84">  there you would to the slightest movement or motion or emotion  </seg>
<seg id="85">  so what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability intention  </seg>
<seg id="86">  the hare itself the animal, not a cat, litter dog, hair, why hair?  </seg>
<seg id="87">  because think of the picture, not a word, the picture  </seg>
<seg id="88">  the overlong ears, the over large feet, helps us to picture, to feel intuitively, what it means to limp and to tremble  </seg>
<seg id="89">  so in these few minutes, i hope i've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things, and to show you that words can have colors and emotions, numbers, shapes and personalities  </seg>
<seg id="90">  the world is richer, vaster than it too often seems to be  </seg>
<seg id="91">  i hope that i've given you desire to learn to see the world with new eyes  </seg>
<seg id="92">  thank you  </seg>

    <title>Shea Hembrey: How I became 100 artists</title>
<seg id="1">  i'm going to play artist with a bit of an unexpected background  </seg>
<seg id="2">  i was in my twenties before i ever which an art museum  </seg>
<seg id="3">  i grew up in the middle of nowhere on a dirt road in rural arkansas, an hour from the nearest movie theater  </seg>
<seg id="4">  and i think it was a great place to grow up as an artist, because i grew up around quirky, colorful characters who are great at making with their hands  </seg>
<seg id="5">  and my childhood is more hick than i could ever possibly relate to you, and also a more intellectual than you would ever expect  </seg>
<seg id="6">  for instance, me and my sister, we were little, we would compete to see who could eat the most squirrel brains  </seg>
<seg id="7">  but it on the other side of that though, we are we are big readers in our house  </seg>
<seg id="8">  and if the TV was on we're watching a documentary  </seg>
<seg id="9">  and my dad is the most voracious reader i know  </seg>
<seg id="10">  you can read a novel or two a day  </seg>
<seg id="11">  but when i was little, i remember, he would kill flies in our house with my BB gun  </seg>
<seg id="12">  and what was so amazing to me about that, what he would be in his recliner, would holler for me to fetch that BB gun, and i'd go get it  </seg>
<seg id="13">  and what was amazing to me, was a bullet was pretty kickass, he was killing a fly in the house with a gun, but what was so amazing to me was that he knew just enough how pump  </seg>
<seg id="14">  and he could shoot it for you know like two rooms away and not damage what was on, because he knew how to pump it just enough to kill the fly and not damage what it was landed on  </seg>
<seg id="15">  so i should talk about or  </seg>
<seg id="16">  but that will be here all day with my childhood stories  </seg>
<seg id="17">  i love contemporary art, but i'm also doing really frustrated with the contemporary art world and the contemporary art scene  </seg>
<seg id="18">  a few years ago, i spent months in europe to see the major international art exhibitions that no have the pulse of what is supposed to be going on in the art world  </seg>
<seg id="19">  and i was struck by going to so many, one after the other, kind of with some clarity of what it was that i was longing for  </seg>
<seg id="20">  i mean i'm going for several things i wasn't getting, or not getting enough love  </seg>
<seg id="21">  but to the main things, one of that, i was longing for more work that was appealing to a broad public, that was accessible  </seg>
<seg id="22">  and the second thing that i was going for was more exquisite craftsmanship and technique  </seg>
<seg id="23">  so i i started thinking and listing what all it was that i thought would make a perfect biennial  </seg>
<seg id="24">  so i decided, i'm going to start my own biennial  </seg>
<seg id="25">  i'm going to organize and direct it and get it going in the world  </seg>
<seg id="26">  so i thought, okay, i have to have some criteria of how to choose work  </seg>
<seg id="27">  so amongst all the country had, this kind of two main things  </seg>
<seg id="28">  one of them, i call my mama's test  </seg>
<seg id="29">  and what that is is i imagine explaining a work of art to my grandmother in five minutes  </seg>
<seg id="30">  and if i can explain it five minutes, then it's it's too obtuse or are as a trick and it has been refined enough yet  </seg>
<seg id="31">  it needs to be worked on intelligence speak fluently  </seg>
<seg id="32">  and then my other second set of rules, i hate to say rules because it's are caught, my criteria would be the three ages, which is a head, heart and hands  </seg>
<seg id="33">  and great art would have hit, it would have interesting intellectual ideas and concepts  </seg>
<seg id="34">  it would have heart in that it would have passionate heart and soul  </seg>
<seg id="35">  and it would have hand in that it would be greatly crafted  </seg>
<seg id="36">  so i started thinking about poker hand this biennial, how i'm going to show how my going to travel the world and find these artists  </seg>
<seg id="37">  and then i realized one day, that there's an easier solution to this  </seg>
<seg id="38">  i'm just going to make the whole thing myself  </seg>
<seg id="39">  and so this is what i did  </seg>
<seg id="40">  i i i thought, okay biennial needs artists  </seg>
<seg id="41">  number did in international biennial, i need artists from all around the world  </seg>
<seg id="42">  so what i did was i invented a hundred artists from around the world  </seg>
<seg id="43">  i figured out their bios, their passions in life and their art styles, and i started making their work  </seg>
<seg id="44">  and so i thought well, this is kind of project that i did my whole life doing  </seg>
<seg id="45">  so i decided, i'm going to make this a real biennial  </seg>
<seg id="46">  it's only two years of studio work  </seg>
<seg id="47">  and i'm going to create this in two years  </seg>
<seg id="48">  in i have  </seg>
<seg id="49">  so i i should i should start to talk about these guys  </seg>
<seg id="50">  well the range is it's quite a bit  </seg>
<seg id="51">  and i'm such a technician, so i love this project, getting to play with all the techniques  </seg>
<seg id="52">  so for example, in realist paintings, ranges from like this, which is kind of old masters style, to really realistic still-life, to this type of painting where i'm painting with a single hair  </seg>
<seg id="53">  and then at the other end, there's performance and short sounds and endorsed installations like this indoor installations and this one, and other installations like this one and this one  </seg>
<seg id="54">  a nice image, i'm making all these things  </seg>
<seg id="55">  this is isn't publish opt  </seg>
<seg id="56">  i'm like under the river with those fish  </seg>
<seg id="57">  so now let me introduce some of my fictional artists do you  </seg>
<seg id="58">  this is now reynolds  </seg>
<seg id="59">  now i was interested in agricultural processes, and her work is based in these practices  </seg>
<seg id="60">  this piece, which is called flipped earth, she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground  </seg>
<seg id="61">  and by taking giant mirrors, in here she's taking giant mirrors and then pulling them into the dirt  </seg>
<seg id="62">  and the great this is twenty two feet long  </seg>
<seg id="63">  what i loved about her work is, when i walk around it in and look and look down into the sky, you know looking down to watch the sky, and it folded in a new way  </seg>
<seg id="64">  and probably the best part of this piece is at dusk and dawn when mike that the twilight which is falling on the ground stark, but this the light above bright above  </seg>
<seg id="65">  and so you're standing there anything else to start, that there's this portal that you want to jump in  </seg>
<seg id="66">  and this piece was great. this is in my parents' backyard in arkansas  </seg>
<seg id="67">  and i love to dig a hole  </seg>
<seg id="68">  so this piece was great fine, has it was two days of digging and softer  </seg>
<seg id="69">  the next artist is scale over three, and she's interested enough to morality and transience  </seg>
<seg id="70">  and in her most recent project, it's called weather i made  </seg>
<seg id="71">  and she's making weather on her body's scale  </seg>
<seg id="72">  and this piece is prof  </seg>
<seg id="73">  in what she did was human and on a cold, dry night in breed back and forth on the long island to leave, to leave her life's mark, the marker of progress  </seg>
<seg id="74">  and so this is five foot, five inches of frost that she left behind  </seg>
<seg id="75">  the sun rises, and it melts away  </seg>
<seg id="76">  and that that was played by my mum  </seg>
<seg id="77">  so the next artist, this is a group of japanese artists, a collective of japanese artists, in their own and in tokyo  </seg>
<seg id="78">  and they were interested in developing a new, alternative art space  </seg>
<seg id="79">  and they needed funding for it, so they decided to come up with some interesting fundraising projects  </seg>
<seg id="80">  one of these is scratch-off masterpieces  </seg>
<seg id="81">  and so so what they're doing, each of these artists on a nine by seven inch card, which they sell for ten bucks, they drew original works of art  </seg>
<seg id="82">  and you buy one, and maybe you get a real peace and maybe not  </seg>
<seg id="83">  well this is part of this has sparked a craze in japan, because everyone's wanting a masterpiece  </seg>
<seg id="84">  and the ones that are most sought after on winter only barely scratched off  </seg>
<seg id="85">  and all these works, in some ways, talk about luck or fate or chance  </seg>
<seg id="86">  those first two are tortured to make a jackpot winners years before and after their win  </seg>
<seg id="87">  and in this one it's called a drawing the short stick  </seg>
<seg id="88">  i love this piece because i have a little cousin at home we introduced me, which i think it's such a great introduction, to friend one day as, this is my cousin j  </seg>
<seg id="89">  he draws sticks real the  </seg>
<seg id="90">  which is one of the best coverage ever  </seg>
<seg id="91">  this artist as gusts wind miller, and he's doing a project, large project, called art for the peoples  </seg>
<seg id="92">  and within this project, is doing a smaller project called artists in residence  </seg>
<seg id="93">  and what he does is, he spends a week at a time with the family  </seg>
<seg id="94">  any these shows up on the shows up on their porch, their doorstep, with was a toothbrush and pajamas, and he's ready to spend a week with them  </seg>
<seg id="95">  and using only what's present, he goes in and makes a little abode studio to work out of  </seg>
<seg id="96">  on an expense that week talking to the family about what they think great art is  </seg>
<seg id="97">  yes all these discussions with their family  </seg>
<seg id="98">  any digs through everything they have, and he finds materials to make war  </seg>
<seg id="99">  and he makes a work that answers what they think great art is  </seg>
<seg id="100">  for this family, he made this still-life painting  </seg>
<seg id="101">  and whatever he makes somehow references nesting in and space and personal property  </seg>
<seg id="102">  this next project, is this is by a walking parents they go, and he's interested in, people believes that art is everywhere waiting, that it just needs a little bit of a push to happen  </seg>
<seg id="103">  and he provides this push by harnessing natural forces, like in this series we used rain to make paintings  </seg>
<seg id="104">  this project is called love nests  </seg>
<seg id="105">  what he did was to get wild birds to make is are born  </seg>
<seg id="106">  so he put the material in places where the birds were in the collective men, they crafted his nests form  </seg>
<seg id="107">  and this one's called love locksmiths  </seg>
<seg id="108">  this one's called mixtape love song nest  </seg>
<seg id="109">  and this one's called lovemaking nest  </seg>
<seg id="110">  next is a belief later  </seg>
<seg id="111">  sylvia's interested in art training  </seg>
<seg id="112">  she's very serious swiss artist  </seg>
<seg id="113">  and she was thinking about her friends and family who are working in my car sweden places in developing countries, and she was thinking, what can i make that would be of value to them, in case you know something bad happens and they have to buy their way across the border or pay off a gunman  </seg>
<seg id="114">  and so she came up with creating these pocket-sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them  </seg>
<seg id="115">  and you would carry this around with you, and if everything with the health, and you could make payments and by your life  </seg>
<seg id="116">  so this life price is for an irrigation non-profit director  </seg>
<seg id="117">  so hopefully what happens is you never use it, and it's it's an airline they passed down  </seg>
<seg id="118">  and she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments, or they could be like these which are leaves that can be payments  </seg>
<seg id="119">  until they're valuable. this is precious metals and gemstones  </seg>
<seg id="120">  and this one had to get broken up  </seg>
<seg id="121">  he had to break off a piece to get out of egypt recently  </seg>
<seg id="122">  this is my duo, michael abernathy and bud holland  </seg>
<seg id="123">  and they're interested in creating culture, just tradition  </seg>
<seg id="124">  so what they do is they move into an area and try to establish a new tradition and a small geographic area  </seg>
<seg id="125">  so this is in eastern tennessee, and what they decided was that you know we need a positive tradition that goes with death  </seg>
<seg id="126">  so they came up with big gigs  </seg>
<seg id="127">  and it did did, i did you is where, for a milestone anniversary or birthday, you are and you get all your friends and family together and you dance on where you're going to be buried  </seg>
<seg id="128">  and we we got a lot of it is a millimeter thick is this  </seg>
<seg id="129">  i talked my family into doing this, all that and what i was doing  </seg>
<seg id="130">  like dress if you know, we're going to go do some work  </seg>
<seg id="131">  and so we got to the graveyard and made this, which was whole areas of, the attention that we got  </seg>
<seg id="132">  so what happens is you dance on the grave  </seg>
<seg id="133">  and then after you've done your dance, everyone toast you and tells you how great you are  </seg>
<seg id="134">  new beans essence have a funeral they to be present for  </seg>
<seg id="135">  that's my mum and dad  </seg>
<seg id="136">  this is my jason birdsong  </seg>
<seg id="137">  he is interested in how we see as an animal, how we are interested in mimicry and camouflage  </seg>
<seg id="138">  you know we look down a dark alley or jungle path, trying to make out a face or a preacher  </seg>
<seg id="139">  we said that natural way of seeing  </seg>
<seg id="140">  and he plays with this idea  </seg>
<seg id="141">  and and this piece, schools on actually leave  </seg>
<seg id="142">  there are butterfly specimens have a natural camouflage  </seg>
<seg id="143">  so he pairs these up  </seg>
<seg id="144">  here's another  </seg>
<seg id="145">  solar actually all real brick a butterfly specimens  </seg>
<seg id="146">  and he pairs these out with paintings  </seg>
<seg id="147">  like this is a painting of a stake in a box  </seg>
<seg id="148">  so you you open the box and you think, well, there's a there's a snake in there  </seg>
<seg id="149">  but it's actually a painting  </seg>
<seg id="150">  so he makes these interesting conversations about realism in mimicry in our drive to be fooled by great camouflage  </seg>
<seg id="151">  the next artist is hazel clausen  </seg>
<seg id="152">  it's a parsons an anthropologist who took a sabbatical and decided, you know, i would learn a lot about culture if i created a culture that doesn't exist from scratch  </seg>
<seg id="153">  so that's what she did  </seg>
<seg id="154">  she created the swiss people mainly you you lights, and they have this distinctive yodeling song that that they use that you look for  </seg>
<seg id="155">  and also they reference how do you like, everything they say is is falling because of the written by forbidden fruit  </seg>
<seg id="156">  and that's the symbol of on the road their culture  </seg>
<seg id="157">  and this is from a documentary called sexual practices in populations control among the lights  </seg>
<seg id="158">  this is this is a typical angora embroidery for them  </seg>
<seg id="159">  this is one of the founders gert schaeffer  </seg>

    <description>At TED's Full Spectrum Auditions, comedian Joshua Walters, who's bipolar, walks the line between mental illness and mental "skillness." In this funny, thought-provoking talk, he asks: What's the right balance between medicating craziness away and riding the manic edge of creativity and drive?</description>

    <title>Joshua Walters: On being just crazy enough</title>
<seg id="1">  my name is joshua walters  </seg>
<seg id="2">  i'm a performer  </seg>
<seg id="3">  in the end but the beginning to the end of the world and the and the end of the day i was only performer, i'm also diagnosed bipolar  </seg>
<seg id="4">  reframe that as a positive, because the crazier i get onstage, the more entertaining i become  </seg>
<seg id="5">  when i was sixteen in san francisco, have my breakthrough manic episode in which i thought i was jesus christ  </seg>
<seg id="6">  maybe you thought that was a no scary, but actually there's no matter drugs you can take the can get you as high as if you think you're jesus christ  </seg>
<seg id="7">  i was sent to a place, psych ward and in the psych ward, everyone is doing their own one-man show  </seg>
<seg id="8">  there's an audience like this to justify their rehearsal time  </seg>
<seg id="9">  the just practising  </seg>
<seg id="10">  one day they'll get here  </seg>
<seg id="11">  now when i got out, i was diagnosed and i was given medications by a psychiatrist  </seg>
<seg id="12">  moving in kenya as well we give you some, work well we give you some merger this summer zyprexa  </seg>
<seg id="13">  thank you  </seg>
<seg id="14">  at least that's what it says in my pen  </seg>
<seg id="15">  some of you are in the field i can see  </seg>
<seg id="16">  i can feel your noise  </seg>
<seg id="17">  the first half of high school was the struggle of the manic episode, in the second half was the over medications of these drugs, when i was sleeping through high school  </seg>
<seg id="18">  the second half was just one big nap, pretty much, in class  </seg>
<seg id="19">  when i got out i had a choice  </seg>
<seg id="20">  i could either deny my mental illness or embrace my mental stillness  </seg>
<seg id="21">  there's a movement going on right now to reframe mental illness as a positive, at least the hype manic edge part of it  </seg>
<seg id="22">  now if you don't know what hype mania is, it's like an engine that's out of control, maybe a ferrari engine with no breaks  </seg>
<seg id="23">  many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience, have that creative edge, if you know what i'm talking about  </seg>
<seg id="24">  you driven to do something that everyone has told you is impossible  </seg>
<seg id="25">  is a book, john gardner  </seg>
<seg id="26">  john gartner wrote this book called the hype manic edge in which christopher columbus and ted turner and steve jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete  </seg>
<seg id="27">  a different book was written not too long ago in the mid nineties called a called touch with fire by kay redfield jamison, in which it was that that in a creative sense, in which motes art and they told that and then go all had this manic depression that they were suffering with  </seg>
<seg id="28">  some them committed suicide  </seg>
<seg id="29">  so it wasn't all the good side of the illness  </seg>
<seg id="30">  now recently there's been development in this field  </seg>
<seg id="31">  and there was a article written in the new york times, september two thousand ten, the stated, it just manic enough  </seg>
<seg id="32">  just be manic enough in which investors we're looking for entrepreneurs or worse they had this kind of spectrum, you know what i'm talking about not maybe full bipolar, but they're in the bipolar spectrum, when one side, maybe you think you're jesus, and on the other side maybe they just make you a lot of money  </seg>
<seg id="33">  your call. your car  </seg>
<seg id="34">  everyone's somewhere in the middle  </seg>
<seg id="35">  everyone's somewhere in the middle  </seg>
<seg id="36">  so maybe, you know, there's no such thing as crazy, and being diagnosed with a mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy  </seg>
<seg id="37">  maybe it just means you're more sensitive to what most people can't see or feel  </seg>
<seg id="38">  maybe no one's really crazy  </seg>
<seg id="39">  everyone is just a little bit mad  </seg>
<seg id="40">  how much depends on where you fall in the spectrum  </seg>
<seg id="41">  how much depends on how lucky you are  </seg>
<seg id="42">  thank you  </seg>

    <description>When Dave deBronkart learned he had a rare and terminal cancer, he turned to a group of fellow patients online -- and found the medical treatment that saved his life. Now he calls on all patients to talk with one another, know their own health data, and make health care better one e-Patient at a time.</description>

    <title>Dave deBronkart: Meet e-Patient Dave</title>
<seg id="1">  it's amazing thing that we're here to talk about the year of patients rising  </seg>
<seg id="2">  you heard stories earlier today about patients who are taking control of their cases, patients who are saying, you know what, i know what the odds are, but i'm going to go look for more information  </seg>
<seg id="3">  i'm going to define what the terms of my success are  </seg>
<seg id="4">  i'm gonna be sharing with you how four years ago i almost died, found out i was, in fact, already almost dead  </seg>
<seg id="5">  and what i been found out about what's called the e patient movement, i'll explain what that term means  </seg>
<seg id="6">  i have been blogging under the name patient dave, and when i discovered this, i just renamed myself he patient days  </seg>
<seg id="7">  regarding the word patient, when i first started a few years ago getting involved in health care and attending meetings as just a casual observer, i noticed that people would talk about patients as if it was somebody who's not in the room here, somebody out there  </seg>
<seg id="8">  some of our talks today, we still act like that  </seg>
<seg id="9">  but i'm here to tell you, patient is not a third-person word  </seg>
<seg id="10">  you, yourself, will find yourself in a hospital bed, or your mother, your child, their heads nodding, people who say, yes, i know exactly what you mean  </seg>
<seg id="11">  so when you win you hear what i'm going to talk about here today, first of all, i want to say that i'm here on behalf of all the patients that i've ever met, all the ones i haven't met  </seg>
<seg id="12">  this is about letting patients play a more active role in helping health care, in fixing health care  </seg>
<seg id="13">  one of the senior doctors in my hospital, charlie saffron, and his colleague, warner slack, have been saying for decades that the most underutilized resource in all of health care is the patient  </seg>
<seg id="14">  they've been saying that since the nineteen seventies  </seg>
<seg id="15">  that would step back in history  </seg>
<seg id="16">  this is from july, nineteen sixty nine  </seg>
<seg id="17">  i was a freshman in college, and this was when we first landed on the moon  </seg>
<seg id="18">  it was the first time we've ever seen from another surface, that's the place where you and i are right now, where we live  </seg>
<seg id="19">  the world was changing  </seg>
<seg id="20">  there is about to change in ways that nobody could foresee  </seg>
<seg id="21">  a few weeks later, woodstock happened  </seg>
<seg id="22">  three days of fun and music  </seg>
<seg id="23">  here, just for historical authenticity, is a picture of me in that year  </seg>
<seg id="24">  i have bite the other way, the hair blue eyes, it was really something  </seg>
<seg id="25">  that fall of nineteen sixty nine, the whole earth catalog came out  </seg>
<seg id="26">  it was a hippie journal of self-sufficiency  </seg>
<seg id="27">  we think of hippies as being just hedonists, but there's a very strong component, i was in that movement, a very strong component of being responsible for yourself  </seg>
<seg id="28">  this book's title's subtitle is, access to tools  </seg>
<seg id="29">  and he talked about how to build your own house, how to grow your own food, all kinds of things  </seg>
<seg id="30">  in the nineteen eighties, this young doctor, tom ferguson, was the medical editor of the whole earth catalog  </seg>
<seg id="31">  and he saw that the great majority of what we do in medicine health care is taking care of ourselves  </seg>
<seg id="32">  in fact, he said was seventy to eighty percent of our how we actually take care of our bodies  </seg>
<seg id="33">  well try he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease, the key thing that holds us back is access to information  </seg>
<seg id="34">  and when the web came along that changed everything, because not only could we find information, we could find other people like ourselves who could gather, who could bring us information  </seg>
<seg id="35">  and he coined this term the patients, equipped, engaged, empowered, enabled  </seg>
<seg id="36">  obviously at this stage of life, he was in a somewhat more dignified form that he was back there  </seg>
<seg id="37">  now i was an engaged patient long before i ever heard of the term  </seg>
<seg id="38">  in two thousand six, i went to my doctor for regular physical, and i said i have a sore shoulder  </seg>
<seg id="39">  well, i got an x-ray, and the next morning, you may have noticed, those of you who have had been through medical crisis will understand this  </seg>
<seg id="40">  this morning, some of the speakers named the date when they found out about their condition  </seg>
<seg id="41">  for me, it was nine AM on january thirty, two thousand seven  </seg>
<seg id="42">  i was at the office. my desk was clean. out of the blue partition carpet on the walls  </seg>
<seg id="43">  the phone rang and it was my doctor  </seg>
<seg id="44">  he said that he said, dave, i called up the x-ray image on the screen the computer at home  </seg>
<seg id="45">  he said, his shoulders going to be fine, but they, there's something in your life  </seg>
<seg id="46">  if you look in that red oval, that shadow was not supposed to be there  </seg>
<seg id="47">  to make a long story short, they said, so you need me to get back in there  </seg>
<seg id="48">  he said, you really need to do a CT scan of your trust  </seg>
<seg id="49">  the lights in parting i said, is there anything i should do  </seg>
<seg id="50">  we said, i think about this one  </seg>
<seg id="51">  this is the advice of doctor gives you  </seg>
<seg id="52">  just go home and have a glass of wine with your wife  </seg>
<seg id="53">  i went in for the cat scan, and turns out there were five of these things in both my lungs  </seg>
<seg id="54">  so at that point we knew that it was cancer  </seg>
<seg id="55">  we know wasn't lung cancer  </seg>
<seg id="56">  that meant it was met has the size from somewhere  </seg>
<seg id="57">  the question was where from?  </seg>
<seg id="58">  so i went in for an ultrasound  </seg>
<seg id="59">  i got to do what many women have, jelly on the belly in the indices  </seg>
<seg id="60">  my wife came with me  </seg>
<seg id="61">  she's a veterinarian, she's seen lots of ultrasounds  </seg>
<seg id="62">  i mean, she knows another dog  </seg>
<seg id="63">  but what we saw, this is an MRI image  </seg>
<seg id="64">  this is much sharper than an ultrasound would be  </seg>
<seg id="65">  what we saw in that to me was that big blob there  </seg>
<seg id="66">  and there are actually two of these  </seg>
<seg id="67">  one was growing out the front of it already erupted, in latched onto the ball  </seg>
<seg id="68">  one was growing out the back, and it attached to the soulless muscle, which is a big muscle in the back that i'd never heard of, it all of a sudden i cared about it  </seg>
<seg id="69">  i went home  </seg>
<seg id="70">  now i've been googling, i've been online since nineteen eighty nine and compuserve  </seg>
<seg id="71">  i went home, and i know you can't read the details here. that's not important  </seg>
<seg id="72">  my point is i went to a respected medical website, where in the, because i know how to filter out junk  </seg>
<seg id="73">  right i also found my wife online  </seg>
<seg id="74">  before i met her, i went through some suboptimal search results  </seg>
<seg id="75">  so i did what i looked for quality information  </seg>
<seg id="76">  there's so much about trust, what sources of information can we trust?  </seg>
<seg id="77">  where does my body end and an invader start?  </seg>
<seg id="78">  you know cancer, tomas, something you grow out of your own tissue  </seg>
<seg id="79">  how does that happen?  </seg>
<seg id="80">  where metal medical ability end and start?  </seg>
<seg id="81">  well, so what i read on whether it be, the prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer  </seg>
<seg id="82">  almost all patients are incurable  </seg>
<seg id="83">  i've been online long enough to know if i don't like the first results i get, to go look for more  </seg>
<seg id="84">  and what i found was on other websites, even by the third page of google results, outlook is bleak, prognosis is grim  </seg>
<seg id="85">  and i'm thinking, what the heck  </seg>
<seg id="86">  i didn't feel sick at all  </seg>
<seg id="87">  i mean, i've been getting tired in the evening, but i was fifty six years old  </seg>
<seg id="88">  i was slowly losing weight, but for me, that was what the doctor told me that  </seg>
<seg id="89">  it was it was really something  </seg>
<seg id="90">  this is the diagram of stage four kidney cancer from the drug they eventually got  </seg>
<seg id="91">  i totally by coincidence, there's that thing in my life  </seg>
<seg id="92">  in the left femur, the left thigh bone, there's another one  </seg>
<seg id="93">  i have one. my leg eventually snapped  </seg>
<seg id="94">  i think that landed on it, and it broke  </seg>
<seg id="95">  there's one in the skull, and then just for good measure, i had these other tumors, including, by the time i treatment started, one was growing out of my tongue  </seg>
<seg id="96">  the kidney cancer growing out of my tongue  </seg>
<seg id="97">  and what i read was that my median survival was twenty four weeks  </seg>
<seg id="98">  this is bad  </seg>
<seg id="99">  i was facing the grain  </seg>
<seg id="100">  i thought, that's my mother's face can look like on the day of my funeral  </seg>
<seg id="101">  i have to sit down with my daughter and say, not be here's the situation  </seg>
<seg id="102">  her boyfriend was weather  </seg>
<seg id="103">  i said, i don't want you guys to get married prematurely just so you can do it while dad's still alive  </seg>
<seg id="104">  so really serious  </seg>
<seg id="105">  this if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help, to think about this  </seg>
<seg id="106">  well, my doctor prescribed the patient community, a cordon or, a network of cancer patients, of all amazing things  </seg>
<seg id="107">  very quickly they told me, kidney cancer is an uncommon disease  </seg>
<seg id="108">  get yourself to a specialist centre  </seg>
<seg id="109">  there is no cure, but there's something that sometimes works, it usually doesn't, called high dosage into look good  </seg>
<seg id="110">  most hospitals don't offer it, so they won't even tell you it exists  </seg>
<seg id="111">  and don't let them give you anything else first  </seg>
<seg id="112">  by the way, here are four doctors in your part of the united states who offer it and their phone numbers  </seg>
<seg id="113">  how amazing is that  </seg>
<seg id="114">  here's the thing  </seg>
<seg id="115">  here we are, four years later, you can find a website that gives patients that information  </seg>
<seg id="116">  government-approved, american cancer society, but patients know what patients want to now  </seg>
<seg id="117">  it's the power of patient networks  </seg>
<seg id="118">  this amazing substance, again i i mentioned, where does my body end?  </seg>
<seg id="119">  my oncologist and i talk a lot these days, because they try to keep my talks technically accurate  </seg>
<seg id="120">  he said, you know, the immune system is good at detecting invaders, now that bacteria coming from outside, but when it's your own tissue that you've grown, it's a whole different effect  </seg>
<seg id="121">  and i went through a mental exercise actually, there's i started a patient a support community of my own on a website, and one of my friends, were my relatives actually, said, look, dave, who through this thing?  </seg>
<seg id="122">  how are you going to set yourself up as mentally attacking yourself?  </seg>
<seg id="123">  so we we went into it  </seg>
<seg id="124">  the story of how all that happens is in the book  </seg>
<seg id="125">  anyway, this is the way the numbers unfolded  </seg>
<seg id="126">  the being me, i put the numbers from my hospital's website from my tumor sizes into a spreadsheet  </seg>
<seg id="127">  i don't worry about the numbers  </seg>
<seg id="128">  see, that's the immune system  </seg>
<seg id="129">  amazing thing, goes to yellow lines are where i got the two doses of into and two months apart  </seg>
<seg id="130">  and look at how the tumor sizes plummeted in between  </seg>
<seg id="131">  just incredible  </seg>
<seg id="132">  who knows what we'll be able to do when we learn to make more use of  </seg>
<seg id="133">  and the punch line is that a year and a half later, i was there when this magnificent young woman, my daughter, got married  </seg>
<seg id="134">  even when she came down those steps, and it was just her and me for that moment, i was so glad that you didn't have to say to her mother, i wish that i could have been here  </seg>
<seg id="135">  and this is what we're doing when we make health care better  </seg>
<seg id="136">  now i want to talk briefly about a couple of other patients who are doing everything in their power to improve health care  </seg>
<seg id="137">  this is regina holliday, a painter in washington DC, whose husband died of kidney cancer year after my disease  </seg>
<seg id="138">  she's painting here a mural of his horrible final weeks in the hospital  </seg>
<seg id="139">  one of the things that she discovered was that her husband's medical record in this paper folder was just disorganized  </seg>
<seg id="140">  and she thought, you know, if i have a nutrition facts label on the side of a cereal box, why can't there be something that simple telling every new nurse who comes on duty, every new doctor, the basics about my husband's condition?  </seg>
<seg id="141">  so she painted this medical facts mural of with the nutrition label, the something like that, and the diagram of him  </seg>
<seg id="142">  she that, last year, painted this diagram  </seg>
<seg id="143">  she studied health care like me  </seg>
<seg id="144">  she came to realize that there were a lot of people who'd written patient advocate books that you just don't hear about it medical conferences  </seg>
<seg id="145">  patients are such an underutilized resource  </seg>
<seg id="146">  well as it said my introduction, i've gotten somewhat known for saying that patients should have access to their data  </seg>
<seg id="147">  and i actually said at one conference a couple years ago, give me my damn data, because you people can be trusted to keep it clean  </seg>
<seg id="148">  and here she has our damned data, it's upon, which is starting to break out, starting to break through, the water symbolizes our data  </seg>
<seg id="149">  and in fact, i want to do a little something improvisational for you here  </seg>
<seg id="150">  there's a guy on twitter that i know, my health IT guy outside boston, and he wrote that he patient rap  </seg>
<seg id="151">  and it goes like this  </seg>
<seg id="152">  the way my damn data. i want to be in the patient just like they. do me my damn data. because it's not to say that i couldn't go any further  </seg>
<seg id="153">  well thank you. that's up the timing  </seg>
<seg id="154">  i think about the possibility, why is it that i phones and i had to advance far faster than the health tools that are available to you to help take carrier family?  </seg>
<seg id="155">  here's a website, visible body that come, that i stumbled across  </seg>
<seg id="156">  my thought, you know, i wonder what my so it's muscle is?  </seg>
<seg id="157">  so you can click on things and remove it  </seg>
<seg id="158">  and i saw, a heart, that's the kidney in the source muscle  </seg>
<seg id="159">  i was rotating it in three d and saying, i understand now  </seg>
<seg id="160">  and then i realized it reminded me of google earth, where you can fly to any dress  </seg>
<seg id="161">  and i thought, why not take this and connected to my digital scan data and have google earth from my body?  </seg>
<seg id="162">  what did will come out with this year?  </seg>
<seg id="163">  now there's google body browser  </seg>
<seg id="164">  but we see, that it's still generic  </seg>
<seg id="165">  it's not my data  </seg>
<seg id="166">  but if we can get that they'd have out from behind the dam so software innovators can pounce on it, the way software innovators like to do, who knows what we'll be able to come up with  </seg>
<seg id="167">  one final story, this is kelly young, a rheumatoid arthritis patient from florida  </seg>
<seg id="168">  this is a live story unfolding just in the last few weeks  </seg>
<seg id="169">  our eight patients, as they call themselves, heard her bloggers are a warrior, have a big problem because forty percent of them have no visible symptoms  </seg>
<seg id="170">  and that makes it is really hard to tell how the disease is going  </seg>
<seg id="171">  in some doctors think, yeah right, you really in pain  </seg>
<seg id="172">  well she found, through her online research, in nuclear bone scan that's usually used for cancer, but it can also reveal inflammation  </seg>
<seg id="173">  and she saw that if it's a if there is no inflammation and understand a uniform gray  </seg>
<seg id="174">  so he took it  </seg>
<seg id="175">  and the radiologist report said, no cancer found  </seg>
<seg id="176">  let's not ready response to do with it  </seg>
<seg id="177">  so she had it read again, she wanted to have it read again, and her doctor fired her  </seg>
<seg id="178">  she pulled up the CD  </seg>
<seg id="179">  he said, i if you don't want to follow mice instructions, go away  </seg>

    <description>Bill Ford is a car guy -- his great-grandfather was Henry Ford, and he grew up inside the massive Ford Motor Co. So when he worries about cars' impact on the environment, and about our growing global gridlock problem, it's worth a listen. His vision for the future of mobility includes "smart roads," even smarter public transport and going green like never before.</description>

    <title>Bill Ford: A future beyond traffic gridlock</title>
<seg id="1">  by birth and by choice, i've been involved with the auto industry my entire life, and for the past thirty years, i've worked at ford motor company  </seg>
<seg id="2">  it for most of those years, i worried about, coming in to sell more cars and trucks?  </seg>
<seg id="3">  but today i worry about, what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks?  </seg>
<seg id="4">  what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples, or even quadruples  </seg>
<seg id="5">  my life is guided by two great passions, and the first is automobiles  </seg>
<seg id="6">  i literally grew up with the ford motor company  </seg>
<seg id="7">  i thought i was so cool as a little boy when my dad would bring home the latest ford a lincolns and leave it in the driveway  </seg>
<seg id="8">  and it i decided about that time, about age ten, that would be really cool if i was a test driver  </seg>
<seg id="9">  so i counted go to dinner  </seg>
<seg id="10">  they'd sit down, i'd sneak out of the house  </seg>
<seg id="11">  i jump behind the wheel and take the new model around the driveway, and was a blast  </seg>
<seg id="12">  the net went on for about two years, until, i think there's about twelve, my dad brought home a a lincoln mark three  </seg>
<seg id="13">  and it was snowing that day  </seg>
<seg id="14">  so in went to dinner  </seg>
<seg id="15">  and i stuck out and not be really cool to do doughnuts and maybe even some figure eights in the snow  </seg>
<seg id="16">  my dad finished in early that evening  </seg>
<seg id="17">  and he was walking to the front hall and out the front door just about the same time i hit some ice and met him at the front door with the car, and almost ended up in the front hall  </seg>
<seg id="18">  so can i called my test-driving for a little while  </seg>
<seg id="19">  the height really began to love cars then  </seg>
<seg id="20">  and my first car was a nineteen seventy five electric green mustang  </seg>
<seg id="21">  and even though the color was pretty hideous, i did love the car, and really cemented my love affair with cars it's continued on this day  </seg>
<seg id="22">  but cars are really more than a passion of mine. they're quite literally in my blood  </seg>
<seg id="23">  my great grandfather was henry ford, and on my mother's side, of my great grandfather was harvey firestone  </seg>
<seg id="24">  so when i was born, i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me  </seg>
<seg id="25">  but my great grandfather, henry ford, really believe that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people's lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could happen  </seg>
<seg id="26">  because he believed that, with mobility, comes freedom and progress  </seg>
<seg id="27">  and that's a belief that i share  </seg>
<seg id="28">  well the great passion is the environment  </seg>
<seg id="29">  and as young boy, i used to go up to northern michigan and fish in the rivers that hemingway fished in and then later wrote about  </seg>
<seg id="30">  and it really struck me in as the years went by, in a in a very negative way, when i would go to some stream that i'd loved, and was used to walk into this field that was once filled with fireflies, and now head strip mall or about condos on it  </seg>
<seg id="31">  and so even at a young age, that really resonated with me  </seg>
<seg id="32">  and and the whole notion of environmental preservation, at a very basic level, sunk in with me  </seg>
<seg id="33">  as a high school, i started to read authors like throw elderly appalled and edward abbey  </seg>
<seg id="34">  a and i really began to develop a deeper appreciation of the natural world  </seg>
<seg id="35">  but it never really occurred to me that my love of cars and in trucks would ever be in conflict with nature  </seg>
<seg id="36">  and that was true until i got to college  </seg>
<seg id="37">  and what i got to college, you can imagine my surprise when i would go to class and a number of my professors would say that ford motor company and my family was kind of everything that was wrong with a lot of our country  </seg>
<seg id="38">  they thought that we were more interested, as an industry, in profits, rather than progress, and that we filled the skies with smog, and frankly, we were the enemy  </seg>
<seg id="39">  i joined ford after college, after some soul-searching whether not this is really the right thing to do  </seg>
<seg id="40">  but i decided that i wanted to go and see if i could affect change there  </seg>
<seg id="41">  and as i look back over thirty years ago, i was a little naive to think at that age that i could, but i wanted to  </seg>
<seg id="42">  i really discovered that my professors were completely wrong  </seg>
<seg id="43">  in fact, when i got back to detroit, my environmental leanings one exactly embraced by those in my own company, and certainly by those in the industry  </seg>
<seg id="44">  i it's very interesting conversations, are is you can imagine  </seg>
<seg id="45">  there were some are within ford who believed that all this ecological nonsense should just disappear and that i needed to stop hanging out with quote environmental wackos  </seg>
<seg id="46">  i was considered a radical  </seg>
<seg id="47">  i'll never forget the day i was called in by a member of top management and told to stop associating with any known or suspected environmentalists  </seg>
<seg id="48">  chris i had no intention of of doing that  </seg>
<seg id="49">  and i kept speaking out about the environment  </seg>
<seg id="50">  and it really was the topic that we now today call sustainability  </seg>
<seg id="51">  and in time, my views went from controversy o two more less consensus today  </seg>
<seg id="52">  i mean, i think most people in the industry understand that we've got to get on with it  </seg>
<seg id="53">  and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues, of of cars and the environment, not only for, the really as an industry  </seg>
<seg id="54">  we're pushing fuel efficiency to new heights  </seg>
<seg id="55">  there was no technology, we're reducing, and i believe, someday we'll eliminate, CO two emissions  </seg>
<seg id="56">  we're starting to sell electric cars, which is great  </seg>
<seg id="57">  we're developing alternative powertrains that are going to make the our cars affordable in every sense of the word, economically, socially and environmentally  </seg>
<seg id="58">  and actually, although we've got a long way to go and a lot of work to do, i can see the day when my two great passions, cars and the environment, actually come into harmony  </seg>
<seg id="59">  but unfortunately, as were our way to solving one monstrous problem, and as i said, we're not there yet. we've got a lot of work to do, but i can see where we will, but it even as we're in the process of doing that, another huge problem is looming, and people are noticing  </seg>
<seg id="60">  and that is the freedom of mobility that my great grandfather brought to people is now being threatened just as the environment is  </seg>
<seg id="61">  the problem, put in its simplest terms, is one of mathematics  </seg>
<seg id="62">  today there are approximately six point eight billion people in the world  </seg>
<seg id="63">  and within our lifetime, that number's going to grow to about nine billion  </seg>
<seg id="64">  in it that population level, our planet will be dealing with the limits of growth  </seg>
<seg id="65">  and with that growth comes some severe practical problems, one of which is our transportation system simply won't be able to deal with that  </seg>
<seg id="66">  when we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer  </seg>
<seg id="67">  today there are about eight hundred million cars on the road worldwide  </seg>
<seg id="68">  and but with more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number's going to grow to between two and four billion cars by mid-century  </seg>
<seg id="69">  and this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world is never seen before  </seg>
<seg id="70">  let's think about the impact that this is going to have our daily lives  </seg>
<seg id="71">  today the average american spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams  </seg>
<seg id="72">  and that's a huge waste of time and resources  </seg>
<seg id="73">  but that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest  </seg>
<seg id="74">  today the average driver in beijing has a five hour commute  </seg>
<seg id="75">  and last summer, many of you probably saw this, there was a hundred mile traffic jam that took eleven days to clear in china  </seg>
<seg id="76">  in the decades to come, seventy five percent of the world's population will live in cities, and fifty of those cities will be of ten million people or more  </seg>
<seg id="77">  so you can see the size of the issue that we're facing  </seg>
<seg id="78">  when you factor in population growth, it's clear that the mobility model that we have today simply will not work tomorrow  </seg>
<seg id="79">  frankly, four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars  </seg>
<seg id="80">  and a traffic jam with no emissions is still a traffic jam  </seg>
<seg id="81">  so health, if we make no changes today, what tomorrow look like?  </seg>
<seg id="82">  like think you probably already have the picture  </seg>
<seg id="83">  traffic jams are just a symptom of this challenge, and they're really very, very inconvenient, but that's kind of all they are  </seg>
<seg id="84">  but the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care, particularly to people that live in city centres  </seg>
<seg id="85">  and our quality of life is going to be severely compromised  </seg>
<seg id="86">  so what's going to solve this?  </seg>
<seg id="87">  well the answer isn't going to be more of the same  </seg>
<seg id="88">  my great grandfather once said before he invented the model t, if i ask people than what they wanted, they would have answered, we want faster forces. so the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads  </seg>
<seg id="89">  what america began moving west, we can add more wagon trains, we built railroads  </seg>
<seg id="90">  and to connect our country after world war two, we didn't build more two-lane highways, we built the interstate highway system  </seg>
<seg id="91">  today we need that same leap and thinking for us to create a viable future  </seg>
<seg id="92">  we are going to build smart cars, but we also need to build smart roads, smart parking, smart public transportation systems and more  </seg>
<seg id="93">  we don't want to waste their time sitting in traffic, sitting at all those or looking for parking spots  </seg>
<seg id="94">  we need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers  </seg>
<seg id="95">  if i could have the kind of system that's going to make the future of of personal mobility sustainable  </seg>
<seg id="96">  now the good news is some of this work is already begun in different parts of the world  </seg>
<seg id="97">  the city of mass star in upper darby uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another, and they go underneath the city streets  </seg>
<seg id="98">  up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways  </seg>
<seg id="99">  a new york city's thirty four street, gridlock will soon be replaced with a connected system of vehicle specific orders  </seg>
<seg id="100">  pedestrian zones in dedicated traffic lanes are going to be created, and all of this will look cut down the average rush hour commute to get across town in new york from about an hour today at rush hour to about twenty minutes  </seg>
<seg id="101">  now if you look at hong kong, they have a very interesting system paul arctic was there  </seg>
<seg id="102">  it's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system  </seg>
<seg id="103">  so parking garages, buses, trains, they all operate within the same system  </seg>
<seg id="104">  now shared power services are also springing up around the world  </seg>
<seg id="105">  and these efforts, i think are great  </seg>
<seg id="106">  the relieving congestion, and they're frankly starting to save some fuel  </seg>
<seg id="107">  these are all really good ideas that will move us forward  </seg>
<seg id="108">  but what really inspires me is what's really possible what our cars can begin talking to each other  </seg>
<seg id="109">  very soon, the same system that we use today to bring music and in entertainment and GPS information into our vehicles are going to be used to create a smart vehicle network  </seg>
<seg id="110">  every morning i drive about thirty miles from my home in ann arbor to my office and you're one, michigan  </seg>
<seg id="111">  and every night i go home, my commute is a total crapshoot  </seg>
<seg id="112">  and i often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home  </seg>
<seg id="113">  but very soon we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other  </seg>
<seg id="114">  so if the car ahead of me and i ninety four hits traffic, it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way  </seg>
<seg id="115">  and these systems are being tested right now, and frankly they're going to be ready for prime time pretty soon  </seg>
<seg id="116">  but the potential of a connected car network is almost live limitless  </seg>
<seg id="117">  one day very soon, you'll be able to plan a trip downtown in your car will be connected to a smart parking system  </seg>
<seg id="118">  so you get your car, and as you get in your car, your car will reserve you parking spot before you arrive, no more driving around looking for one, which frankly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today's cars and in urban areas is looking for parking spots  </seg>
<seg id="119">  or think about being in new york city and tracking down an intelligent cab on your smartphone so you don't have to wait and the cold to hail one  </seg>
<seg id="120">  or being in the future ted conference and having your car talk to the calendars of everybody here and telling you all the best route to take home and when you should leave, so the goal arriving here next destination on time  </seg>
<seg id="121">  this is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system  </seg>
<seg id="122">  so i think it's clear we have the beginnings of a solution to this enormous problem  </seg>
<seg id="123">  but as we found out with addressing CO two issues, and also fossil fuels, there is no one silver bullet  </seg>
<seg id="124">  the solution is not going to be more cars, more roads or new rail system. it can only be found, i believe, in a global network of interconnected solutions  </seg>
<seg id="125">  now i know we can develop the technology that's going to make this work, we gotta be willing to get out there and seek out the solutions, whether that means vehicle sharing or public transportation or some other way we haven't even thought of yet, our overall transportation mix an infrastructure must support all the future options  </seg>
<seg id="126">  we need our best and our brightest to start entertaining this issue  </seg>
<seg id="127">  companies, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, they all need to understand this is a huge business opportunity, is well as an enormous social problem  </seg>
<seg id="128">  and just as these groups embrace the green energy challenge, and i was really been amazing to me to watch how much brain power, how much money and how much serious thought isn't, it over the last three, really three years is poured into the green energy field  </seg>
<seg id="129">  we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock  </seg>
<seg id="130">  we need people like all of you in this room, leading thinkers  </seg>
<seg id="131">  and frankly i really need all of you to think about how you can help solve this this huge issue  </seg>
<seg id="132">  and we need people from all walks of life. not just inventors, we need policymakers in government officials to also think about how they're going to respond to this challenge  </seg>
<seg id="133">  this is going to be solved by any one person or one group  </seg>
<seg id="134">  it's going to really require a national energy policy of frankly for each country, because the solutions in each country are going to be different based upon income levels, traffic jams and also how integrated the the systems already are  </seg>
<seg id="135">  but we need to get going, and we need to get going today  </seg>
<seg id="136">  and we must have an infrastructure that's designed to support this flexible future  </seg>
<seg id="137">  you know, we've come a long way  </seg>
<seg id="138">  since the model t, most people never traveled more than twenty five miles from home and their entire lifetime  </seg>
<seg id="139">  and since then, but the automobile has allowed us the freedom to choose where we live, where we work, where we play and frankly when we just go out and want to move around  </seg>
<seg id="140">  we don't want to regress we lose that freedom  </seg>
<seg id="141">  we're on our way to solving, and as i said earlier, i know that a long way to go, the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it, and that's the environmental issue, but i believe we all must turn all over africa and all over ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock  </seg>
<seg id="142">  because in doing so, we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted, which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world  </seg>
<seg id="143">  and and and frankly will enhance our quality of life if we fix this  </seg>
<seg id="144">  because, if you can envision, as i do, a future of zero emissions in freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today, that's worth of hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow  </seg>
<seg id="145">  i believe we're at our best when we're confronted with the issues  </seg>
<seg id="146">  this is a big one and it won't wait  </seg>
<seg id="147">  so let's get started now  </seg>
<seg id="148">  thank you  </seg>

    <description>New York was planning to tear down the High Line, an abandoned elevated railroad in Manhattan, when Robert Hammond and a few friends suggested: Why not make it a park? He shares how it happened in this tale of local cultural activism.</description>
    <keywords>Arts,Culture,activism,cities</keywords>
    <talkid>1182</talkid>
    <title>Robert Hammond: Building a park in the sky</title>
<seg id="1">  the high line is an old, elevated rail line that runs for a mile and a half right through manhattan  </seg>
<seg id="2">  and it was originally a freight line that ran down ten thousand  </seg>
<seg id="3">  and it became known as death avenue because so many people were run over by the trains that the railroad hired a guy in first back to run in front, and he became known as the west side cowboy  </seg>
<seg id="4">  but even with a cowboy, about one person in a month was killed and run over  </seg>
<seg id="5">  so the elevated it  </seg>
<seg id="6">  they built a thirty feet, in the air right through the middle of the city  </seg>
<seg id="7">  but with the rise of interstate trucking, it was used a less and less  </seg>
<seg id="8">  and by nineteen eighty the last train rode  </seg>
<seg id="9">  it was a train motor frozen turkeys, they say, at thanksgiving, from the meatpacking district  </seg>
<seg id="10">  and that it was abandoned  </seg>
<seg id="11">  and i live in the neighborhood, and i first read about it in the new york times, in articles that it said it was going to be demolished  </seg>
<seg id="12">  and i assume someone was working to preserve it or save it i volunteer, but i realized no one was doing anything  </seg>
<seg id="13">  i would my first community board meeting, which i'd never been to one before, and sat next to another guy named joshua david, was a travel writer  </seg>
<seg id="14">  and at the end of the meeting, we realize we're the only two people there were so interest in the project. was people wanted to tear it down  </seg>
<seg id="15">  so we exchanged business cards, and we kept calling each other and decided to start this organisation, friends of the high line  </seg>
<seg id="16">  and the goal at first was just saving it from demolition, but then we also wanted to figure out what we could do with it  </seg>
<seg id="17">  and what first attracted me, are interested me, with this this view from the street, which is this you know steel structure, was a rusty, this industrial relic  </seg>
<seg id="18">  but when i went up on top, it was a mile and a half of wildflowers running right through the middle of manhattan you know with views of the empire state building and the statue of liberty and had some river  </seg>
<seg id="19">  and that's really where we started, the idea of coalesced around, let's make this a park, and let's have it be sort of inspired by this a wild skate  </seg>
<seg id="20">  at the time, there was a lot of opposition  </seg>
<seg id="21">  mayor giuliani wanted to tear it down  </seg>
<seg id="22">  i'm a fast forward to a lot of lawsuits and a lot of sort of community engagement  </seg>
<seg id="23">  mayor bloomberg came in office, he was very supportive, but we still have to make the economic case  </seg>
<seg id="24">  this was after nine allowed in. the city was in tough times  </seg>
<seg id="25">  so we commissioned an economic feasibility study to try to make the case  </seg>
<seg id="26">  and it turns out, we got those numbers wrong  </seg>
<seg id="27">  we said it would cost a hundred million dollars to build  </seg>
<seg id="28">  so far it's cost about a hundred and fifty million  </seg>
<seg id="29">  and the the main case was, this is going to make good economic sense for the city  </seg>
<seg id="30">  so we said over twenty year time period, the value to the city and increased property values and increased taxes would be about two hundred fifty million  </seg>
<seg id="31">  that was enough. it really got the city behind it  </seg>
<seg id="32">  it turns out we were wrong on that  </seg>
<seg id="33">  now people estimate it's created about has a billion dollars, and will create about half a billion dollars, in tax revenues for the city  </seg>
<seg id="34">  we did a design competition, selected the design team  </seg>
<seg id="35">  we worked with them to really create a design that was inspired by that sort of wild skate  </seg>
<seg id="36">  there's three sections  </seg>
<seg id="37">  we open the first section in two thousand nine  </seg>
<seg id="38">  it's been so successful beyond our dreams  </seg>
<seg id="39">  last year we had about two million people, which is about ten times what we ever estimated  </seg>
<seg id="40">  this is one of my favorite features in section one  </seg>
<seg id="41">  it's this amphitheater right over ten thousand  </seg>
<seg id="42">  on the first section in the twentieth street right now  </seg>
<seg id="43">  the other thing, it's generated, obviously, a lot of economic value. it's also inspired, i think, a lot of great architecture is  </seg>
<seg id="44">  there's a point, where you can stand here and see buildings by frank gehry, jean new bell, sugar bond, yields and ari  </seg>
<seg id="45">  and the whitney is moving downtown and is building that their new museum right at the base of the high line  </seg>
<seg id="46">  in this is being designed by renzo piano  </seg>
<seg id="47">  and they're going to break ground in may  </seg>
<seg id="48">  and we've already started construction on section two  </seg>
<seg id="49">  this is one of my favorite features, this flyover where year eight feet off the surface of the high line, running through a canopy of trees  </seg>
<seg id="50">  the high line used to be covered in billboards, and so we've sort of taken a playful take where instead of framing advertising, and it's because frame people and views of the city  </seg>
<seg id="51">  this was just installed last month  </seg>
<seg id="52">  and then the last section it was going to go around the rail yards, which is the largest undeveloped site in manhattan  </seg>
<seg id="53">  and the city has planned, for better for worse, at twelve million square feet of development the line is going to ring around  </seg>
<seg id="54">  but you know, what really, i think, makes the high line special is the people  </seg>
<seg id="55">  and honestly, even though i love the designs that we're building, i was always frightened that i wouldn't really love it, because i fell love without wild escape, and how could you re-create that magic?  </seg>
<seg id="56">  but what i found is it is it's in the people and how they use it that, to me, makes it so special  </seg>
<seg id="57">  just one quick example is i realize right after we opened that they're all these people holding hands on the high line  </seg>
<seg id="58">  i realized new yorkers don't hold his that. we just don't do that and outside fate  </seg>
<seg id="59">  well you see that happening on the high line, and i think that's you know the power that the public space can have to transform how people experience the city and interact with each other  </seg>
<seg id="60">  thank you for  </seg>

    <title>Matt Cutts: Try something new for 30 days</title>
<seg id="1">  a few years ago, i felt like i was stuck in a rut, so i decided to follow in the footsteps of the great american philosopher, morgan spurlock, and try something new for thirty days  </seg>
<seg id="2">  the idea is actually pretty simple  </seg>
<seg id="3">  think about something you've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next thirty days  </seg>
<seg id="4">  it turns out, thirty days is just about the right amount of time to have new habit or subtract a habit, like watching the news, from your life  </seg>
<seg id="5">  there's a few things that i learned while doing these thirty day challenges  </seg>
<seg id="6">  the first was, instead of the months flying by, forgotten, the time was much more memorable  </seg>
<seg id="7">  this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month  </seg>
<seg id="8">  and i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing that day  </seg>
<seg id="9">  i also noticed that as i started to do more and harder thirty day challenges, my self-confidence grew  </seg>
<seg id="10">  i went from death dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work, for fun  </seg>
<seg id="11">  even last year, i ended up hiking up mount kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in africa  </seg>
<seg id="12">  i would never have been dead adventurous before i started my thirty day challenges  </seg>
<seg id="13">  i also figured out that if you really want something badly enough, you can do anything for thirty days  </seg>
<seg id="14">  if you're wanted write a novel?  </seg>
<seg id="15">  every november, tens of thousands of people try to write their own fifty thousand word novel from scratch in thirty days  </seg>
<seg id="16">  it turns out, all you have to do is write sixteen hundred and sixty seven words a day for a month  </seg>
<seg id="17">  so i did  </seg>
<seg id="18">  by the way, the secret is not to go to sleep and so you've written your words for the day  </seg>
<seg id="19">  you might be sleep-deprived, but you'll finish a novel  </seg>
<seg id="20">  now is my book the next great american novel?  </seg>
<seg id="21">  now all i wrote in a month  </seg>
<seg id="22">  it's cool  </seg>
<seg id="23">  but for the rest of my life, if i meet john hodge and meditate party, i don't have to say, i'm a computer scientist  </seg>
<seg id="24">  now, now, if i want to i can say, i'm a novelist  </seg>
<seg id="25">  so here's one last thing i'd like to mention  </seg>
<seg id="26">  i learned that when i made small, sustainable changes, things i could keep doing, they're more likely to stick  </seg>
<seg id="27">  there's nothing wrong with big, crazy challenges  </seg>
<seg id="28">  in fact, there a ton of fun  </seg>
<seg id="29">  but they're less likely to stick  </seg>
<seg id="30">  when i gave up sugar for thirty days, day thirty one looked like this  </seg>
<seg id="31">  so here's my question to you, what do you waiting for?  </seg>
<seg id="32">  i guarantee you the next thirty days are going to pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you've always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next thirty days  </seg>
<seg id="33">  thanks  </seg>

    <title>Nina Tandon: Caring for engineered tissue</title>
<seg id="1">  good morning everybody  </seg>
<seg id="2">  i work with really amazing that will itty-bitty creatures called cells  </seg>
<seg id="3">  and let me tell you what it's like to grow these cells in the lab  </seg>
<seg id="4">  i work in the lab where we take cells out of their native environment  </seg>
<seg id="5">  we played them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes  </seg>
<seg id="6">  and we feed them, stay early of course, with what we call cell culture media, which is like their food and we grow them in incubators  </seg>
<seg id="7">  why do i do this?  </seg>
<seg id="8">  we observe the cells in a plate, and there know just on the surface  </seg>
<seg id="9">  but what we're really trying to do in my lab is to engineer tissues out of that  </seg>
<seg id="10">  what does that even mean?  </seg>
<seg id="11">  well it means growing in actual heart, let's say, or grow a piece of bone that can be put into the body  </seg>
<seg id="12">  not only that, but they can also be used for disease models  </seg>
<seg id="13">  i'm going to purpose, traditional cell culture techniques just really aren't enough  </seg>
<seg id="14">  the cells are kind of homesick. the dish doesn't feel like their home  </seg>
<seg id="15">  and so we need to do better at copying their natural environment to get them to thrive  </seg>
<seg id="16">  we call this the by in the medical paradigm, copying nature in the lab  </seg>
<seg id="17">  let's take the example of the heart, the topic of a lot of my research  </seg>
<seg id="18">  what makes the heart unique?  </seg>
<seg id="19">  well, the heart beats rhythmically, tirelessly, faithfully  </seg>
<seg id="20">  we copy this in the land by outfitting cell culture systems with electrodes  </seg>
<seg id="21">  these electrodes act like mini pacemakers to get the cells contract in the lab  </seg>
<seg id="22">  what else do we know about the heart?  </seg>
<seg id="23">  well heart cells are pretty greedy  </seg>
<seg id="24">  nature feeds the heart cells in your body with a very, very dense blood supply  </seg>
<seg id="25">  in the lab, we might for patterns channels in the by materials on which we grow the cells  </seg>
<seg id="26">  and this allows us to flow the cell culture media, the cells food, through the scaffolds were growing the cells, a lot like what you might expect from a cap larry capillary bed in the heart  </seg>
<seg id="27">  so this brings me to lesson number one, life can do a lot with very little  </seg>
<seg id="28">  let's take the example of electrical stimulation  </seg>
<seg id="29">  let's see how powerful just one of these essentials can be  </seg>
<seg id="30">  on the left, we see a tiny piece of beating heart tissue that they engineered from rat cells in the lab  </seg>
<seg id="31">  it's about the size of a mini marshmallow  </seg>
<seg id="32">  after one week, it's beating  </seg>
<seg id="33">  you can see it up in the upper left-hand corner  </seg>
<seg id="34">  the door if you can see it so well  </seg>
<seg id="35">  it's amazing that these cells beat at all  </seg>
<seg id="36">  but what's really amazing is that the cells, when we electrically stimulate them like with a pacemaker, that they be so much more  </seg>
<seg id="37">  that brings me to lesson number jim, cells do all the work  </seg>
<seg id="38">  in a sense, tissue engineers have a bit of an identity crisis here, because, you know, a structural engineers build bridges and big things, computer engineers, computers, but what we are doing is actually building enabling technologies for the cells themselves  </seg>
<seg id="39">  what is this mean for us?  </seg>
<seg id="40">  let's do something really simple  </seg>
<seg id="41">  let's remind ourselves that cells are not an abstract concept  </seg>
<seg id="42">  let's remember that our cells sustain our lives in a very real way  </seg>
<seg id="43">  we are what we eat, could easily be described as, we are what our cells eat  </seg>
<seg id="44">  and in the case of the flora in our gut, these cells may not even be human  </seg>
<seg id="45">  but it's also worth noting that cells also mediate our experience of life  </seg>
<seg id="46">  behind every sound, sight, touch, taste and smell is a corresponding set of cells that receive this information and interpret it for us  </seg>
<seg id="47">  it begs the question, cell we expand our sense of environmental stewardship to include the ecosystem of our own bodies?  </seg>
<seg id="48">  i invite you to talk about this with me further, and in the meantime, i wish you luck  </seg>
<seg id="49">  may none of your in on cancer cells become endangered species  </seg>
<seg id="50">  thank you  </seg>
