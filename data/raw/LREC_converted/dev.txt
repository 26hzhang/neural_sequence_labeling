adrian  kohler ,COMMA well ,COMMA we  're  here  today  to  talk  about  the  evolution  of  a  puppet  horse .PERIOD basil  jones ,COMMA but  actually  we  're  going  to  start  this  evolution  with  a  hyena .PERIOD ak ,COMMA the  ancestor  of  the  horse .PERIOD okay ,COMMA we  'll  do  something  with  it .PERIOD hahahaha .PERIOD the  hyena  is  the  ancestor  of  the  horse  because  it  was  part  of  a  production  called  faustus  in  africa ,COMMA a  handspring  production  from  1995 ,COMMA where  it  had  to  play  draughts  with  helen  of  troy .PERIOD this  production  was  directed  by  south  african  artist  and  theater  director ,COMMA william  kentridge .PERIOD so  it  needed  a  very  articulate  front  paw .PERIOD but ,COMMA like  all  puppets ,COMMA it  has  other  attributes .PERIOD bj ,COMMA one  of  them  is  breath ,COMMA and  it  kind  of  breathes .PERIOD ak ,COMMA haa  haa  haaa .PERIOD bj ,COMMA breath  is  really  important  for  us .PERIOD it  's  the  kind  of  original  movement  for  any  puppet  for  us  onstage .PERIOD it  's  the  thing  that  distinguishes  the  puppet ,COMMA ak ,COMMA oops .PERIOD bj ,COMMA from  an  actor .PERIOD puppets  always  have  to  try  to  be  alive .PERIOD it  's  their  kind  of  ur-story  onstage ,COMMA that  desperation  to  live .PERIOD ak ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA it  's  basically  a  dead  object ,COMMA as  you  can  see ,COMMA and  it  only  lives  because  you  make  it .PERIOD an  actor  struggles  to  die  onstage ,COMMA but  a  puppet  has  to  struggle  to  live .PERIOD and  in  a  way  that  's  a  metaphor  for  life .PERIOD bj ,COMMA so  every  moment  it  's  on  the  stage ,COMMA it  's  making  the  struggle .PERIOD so  we  call  this  a  piece  of  emotional  engineering  that  uses  up-to-the-minute  17th  century  technology ,COMMA to  turn  nouns  into  verbs .PERIOD ak ,COMMA well  actually  i  prefer  to  say  that  it  's  an  object  constructed  out  of  wood  and  cloth  with  movement  built  into  it  to  persuade  you  to  believe  that  it  has  life .PERIOD bj ,COMMA okay  so .PERIOD ak ,COMMA it  has  ears  that  move  passively  when  the  head  goes .PERIOD bj ,COMMA and  it  has  these  bulkheads  made  out  of  plywood ,COMMA covered  with  fabric ,COMMA curiously  similar ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA to  the  plywood  canoes  that  adrian  's  father  used  to  make  when  he  was  a  boy  in  their  workshop .PERIOD ak ,COMMA in  port  elizabeth ,COMMA the  village  outside  port  elizabeth  in  south  africa .PERIOD bj ,COMMA his  mother  was  a  puppeteer .PERIOD and  when  we  met  at  art  school  and  fell  in  love  in  1971 ,COMMA i  hated  puppets .PERIOD i  really  thought  they  were  so  beneath  me .PERIOD i  wanted  to  become  an  avant-garde  artist ,COMMA and  punch  and  judy  was  certainly  not  where  i  wanted  to  go .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA it  took  about  10  years .PERIOD to  discover  the  bambara  bamana  puppets  of  mali  in  west  africa ,COMMA where  there  's  a  fabulous  tradition  of  puppetry ,COMMA to  learn  a  renewed ,COMMA or  a  new ,COMMA respect  for  this  art  form .PERIOD ak ,COMMA so  in  1981 ,COMMA i  persuaded  basil  and  some  friends  of  mine  to  form  a  puppet  company .PERIOD and  20  years  later ,COMMA miraculously ,COMMA we  collaborated  with  a  company  from  mali ,COMMA the  sogolon  marionette  troupe  of  bamako ,COMMA where  we  made  a  piece  about  a  tall  giraffe .PERIOD it  was  just  called  tall  horse ,COMMA which  was  a  life-sized  giraffe .PERIOD bj ,COMMA and  here  again ,COMMA you  see  the  same  structure .PERIOD the  bulkheads  have  now  turned  into  hoops  of  cane ,COMMA but  it  's  ultimately  the  same  structure .PERIOD it  's  got  two  people  inside  it  on  stilts ,COMMA which  give  them  the  height ,COMMA and  somebody  in  the  front  who  's  using  a  kind  of  steering  wheel  to  move  that  head .PERIOD ak ,COMMA the  person  in  the  hind  legs  is  also  controlling  the  tail ,COMMA a  bit  like  the  hyena ,COMMA same  mechanism ,COMMA just  a  bit  bigger .PERIOD and  he  's  controlling  the  ear  movement .PERIOD bj ,COMMA so  this  production  was  seen  by  tom  morris  of  the  national  theatre  in  london .PERIOD and  just  around  that  time ,COMMA his  mother  had  said ,COMMA have  you  seen  this  book  by  michael  morpurgo  called  war  horse' ?QUESTIONMARK ak ,COMMA it  's  about  a  boy  who  falls  in  love  with  a  horse .PERIOD the  horse  is  sold  to  the  first  world  war ,COMMA and  he  joins  up  to  find  his  horse .PERIOD bj ,COMMA so  tom  gave  us  a  call  and  said ,COMMA do  you  think  you  could  make  us  a  horse  for  a  show  to  happen  at  the  national  theatre ?QUESTIONMARK ak ,COMMA it  seemed  a  lovely  idea .PERIOD bj ,COMMA but  it  had  to  ride .PERIOD it  had  to  have  a  rider .PERIOD ak ,COMMA it  had  to  have  a  rider ,COMMA and  it  had  to  participate  in  cavalry  charges .PERIOD a  play  about  early  20th  century  plowing  technology  and  cavalry  charges  was  a  little  bit  of  a  challenge  for  the  accounting  department  at  the  national  theatre  in  london .PERIOD but  they  agreed  to  go  along  with  it  for  a  while .PERIOD so  we  began  with  a  test .PERIOD bj ,COMMA this  is  adrian  and  thys  stander ,COMMA who  went  on  to  actually  design  the  cane  system  for  the  horse ,COMMA and  our  next-door  neighbor  katherine ,COMMA riding  on  a  ladder .PERIOD the  weight  is  really  difficult  when  it  's  up  above  your  head .PERIOD ak ,COMMA and  once  we  put  katherine  through  that  particular  brand  of  hell ,COMMA we  knew  that  we  might  be  able  to  make  a  horse ,COMMA which  could  be  ridden .PERIOD so  we  made  a  model .PERIOD this  is  a  cardboard  model ,COMMA a  little  bit  smaller  than  the  hyena .PERIOD you  'll  notice  that  the  legs  are  plywood  legs  and  the  canoe  structure  is  still  there .PERIOD bj ,COMMA and  the  two  manipulators  are  inside .PERIOD but  we  did  n't  realize  at  the  time  that  we  actually  needed  a  third  manipulator ,COMMA because  we  could  n't  manipulate  the  neck  from  inside  and  walk  the  horse  at  the  same  time .PERIOD ak ,COMMA we  started  work  on  the  prototype  after  the  model  was  approved ,COMMA and  the  prototype  took  a  bit  longer  than  we  anticipated .PERIOD we  had  to  throw  out  the  plywood  legs  and  make  new  cane  ones .PERIOD and  we  had  a  crate  built  for  it .PERIOD it  had  to  be  shipped  to  london .PERIOD we  were  going  to  test-drive  it  on  the  street  outside  of  our  house  in  cape  town ,COMMA and  it  got  to  midnight  and  we  had  n't  done  that  yet .PERIOD bj ,COMMA so  we  got  a  camera ,COMMA and  we  posed  the  puppet  in  various  galloping  stances .PERIOD and  we  sent  it  off  to  the  national  theatre ,COMMA hoping  that  they  believed  that  we  created  something  that  worked .PERIOD ak ,COMMA a  month  later ,COMMA we  were  there  in  london  with  this  big  box  and  a  studio  full  of  people  about  to  work  with  us .PERIOD bj ,COMMA about  40  people .PERIOD ak ,COMMA we  were  terrified .PERIOD we  opened  the  lid ,COMMA we  took  the  horse  out ,COMMA and  it  did  work .PERIOD it  walked  and  it  was  able  to  be  ridden .PERIOD here  i  have  an  18-second  clip  of  the  very  first  walk  of  the  prototype .PERIOD this  is  in  the  national  theatre  studio ,COMMA the  place  where  they  cook  new  ideas .PERIOD it  had  by  no  means  got  the  green  light  yet .PERIOD the  choreographer ,COMMA toby  sedgwick ,COMMA invented  a  beautiful  sequence  where  the  baby  horse ,COMMA which  was  made  out  of  sticks  and  bits  of  twigs ,COMMA grew  up  into  the  big  horse .PERIOD and  nick  starr ,COMMA the  director  of  the  national  theatre ,COMMA saw  that  particular  moment ,COMMA he  was  standing  next  to  me ,COMMA he  nearly  wet  himself .PERIOD and  so  the  show  was  given  the  green  light .PERIOD and  we  went  back  to  cape  town  and  redesigned  the  horse  completely .PERIOD here  is  the  plan .PERIOD and  here  is  our  factory  in  cape  town  where  we  make  horses .PERIOD you  can  see  quite  a  lot  of  skeletons  in  the  background  there .PERIOD the  horses  are  completely  handmade .PERIOD there  is  very  little  20th  century  technology  in  them .PERIOD we  used  a  bit  of  laser  cutting  on  the  plywood  and  some  of  the  aluminum  pieces .PERIOD but  because  they  have  to  be  light  and  flexible ,COMMA and  each  one  of  them  is  different ,COMMA they  cannot  be  mass-produced ,COMMA unfortunately .PERIOD so  here  are  some  half-finished  horses  ready  to  be  worked  in  london .PERIOD and  now  we  would  like  to  introduce  you  to  joey .PERIOD joey  boy ,COMMA you  there ?QUESTIONMARK joey .PERIOD joey .PERIOD joey ,COMMA come  here .PERIOD no ,COMMA no ,COMMA i  have  n't  got  it .PERIOD he  's  got  it .PERIOD it  's  in  his  pocket .PERIOD bj ,COMMA joey .PERIOD ak ,COMMA joey ,COMMA joey ,COMMA joey ,COMMA joey .PERIOD come  here .PERIOD stand  here  where  people  can  see  you .PERIOD move  around .PERIOD come  on .PERIOD i'd  just  like  to  describe ,COMMA i  wo  n't  talk  too  loud .PERIOD he  might  get  irritated .PERIOD here ,COMMA craig  is  working  the  head .PERIOD he  has  bicycle  brake  cables  going  down  to  the  head  control  in  his  hand .PERIOD each  one  of  them  operates  either  an  ear ,COMMA separately ,COMMA or  the  head ,COMMA up  and  down .PERIOD but  he  also  controls  the  head  directly  by  using  his  hand .PERIOD the  ears  are  obviously  a  very  important  emotional  indicator  of  the  horse .PERIOD when  they  point  right  back ,COMMA the  horse  is  fearful  or  angry ,COMMA depending  upon  what  's  going  on  in  front  of  him ,COMMA around  him .PERIOD or ,COMMA when  he  's  more  relaxed ,COMMA the  head  comes  down  and  the  ears  listen ,COMMA either  side .PERIOD horses  hearing  is  very  important .PERIOD it  's  almost  more  important  than  their  eyesight .PERIOD over  here ,COMMA tommy  's  got  what  you  call  the  heart  position .PERIOD he  's  working  the  leg .PERIOD you  see  the  string  tendon  from  the  hyena ,COMMA the  hyena  's  front  leg ,COMMA automatically  pulls  the  hoop  up .PERIOD horses  are  so  unpredictable .PERIOD the  way  a  hoof  comes  up  with  a  horse  immediately  gives  you  the  feeling  that  it  's  a  convincing  horse  action .PERIOD the  hind  legs  have  got  the  same  action .PERIOD bj ,COMMA and  mikey  also  has ,COMMA in  his  fingers ,COMMA the  ability  to  move  the  tail  from  left  to  right ,COMMA and  up  and  down  with  the  other  hand .PERIOD and  together ,COMMA there  's  quite  a  complex  possibility  of  tail  expression .PERIOD ak ,COMMA you  want  to  say  something  about  the  breathing ?QUESTIONMARK bj ,COMMA we  had  a  big  challenge  with  breathing .PERIOD adrian  thought  that  he  was  going  to  have  to  split  the  chest  of  the  puppet  in  two  and  make  it  breathe  like  that ,COMMA because  that  's  how  a  horse  would  breathe ,COMMA with  an  expanded  chest .PERIOD but  we  realized  that ,COMMA if  that  were  to  be  happening ,COMMA you  would  n't ,COMMA as  an  audience ,COMMA see  the  breath .PERIOD so  he  made  a  channel  in  here ,COMMA and  the  chest  moves  up  and  down  in  that  channel .PERIOD so  it  's  anti-naturalistic  really ,COMMA the  up  and  down  movement ,COMMA but  it  feels  like  breath .PERIOD and  it  's  very ,COMMA very  simple  because  all  that  happens  is  that  the  puppeteer  breathes  with  his  knees .PERIOD ak ,COMMA other  emotional  stuff .PERIOD if  i  were  to  touch  the  horse  here  on  his  skin ,COMMA the  heart  puppeteer  can  shake  the  body  from  inside  and  get  the  skin  to  quiver .PERIOD you  'll  notice ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA that  the  puppet  is  made  out  of  cane  lines .PERIOD and  i  would  like  you  to  believe  that  it  was  an  aesthetic  choice ,COMMA that  i  was  making  a  three-dimensional  drawing  of  a  horse  that  somehow  moves  in  space .PERIOD but  of  course ,COMMA it  was  the  cane  is  light ,COMMA the  cane  is  flexible ,COMMA the  cane  is  durable  and  the  cane  is  moldable .PERIOD and  so  it  was  a  very  practical  reason  why  it  was  made  of  cane .PERIOD the  skin  itself  is  made  out  of  a  see-through  nylon  mesh ,COMMA which ,COMMA if  the  lighting  designer  wants  the  horse  to  almost  disappear ,COMMA she  can  light  the  background  and  the  horse  becomes  ghostlike .PERIOD you  see  the  skeletal  structure  of  it .PERIOD or  if  you  light  it  from  above ,COMMA it  becomes  more  solid .PERIOD again ,COMMA that  was  a  practical  consideration .PERIOD the  guys  inside  the  horse  have  to  be  able  to  see  out .PERIOD they  have  to  be  able  to  act  along  with  their  fellow  actors  in  the  production .PERIOD and  it  's  very  much  an  in-the-moment  activity  that  they  're  engaged  in .PERIOD it  's  three  heads  making  one  character .PERIOD but  now  we  would  like  you  to  put  joey  through  some  paces .PERIOD and  plant .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD and  now  just ,COMMA all  the  way  from  sunny  california  we  have  zem  joaquin  who  's  going  to  ride  the  horse  for  us .PERIOD so  we  would  like  to  stress  that  the  performance  you  see  in  the  horse  is  three  guys  who  have  studied  horse  behavior  incredibly  thoroughly .PERIOD bj ,COMMA not  being  able  to  talk  to  one  another  while  they  're  onstage  because  they  're  mic'd .PERIOD the  sound  that  that  very  large  chest  makes ,COMMA of  the  horse ,COMMA the  whinnying  and  the  nickering  and  everything ,COMMA that  starts  usually  with  one  performer ,COMMA carries  on  with  a  second  person  and  ends  with  a  third .PERIOD ak ,COMMA mikey  brett  from  leicestershire .PERIOD mikey  brett ,COMMA craig ,COMMA leo ,COMMA zem  joaquin  and  basil  and  me .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD one  of  the  most  common  ways  of  dividing  the  world  is  into  those  who  believe  and  those  who  do  n't ,COMMA into  the  religious  and  the  atheists .PERIOD and  for  the  last  decade  or  so ,COMMA it  's  been  quite  clear  what  being  an  atheist  means .PERIOD there  have  been  some  very  vocal  atheists  who've  pointed  out ,COMMA not  just  that  religion  is  wrong ,COMMA but  that  it  's  ridiculous .PERIOD these  people ,COMMA many  of  whom  have  lived  in  north  oxford ,COMMA have  argued ,COMMA they've  argued  that  believing  in  god  is  akin  to  believing  in  fairies  and  essentially  that  the  whole  thing  is  a  childish  game .PERIOD now  i  think  it  's  too  easy .PERIOD i  think  it  's  too  easy  to  dismiss  the  whole  of  religion  that  way .PERIOD and  it  's  as  easy  as  shooting  fish  in  a  barrel .PERIOD and  what  i'd  like  to  inaugurate  today  is  a  new  way  of  being  an  atheist ,COMMA if  you  like ,COMMA a  new  version  of  atheism  we  could  call  atheism  20 .PERIOD now  what  is  atheism  20 ?QUESTIONMARK well  it  starts  from  a  very  basic  premise ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA there  's  no  god .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA there  are  no  deities  or  supernatural  spirits  or  angels ,COMMA etc .PERIOD now  let  's  move  on .PERIOD that  's  not  the  end  of  the  story ,COMMA that  's  the  very ,COMMA very  beginning .PERIOD i  'm  interested  in  the  kind  of  constituency  that  thinks  something  along  these  lines ,COMMA that  thinks ,COMMA i  cannot  believe  in  any  of  this  stuff .PERIOD i  cannot  believe  in  the  doctrines .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  these  doctrines  are  right .PERIOD but ,COMMA a  very  important  but ,COMMA i  love  christmas  carols .PERIOD i  really  like  the  art  of  mantegna .PERIOD i  really  like  looking  at  old  churches .PERIOD i  really  like  turning  the  pages  of  the  old  testament  whatever  it  may  be ,COMMA you  know  the  kind  of  thing  i  'm  talking  about ,COMMA people  who  are  attracted  to  the  ritualistic  side ,COMMA the  moralistic ,COMMA communal  side  of  religion ,COMMA but  cannot  bear  the  doctrine .PERIOD until  now ,COMMA these  people  have  faced  a  rather  unpleasant  choice .PERIOD it  's  almost  as  though  either  you  accept  the  doctrine  and  then  you  can  have  all  the  nice  stuff ,COMMA or  you  reject  the  doctrine  and  you  're  living  in  some  kind  of  spiritual  wasteland  under  the  guidance  of  cnn  and  walmart .PERIOD so  that  's  a  sort  of  tough  choice .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  we  have  to  make  that  choice .PERIOD i  think  there  is  an  alternative .PERIOD i  think  there  are  ways ,COMMA and  i  'm  being  both  very  respectful  and  completely  impious ,COMMA of  stealing  from  religions .PERIOD if  you  do  n't  believe  in  a  religion ,COMMA there  's  nothing  wrong  with  picking  and  mixing ,COMMA with  taking  out  the  best  sides  of  religion .PERIOD and  for  me ,COMMA atheism  20  is  about  both ,COMMA as  i  say ,COMMA a  respectful  and  an  impious  way  of  going  through  religions  and  saying ,COMMA what  here  could  we  use  the  secular  world  is  full  of  holes .PERIOD we  have  secularized  badly ,COMMA i  would  argue .PERIOD and  a  thorough  study  of  religion  could  give  us  all  sorts  of  insights  into  areas  of  life  that  are  not  going  too  well .PERIOD and  i'd  like  to  run  through  a  few  of  these  today .PERIOD i'd  like  to  kick  off  by  looking  at  education .PERIOD now  education  is  a  field  the  secular  world  really  believes  in .PERIOD when  we  think  about  how  we  're  going  to  make  the  world  a  better  place ,COMMA we  think  education .PERIOD that  's  where  we  put  a  lot  of  money .PERIOD education  is  going  to  give  us ,COMMA not  only  commercial  skills ,COMMA industrial  skills ,COMMA it  's  also  going  to  make  us  better  people .PERIOD you  know  the  kind  of  thing  a  commencement  address  is ,COMMA and  graduation  ceremonies ,COMMA those  lyrical  claims  that  education ,COMMA the  process  of  education ,COMMA particularly  higher  education ,COMMA will  make  us  into  nobler  and  better  human  beings .PERIOD that  's  a  lovely  idea .PERIOD interesting  where  it  came  from .PERIOD in  the  early  19th  century ,COMMA church  attendance  in  western  europe  started  sliding  down  very ,COMMA very  sharply ,COMMA and  people  panicked .PERIOD they  asked  themselves  the  following  question .PERIOD they  said ,COMMA where  are  people  going  to  find  the  morality ,COMMA where  are  they  going  to  find  guidance ,COMMA and  where  are  they  going  to  find  sources  of  consolation ?QUESTIONMARK and  influential  voices  came  up  with  one  answer .PERIOD they  said  culture .PERIOD it  's  to  culture  that  we  should  look  for  guidance ,COMMA for  consolation ,COMMA for  morality .PERIOD let  's  look  to  the  plays  of  shakespeare ,COMMA the  dialogues  of  plato ,COMMA the  novels  of  jane  austen .PERIOD in  there ,COMMA we  'll  find  a  lot  of  the  truths  that  we  might  previously  have  found  in  the  gospel  of  saint  john .PERIOD now  i  think  that  's  a  very  beautiful  idea  and  a  very  true  idea .PERIOD they  wanted  to  replace  scripture  with  culture .PERIOD and  that  's  a  very  plausible  idea .PERIOD it  's  also  an  idea  that  we  have  forgotten .PERIOD if  you  went  to  a  top  university ,COMMA let  's  say  you  went  to  harvard  or  oxford  or  cambridge ,COMMA and  you  said ,COMMA i've  come  here  because  i  'm  in  search  of  morality ,COMMA guidance  and  consolation .PERIOD i  want  to  know  how  to  live ,COMMA they  would  show  you  the  way  to  the  insane  asylum .PERIOD this  is  simply  not  what  our  grandest  and  best  institutes  of  higher  learning  are  in  the  business  of .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK they  do  n't  think  we  need  it .PERIOD they  do  n't  think  we  are  in  an  urgent  need  of  assistance .PERIOD they  see  us  as  adults ,COMMA rational  adults .PERIOD what  we  need  is  information .PERIOD we  need  data ,COMMA we  do  n't  need  help .PERIOD now  religions  start  from  a  very  different  place  indeed .PERIOD all  religions ,COMMA all  major  religions ,COMMA at  various  points  call  us  children .PERIOD and  like  children ,COMMA they  believe  that  we  are  in  severe  need  of  assistance .PERIOD we  're  only  just  holding  it  together .PERIOD perhaps  this  is  just  me ,COMMA maybe  you .PERIOD but  anyway ,COMMA we  're  only  just  holding  it  together .PERIOD and  we  need  help .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA we  need  help .PERIOD and  so  we  need  guidance  and  we  need  didactic  learning .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA in  the  18th  century  in  the  uk ,COMMA the  greatest  preacher ,COMMA greatest  religious  preacher ,COMMA was  a  man  called  john  wesley ,COMMA who  went  up  and  down  this  country  delivering  sermons ,COMMA advising  people  how  they  could  live .PERIOD he  delivered  sermons  on  the  duties  of  parents  to  their  children  and  children  to  their  parents ,COMMA the  duties  of  the  rich  to  the  poor  and  the  poor  to  the  rich .PERIOD he  was  trying  to  tell  people  how  they  should  live  through  the  medium  of  sermons ,COMMA the  classic  medium  of  delivery  of  religions .PERIOD now  we've  given  up  with  the  idea  of  sermons .PERIOD if  you  said  to  a  modern  liberal  individualist ,COMMA hey ,COMMA how  about  a  sermon  they'd  go ,COMMA no ,COMMA no .PERIOD i  do  n't  need  one  of  those .PERIOD i  'm  an  independent ,COMMA individual  person  what  's  the  difference  between  a  sermon  and  our  modern ,COMMA secular  mode  of  delivery ,COMMA the  lecture ?QUESTIONMARK well  a  sermon  wants  to  change  your  life  and  a  lecture  wants  to  give  you  a  bit  of  information .PERIOD and  i  think  we  need  to  get  back  to  that  sermon  tradition .PERIOD the  tradition  of  sermonizing  is  hugely  valuable ,COMMA because  we  are  in  need  of  guidance ,COMMA morality  and  consolation ,COMMA and  religions  know  that .PERIOD another  point  about  education ,COMMA we  tend  to  believe  in  the  modern  secular  world  that  if  you  tell  someone  something  once ,COMMA they  'll  remember  it .PERIOD sit  them  in  a  classroom ,COMMA tell  them  about  plato  at  the  age  of  20 ,COMMA send  them  out  for  a  career  in  management  consultancy  for  40  years ,COMMA and  that  lesson  will  stick  with  them .PERIOD religions  go ,COMMA nonsense .PERIOD you  need  to  keep  repeating  the  lesson  10  times  a  day .PERIOD so  get  on  your  knees  and  repeat  it  that  's  what  all  religions  tell  us ,COMMA get  on  you  knees  and  repeat  it  10  or  20  or  15  times  a  day  otherwise  our  minds  are  like  sieves .PERIOD so  religions  are  cultures  of  repetition .PERIOD they  circle  the  great  truths  again  and  again  and  again .PERIOD we  associate  repetition  with  boredom .PERIOD give  us  the  new ,COMMA we  're  always  saying .PERIOD the  new  is  better  than  the  old .PERIOD if  i  said  to  you ,COMMA okay ,COMMA we  're  not  going  to  have  new  ted .PERIOD we  're  just  going  to  run  through  all  the  old  ones  and  watch  them  five  times  because  they  're  so  true .PERIOD we  're  going  to  watch  elizabeth  gilbert  five  times  because  what  she  says  is  so  clever ,COMMA you'd  feel  cheated .PERIOD not  so  if  you  're  adopting  a  religious  mindset .PERIOD the  other  things  that  religions  do  is  to  arrange  time .PERIOD all  the  major  religions  give  us  calendars .PERIOD what  is  a  calendar ?QUESTIONMARK a  calendar  is  a  way  of  making  sure  that  across  the  year  you  will  bump  into  certain  very  important  ideas .PERIOD in  the  catholic  chronology ,COMMA catholic  calendar ,COMMA at  the  end  of  march  you  will  think  about  st .PERIOD jerome  and  his  qualities  of  humility  and  goodness  and  his  generosity  to  the  poor .PERIOD you  wo  n't  do  that  by  accident .PERIOD you  will  do  that  because  you  are  guided  to  do  that .PERIOD now  we  do  n't  think  that  way .PERIOD in  the  secular  world  we  think ,COMMA if  an  idea  is  important ,COMMA i  'll  bump  into  it .PERIOD i  'll  just  come  across  it  nonsense ,COMMA says  the  religious  world  view .PERIOD religious  view  says  we  need  calendars ,COMMA we  need  to  structure  time ,COMMA we  need  to  synchronize  encounters .PERIOD this  comes  across  also  in  the  way  in  which  religions  set  up  rituals  around  important  feelings .PERIOD take  the  moon .PERIOD it  's  really  important  to  look  at  the  moon .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA when  you  look  at  the  moon ,COMMA you  think ,COMMA i  'm  really  small .PERIOD what  are  my  problems  it  sets  things  into  perspective ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD we  should  all  look  at  the  moon  a  bit  more  often .PERIOD we  do  n't .PERIOD why  do  n't  we ?QUESTIONMARK well  there  's  nothing  to  tell  us ,COMMA look  at  the  moon  but  if  you  're  a  zen  buddhist  in  the  middle  of  september ,COMMA you  will  be  ordered  out  of  your  home ,COMMA made  to  stand  on  a  canonical  platform  and  made  to  celebrate  the  festival  of  tsukimi ,COMMA where  you  will  be  given  poems  to  read  in  honor  of  the  moon  and  the  passage  of  time  and  the  frailty  of  life  that  it  should  remind  us  of .PERIOD you  'll  be  handed  rice  cakes .PERIOD and  the  moon  and  the  reflection  on  the  moon  will  have  a  secure  place  in  your  heart .PERIOD that  's  very  good .PERIOD the  other  thing  that  religions  are  really  aware  of  is ,COMMA speak  well ,COMMA i  'm  not  doing  a  very  good  job  of  this  here ,COMMA but  oratory ,COMMA oratory  is  absolutely  key  to  religions .PERIOD in  the  secular  world ,COMMA you  can  come  through  the  university  system  and  be  a  lousy  speaker  and  still  have  a  great  career .PERIOD but  the  religious  world  does  n't  think  that  way .PERIOD what  you  're  saying  needs  to  be  backed  up  by  a  really  convincing  way  of  saying  it .PERIOD so  if  you  go  to  an  african  american  pentecostalist  church  in  the  american  south  and  you  listen  to  how  they  talk ,COMMA my  goodness ,COMMA they  talk  well .PERIOD after  every  convincing  point ,COMMA people  will  go ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen  at  the  end  of  a  really  rousing  paragraph ,COMMA they  'll  all  stand  up ,COMMA and  they  'll  go ,COMMA thank  you  jesus ,COMMA thank  you  christ ,COMMA thank  you  savior  if  we  were  doing  it  like  they  do  it ,COMMA let  's  not  do  it ,COMMA but  if  we  were  to  do  it ,COMMA i  would  tell  you  something  like ,COMMA culture  should  replace  scripture  and  you  would  go ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen ,COMMA amen  and  at  the  end  of  my  talk ,COMMA you  would  all  stand  up  and  you  would  go ,COMMA thank  you  plato ,COMMA thank  you  shakespeare ,COMMA thank  you  jane  austen  and  we'd  know  that  we  had  a  real  rhythm  going .PERIOD all  right ,COMMA all  right .PERIOD we  're  getting  there .PERIOD we  're  getting  there .PERIOD the  other  thing  that  religions  know  is  we  're  not  just  brains ,COMMA we  are  also  bodies .PERIOD and  when  they  teach  us  a  lesson ,COMMA they  do  it  via  the  body .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA take  the  jewish  idea  of  forgiveness .PERIOD jews  are  very  interested  in  forgiveness  and  how  we  should  start  anew  and  start  afresh .PERIOD they  do  n't  just  deliver  us  sermons  on  this .PERIOD they  do  n't  just  give  us  books  or  words  about  this .PERIOD they  tell  us  to  have  a  bath .PERIOD so  in  orthodox  jewish  communities ,COMMA every  friday  you  go  to  a  mikveh .PERIOD you  immerse  yourself  in  the  water ,COMMA and  a  physical  action  backs  up  a  philosophical  idea .PERIOD we  do  n't  tend  to  do  that .PERIOD our  ideas  are  in  one  area  and  our  behavior  with  our  bodies  is  in  another .PERIOD religions  are  fascinating  in  the  way  they  try  and  combine  the  two .PERIOD let  's  look  at  art  now .PERIOD now  art  is  something  that  in  the  secular  world ,COMMA we  think  very  highly  of .PERIOD we  think  art  is  really ,COMMA really  important .PERIOD a  lot  of  our  surplus  wealth  goes  to  museums ,COMMA etc .PERIOD we  sometimes  hear  it  said  that  museums  are  our  new  cathedrals ,COMMA or  our  new  churches .PERIOD you've  heard  that  saying .PERIOD now  i  think  that  the  potential  is  there .PERIOD but  we've  completely  let  ourselves  down .PERIOD and  the  reason  we've  let  ourselves  down  is  that  we  're  not  properly  studying  how  religions  handle  art .PERIOD the  two  really  bad  ideas  that  are  hovering  in  the  modern  world  that  inhibit  our  capacity  to  draw  strength  from  art ,COMMA the  first  idea  is  that  art  should  be  for  art  's  sake ,COMMA a  ridiculous  idea ,COMMA an  idea  that  art  should  live  in  a  hermetic  bubble  and  should  not  try  to  do  anything  with  this  troubled  world .PERIOD i  could  n't  disagree  more .PERIOD the  other  thing  that  we  believe  is  that  art  should  n't  explain  itself ,COMMA that  artists  should  n't  say  what  they  're  up  to ,COMMA because  if  they  said  it ,COMMA it  might  destroy  the  spell  and  we  might  find  it  too  easy .PERIOD that  's  why  a  very  common  feeling  when  you  're  in  a  museum ,COMMA let  's  admit  it ,COMMA is ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  what  this  is  about  but  if  we  're  serious  people ,COMMA we  do  n't  admit  to  that .PERIOD but  that  feeling  of  puzzlement  is  structural  to  contemporary  art .PERIOD now  religions  have  a  much  saner  attitude  to  art .PERIOD they  have  no  trouble  telling  us  what  art  is  about .PERIOD art  is  about  two  things  in  all  the  major  faiths .PERIOD firstly ,COMMA it  's  trying  to  remind  you  of  what  there  is  to  love .PERIOD and  secondly ,COMMA it  's  trying  to  remind  you  of  what  there  is  to  fear  and  to  hate .PERIOD and  that  's  what  art  is .PERIOD art  is  a  visceral  encounter  with  the  most  important  ideas  of  your  faith .PERIOD so  as  you  walk  around  a  church ,COMMA or  a  mosque  or  a  cathedral ,COMMA what  you  're  trying  to  imbibe ,COMMA what  you  're  imbibing  is ,COMMA through  your  eyes ,COMMA through  your  senses ,COMMA truths  that  have  otherwise  come  to  you  through  your  mind .PERIOD essentially  it  's  propaganda .PERIOD rembrandt  is  a  propagandist  in  the  christian  view .PERIOD now  the  word  propaganda  sets  off  alarm  bells .PERIOD we  think  of  hitler ,COMMA we  think  of  stalin .PERIOD do  n't ,COMMA necessarily .PERIOD propaganda  is  a  manner  of  being  didactic  in  honor  of  something .PERIOD and  if  that  thing  is  good ,COMMA there  's  no  problem  with  it  at  all .PERIOD my  view  is  that  museums  should  take  a  leaf  out  of  the  book  of  religions .PERIOD and  they  should  make  sure  that  when  you  walk  into  a  museum ,COMMA if  i  was  a  museum  curator ,COMMA i  would  make  a  room  for  love ,COMMA a  room  for  generosity .PERIOD all  works  of  art  are  talking  to  us  about  things .PERIOD and  if  we  were  able  to  arrange  spaces  where  we  could  come  across  works  where  we  would  be  told ,COMMA use  these  works  of  art  to  cement  these  ideas  in  your  mind ,COMMA we  would  get  a  lot  more  out  of  art .PERIOD art  would  pick  up  the  duty  that  it  used  to  have  and  that  we've  neglected  because  of  certain  mis-founded  ideas .PERIOD art  should  be  one  of  the  tools  by  which  we  improve  our  society .PERIOD art  should  be  didactic .PERIOD let  's  think  of  something  else .PERIOD the  people  in  the  modern  world ,COMMA in  the  secular  world ,COMMA who  are  interested  in  matters  of  the  spirit ,COMMA in  matters  of  the  mind ,COMMA in  higher  soul-like  concerns ,COMMA tend  to  be  isolated  individuals .PERIOD they  're  poets ,COMMA they  're  philosophers ,COMMA they  're  photographers ,COMMA they  're  filmmakers .PERIOD and  they  tend  to  be  on  their  own .PERIOD they  're  our  cottage  industries .PERIOD they  are  vulnerable ,COMMA single  people .PERIOD and  they  get  depressed  and  they  get  sad  on  their  own .PERIOD and  they  do  n't  really  change  much .PERIOD now  think  about  religions ,COMMA think  about  organized  religions .PERIOD what  do  organized  religions  do ?QUESTIONMARK they  group  together ,COMMA they  form  institutions .PERIOD and  that  has  all  sorts  of  advantages .PERIOD first  of  all ,COMMA scale ,COMMA might .PERIOD the  catholic  church  pulled  in  97  billion  dollars  last  year  according  to  the  wall  street  journal .PERIOD these  are  massive  machines .PERIOD they  're  collaborative ,COMMA they  're  branded ,COMMA they  're  multinational ,COMMA and  they  're  highly  disciplined .PERIOD these  are  all  very  good  qualities .PERIOD we  recognize  them  in  relation  to  corporations .PERIOD and  corporations  are  very  like  religions  in  many  ways ,COMMA except  they  're  right  down  at  the  bottom  of  the  pyramid  of  needs .PERIOD they  're  selling  us  shoes  and  cars .PERIOD whereas  the  people  who  are  selling  us  the  higher  stuff ,COMMA the  therapists ,COMMA the  poets ,COMMA are  on  their  own  and  they  have  no  power ,COMMA they  have  no  might .PERIOD so  religions  are  the  foremost  example  of  an  institution  that  is  fighting  for  the  things  of  the  mind .PERIOD now  we  may  not  agree  with  what  religions  are  trying  to  teach  us ,COMMA but  we  can  admire  the  institutional  way  in  which  they  're  doing  it .PERIOD books  alone ,COMMA books  written  by  lone  individuals ,COMMA are  not  going  to  change  anything .PERIOD we  need  to  group  together .PERIOD if  you  want  to  change  the  world ,COMMA you  have  to  group  together ,COMMA you  have  to  be  collaborative .PERIOD and  that  's  what  religions  do .PERIOD they  are  multinational ,COMMA as  i  say ,COMMA they  are  branded ,COMMA they  have  a  clear  identity ,COMMA so  they  do  n't  get  lost  in  a  busy  world .PERIOD that  's  something  we  can  learn  from .PERIOD i  want  to  conclude .PERIOD really  what  i  want  to  say  is  for  many  of  you  who  are  operating  in  a  range  of  different  fields ,COMMA there  is  something  to  learn  from  the  example  of  religion ,COMMA even  if  you  do  n't  believe  any  of  it .PERIOD if  you  're  involved  in  anything  that  's  communal ,COMMA that  involves  lots  of  people  getting  together ,COMMA there  are  things  for  you  in  religion .PERIOD if  you  're  involved ,COMMA say ,COMMA in  a  travel  industry  in  any  way ,COMMA look  at  pilgrimage .PERIOD look  very  closely  at  pilgrimage .PERIOD we  have  n't  begun  to  scratch  the  surface  of  what  travel  could  be  because  we  have  n't  looked  at  what  religions  do  with  travel .PERIOD if  you  're  in  the  art  world ,COMMA look  at  the  example  of  what  religions  are  doing  with  art .PERIOD and  if  you  're  an  educator  in  any  way ,COMMA again ,COMMA look  at  how  religions  are  spreading  ideas .PERIOD you  may  not  agree  with  the  ideas ,COMMA but  my  goodness ,COMMA they  're  highly  effective  mechanisms  for  doing  so .PERIOD so  really  my  concluding  point  is  you  may  not  agree  with  religion ,COMMA but  at  the  end  of  the  day ,COMMA religions  are  so  subtle ,COMMA so  complicated ,COMMA so  intelligent  in  many  ways  that  they  're  not  fit  to  be  abandoned  to  the  religious  alone .PERIOD they  're  for  all  of  us .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD chris  anderson ,COMMA now  this  is  actually  a  courageous  talk ,COMMA because  you  're  kind  of  setting  up  yourself  in  some  ways  to  be  ridiculed  in  some  quarters .PERIOD ab ,COMMA you  can  get  shot  by  both  sides .PERIOD you  can  get  shot  by  the  hard-headed  atheists ,COMMA and  you  can  get  shot  by  those  who  fully  believe .PERIOD ca ,COMMA incoming  missiles  from  north  oxford  at  any  moment .PERIOD ab ,COMMA indeed .PERIOD ca ,COMMA but  you  left  out  one  aspect  of  religion  that  a  lot  of  people  might  say  your  agenda  could  borrow  from ,COMMA which  is  this  sense ,COMMA that  's  actually  probably  the  most  important  thing  to  anyone  who  's  religious ,COMMA of  spiritual  experience ,COMMA of  some  kind  of  connection  with  something  that  's  bigger  than  you  are .PERIOD is  there  any  room  for  that  experience  in  atheism  20 ?QUESTIONMARK ab ,COMMA absolutely .PERIOD i ,COMMA like  many  of  you ,COMMA meet  people  who  say  things  like ,COMMA but  is  n't  there  something  bigger  than  us ,COMMA something  else  and  i  say ,COMMA of  course  and  they  say ,COMMA so  are  n't  you  sort  of  religious  and  i  go ,COMMA no  why  does  that  sense  of  mystery ,COMMA that  sense  of  the  dizzying  scale  of  the  universe ,COMMA need  to  be  accompanied  by  a  mystical  feeling ?QUESTIONMARK science  and  just  observation  gives  us  that  feeling  without  it ,COMMA so  i  do  n't  feel  the  need .PERIOD the  universe  is  large  and  we  are  tiny ,COMMA without  the  need  for  further  religious  superstructure .PERIOD so  one  can  have  so-called  spiritual  moments  without  belief  in  the  spirit .PERIOD ca ,COMMA actually ,COMMA let  me  just  ask  a  question .PERIOD how  many  people  here  would  say  that  religion  is  important  to  them ?QUESTIONMARK is  there  an  equivalent  process  by  which  there  's  a  sort  of  bridge  between  what  you  're  talking  about  and  what  you  would  say  to  them ?QUESTIONMARK ab ,COMMA i  would  say  that  there  are  many ,COMMA many  gaps  in  secular  life  and  these  can  be  plugged .PERIOD it  's  not  as  though ,COMMA as  i  try  to  suggest ,COMMA it  's  not  as  though  either  you  have  religion  and  then  you  have  to  accept  all  sorts  of  things ,COMMA or  you  do  n't  have  religion  and  then  you  're  cut  off  from  all  these  very  good  things .PERIOD it  's  so  sad  that  we  constantly  say ,COMMA i  do  n't  believe  so  i  cannot  have  community ,COMMA so  i  'm  cut  off  from  morality ,COMMA so  i  cannot  go  on  a  pilgrimage  one  wants  to  say ,COMMA nonsense .PERIOD why  not  and  that  's  really  the  spirit  of  my  talk .PERIOD there  's  so  much  we  can  absorb .PERIOD atheism  should  n't  cut  itself  off  from  the  rich  sources  of  religion .PERIOD ca ,COMMA it  seems  to  me  that  there  's  plenty  of  people  in  the  ted  community  who  are  atheists .PERIOD but  probably  most  people  in  the  community  certainly  do  n't  think  that  religion  is  going  away  any  time  soon  and  want  to  find  the  language  to  have  a  constructive  dialogue  and  to  feel  like  we  can  actually  talk  to  each  other  and  at  least  share  some  things  in  common .PERIOD are  we  foolish  to  be  optimistic  about  the  possibility  of  a  world  where ,COMMA instead  of  religion  being  the  great  rallying  cry  of  divide  and  war ,COMMA that  there  could  be  bridging ?QUESTIONMARK ab ,COMMA no ,COMMA we  need  to  be  polite  about  differences .PERIOD politeness  is  a  much-overlooked  virtue .PERIOD it  's  seen  as  hypocrisy .PERIOD but  we  need  to  get  to  a  stage  when  you  're  an  atheist  and  someone  says ,COMMA well  you  know ,COMMA i  did  pray  the  other  day ,COMMA you  politely  ignore  it .PERIOD you  move  on .PERIOD because  you've  agreed  on  90  percent  of  things ,COMMA because  you  have  a  shared  view  on  so  many  things ,COMMA and  you  politely  differ .PERIOD and  i  think  that  's  what  the  religious  wars  of  late  have  ignored .PERIOD they've  ignored  the  possibility  of  harmonious  disagreement .PERIOD ca ,COMMA and  finally ,COMMA does  this  new  thing  that  you  're  proposing  that  's  not  a  religion  but  something  else ,COMMA does  it  need  a  leader ,COMMA and  are  you  volunteering  to  be  the  pope ?QUESTIONMARK ab ,COMMA well ,COMMA one  thing  that  we  're  all  very  suspicious  of  is  individual  leaders .PERIOD it  does  n't  need  it .PERIOD what  i've  tried  to  lay  out  is  a  framework  and  i  'm  hoping  that  people  can  just  fill  it  in .PERIOD i've  sketched  a  sort  of  broad  framework .PERIOD but  wherever  you  are ,COMMA as  i  say ,COMMA if  you  're  in  the  travel  industry ,COMMA do  that  travel  bit .PERIOD if  you  're  in  the  communal  industry ,COMMA look  at  religion  and  do  the  communal  bit .PERIOD so  it  's  a  wiki  project .PERIOD ca ,COMMA alain ,COMMA thank  you  for  sparking  many  conversations  later .PERIOD sometimes  i  go  browsing  through  a  very  old  magazine .PERIOD i  found  this  observation  test  about  the  story  of  the  ark .PERIOD and  the  artist  that  drew  this  observation  test  did  some  errors ,COMMA had  some  mistakes  -- .PERIOD there  are  more  or  less  12  mistakes .PERIOD some  of  them  are  very  easy .PERIOD there  is  a  funnel ,COMMA an  aerial  part ,COMMA a  lamp  and  clockwork  key  on  the  ark .PERIOD some  of  them  are  about  the  animals ,COMMA the  number .PERIOD but  there  is  a  much  more  fundamental  mistake  in  the  overall  story  of  the  ark  that  's  not  reported  here .PERIOD and  this  problem  is ,COMMA where  are  the  plants ?QUESTIONMARK so  now  we  have  god  that  is  going  to  submerge  earth  permanently  or  at  least  for  a  very  long  period ,COMMA and  no  one  is  taking  care  of  plants .PERIOD noah  needed  to  take  two  of  every  kind  of  bird ,COMMA of  every  kind  of  animal ,COMMA of  every  kind  of  creature  that  moves ,COMMA but  no  mention  about  plants .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK in  another  part  of  the  same  story ,COMMA all  the  living  creatures  are  just  the  living  creatures  that  came  out  from  the  ark ,COMMA so  birds ,COMMA livestock  and  wild  animals .PERIOD plants  are  not  living  creatures  -- .PERIOD this  is  the  point .PERIOD that  is  a  point  that  is  not  coming  out  from  the  bible ,COMMA but  it  's  something  that  really  accompanied  humanity .PERIOD let  's  have  a  look  at  this  nice  code  that  is  coming  from  a  renaissance  book .PERIOD here  we  have  the  description  of  the  order  of  nature .PERIOD it  's  a  nice  description  because  it  's  starting  from  left ,COMMA you  have  the  stones ,COMMA immediately  after  the  stones ,COMMA the  plants  that  are  just  able  to  live .PERIOD we  have  the  animals  that  are  able  to  live  and  to  sense ,COMMA and  on  the  top  of  the  pyramid ,COMMA there  is  the  man .PERIOD this  is  not  the  common  man .PERIOD the  homo  studiosus ,COMMA the  studying  man .PERIOD this  is  quite  comforting  for  people  like  me ,COMMA i  'm  a  professor ,COMMA this  to  be  over  there  on  the  top  of  creation .PERIOD but  it  's  something  completely  wrong .PERIOD you  know  very  well  about  professors .PERIOD but  it  's  also  wrong  about  plants ,COMMA because  plants  are  not  just  able  to  live .PERIOD they  are  able  to  sense .PERIOD they  are  much  more  sophisticated  in  sensing  than  animals .PERIOD just  to  give  you  an  example ,COMMA every  single  root  apex  is  able  to  detect  and  to  monitor  concurrently  and  continuously  at  least  15  different  chemical  and  physical  parameters .PERIOD and  they  also  are  able  to  show  and  to  exhibit  such  a  wonderful  and  complex  behavior  that  can  be  described  just  with  the  term  of  intelligence .PERIOD well ,COMMA but  this  is  something ,COMMA this  underestimation  of  plants  is  something  that  is  always  with  us .PERIOD let  's  have  a  look  at  this  short  movie  now .PERIOD we  have  david  attenborough .PERIOD now  david  attenborough  is  really  a  plant  lover .PERIOD he  did  some  of  the  most  beautiful  movies  about  plant  behavior .PERIOD now ,COMMA when  he  speaks  about  plants ,COMMA everything  is  correct .PERIOD when  he  speaks  about  animals ,COMMA he  tends  to  remove  the  fact  that  plants  exist .PERIOD the  blue  whale ,COMMA the  biggest  creature  that  exists  on  the  planet  -- .PERIOD that  is  wrong ,COMMA completely  wrong .PERIOD the  blue  whale ,COMMA it  's  a  dwarf  if  compared  with  the  real  biggest  creature  that  exists  on  the  planet ,COMMA that  is ,COMMA this  wonderful ,COMMA magnificent  sequoiadendron  giganteum .PERIOD and  this  is  a  living  organism  that  has  a  mass  of  at  least  2,000  tons .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  story  that  plants  are  some  low-level  organisms  has  been  formalized  many  times  ago  by  aristotle ,COMMA that  in  de  anima ,COMMA that  is  a  very  influential  book  for  the  western  civilization ,COMMA wrote  that  the  plants  are  on  the  edge  between  living  and  not  living .PERIOD they  have  just  a  kind  of  very  low-level  soul .PERIOD it  's  called  the  vegetative  soul ,COMMA because  they  lack  movement ,COMMA and  so  they  do  n't  need  to  sense .PERIOD let  's  see .PERIOD okay ,COMMA some  of  the  movements  of  the  plants  are  very  well-known .PERIOD this  is  a  very  fast  movement .PERIOD this  is  a  dionaea ,COMMA a  venus  fly  trap  hunting  snails  -- .PERIOD sorry  for  the  snail .PERIOD this  has  been  something  that  has  been  refused  for  centuries ,COMMA despite  the  evidence .PERIOD no  one  can  say  that  the  plants  were  able  to  eat  an  animal ,COMMA because  it  was  against  the  order  of  nature .PERIOD but  plants  are  also  able  to  show  a  lot  of  movement .PERIOD some  of  them  are  very  well  known ,COMMA like  the  flowering .PERIOD it  's  just  a  question  to  use  some  techniques  like  the  time  lapse .PERIOD some  of  them  are  much  more  sophisticated .PERIOD look  at  this  young  bean  that  is  moving  to  catch  the  light  every  time .PERIOD and  it  's  really  so  graceful .PERIOD it  's  like  a  dancing  angel .PERIOD they  are  also  able  to  play  -- .PERIOD they  are  really  playing .PERIOD these  are  young  sunflowers ,COMMA and  what  they  are  doing  cannot  be  described  with  any  other  terms  than  playing .PERIOD they  are  training  themselves ,COMMA as  many  young  animals  do ,COMMA to  the  adult  life  where  they  will  be  called  to  track  the  sun  all  the  day .PERIOD they  are  able  to  respond  to  gravity ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA so  the  shoots  are  growing  against  the  vector  of  gravity  and  the  roots  toward  the  vector  of  gravity .PERIOD but  they  are  also  able  to  sleep .PERIOD this  is  one ,COMMA mimosa  pudica .PERIOD so  during  the  night ,COMMA they  curl  the  leaves  and  reduce  the  movement ,COMMA and  during  the  day ,COMMA you  have  the  opening  of  the  leaves ,COMMA there  is  much  more  movement .PERIOD this  is  interesting  because  this  sleeping  machinery ,COMMA it  's  perfectly  conserved .PERIOD it  's  the  same  in  plants ,COMMA in  insects  and  in  animals .PERIOD and  so  if  you  need  to  study  this  sleeping  problem ,COMMA it  's  easy  to  study  on  plants ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA than  in  animals  and  it  's  much  more  easy  even  ethically .PERIOD it  's  a  kind  of  vegetarian  experimentation .PERIOD plants  are  even  able  to  communicate  -- .PERIOD they  are  extraordinary  communicators .PERIOD they  communicate  with  other  plants .PERIOD they  are  able  to  distinguish  kin  and  non-kin .PERIOD they  communicate  with  plants  of  other  species  and  they  communicate  with  animals  by  producing  chemical  volatiles ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA during  the  pollination .PERIOD now  with  the  pollination ,COMMA it  's  a  very  serious  issue  for  plants ,COMMA because  they  move  the  pollen  from  one  flower  to  the  other ,COMMA yet  they  cannot  move  from  one  flower  to  the  other .PERIOD so  they  need  a  vector ,COMMA and  this  vector ,COMMA it  's  normally  an  animal .PERIOD many  insects  have  been  used  by  plants  as  vectors  for  the  transport  of  the  pollination ,COMMA but  not  just  insects .PERIOD even  birds ,COMMA reptiles ,COMMA and  mammals  like  bats  rats  are  normally  used  for  the  transportation  of  the  pollen .PERIOD this  is  a  serious  business .PERIOD we  have  the  plants  that  are  giving  to  the  animals  a  kind  of  sweet  substance ,COMMA very  energizing ,COMMA having  in  change  this  transportation  of  the  pollen .PERIOD but  some  plants  are  manipulating  animals ,COMMA like  in  the  case  of  orchids  that  promise  sex  and  nectar  and  give  in  change  nothing  for  the  transportation  of  the  pollen .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  is  a  big  problem  behind  all  this  behavior  that  we  have  seen .PERIOD how  is  it  possible  to  do  this  without  a  brain ?QUESTIONMARK we  need  to  wait  until  1880 ,COMMA when  this  big  man ,COMMA charles  darwin ,COMMA publishes  a  wonderful ,COMMA astonishing  book  that  starts  a  revolution .PERIOD the  title  is  the  power  of  movement  in  plants .PERIOD no  one  was  allowed  to  speak  about  movement  in  plants  before  charles  darwin .PERIOD in  his  book ,COMMA assisted  by  his  son ,COMMA francis ,COMMA who  was  the  first  professor  of  plant  physiology  in  the  world ,COMMA in  cambridge ,COMMA they  took  into  consideration  every  single  movement  for  500  pages .PERIOD and  in  the  last  paragraph  of  the  book ,COMMA it  's  a  kind  of  stylistic  mark ,COMMA because  normally  charles  darwin  stored ,COMMA in  the  last  paragraph  of  a  book ,COMMA the  most  important  message .PERIOD he  wrote  that ,COMMA it  's  hardly  an  exaggeration  to  say  that  the  tip  of  the  radical  acts  like  the  brain  of  one  of  the  lower  animals .PERIOD this  is  not  a  metaphor .PERIOD he  wrote  some  very  interesting  letters  to  one  of  his  friends  who  was  jd .PERIOD hooker ,COMMA or  at  that  time ,COMMA president  of  the  royal  society ,COMMA so  the  maximum  scientific  authority  in  britain  speaking  about  the  brain  in  the  plants .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  is  a  root  apex  growing  against  a  slope .PERIOD so  you  can  recognize  this  kind  of  movement ,COMMA the  same  movement  that  worms ,COMMA snakes  and  every  animal  that  are  moving  on  the  ground  without  legs  is  able  to  display .PERIOD and  it  's  not  an  easy  movement  because ,COMMA to  have  this  kind  of  movement ,COMMA you  need  to  move  different  regions  of  the  root  and  to  synchronize  these  different  regions  without  having  a  brain .PERIOD so  we  studied  the  root  apex  and  we  found  that  there  is  a  specific  region  that  is  here ,COMMA depicted  in  blue ,COMMA that  is  called  the  transition  zone .PERIOD and  this  region ,COMMA it  's  a  very  small  region  -- .PERIOD it  's  less  than  one  millimeter .PERIOD and  in  this  small  region  you  have  the  highest  consumption  of  oxygen  in  the  plants  and  more  important ,COMMA you  have  these  kinds  of  signals  here .PERIOD the  signals  that  you  are  seeing  here  are  action  potential ,COMMA are  the  same  signals  that  the  neurons  of  my  brain ,COMMA of  our  brain ,COMMA use  to  exchange  information .PERIOD now  we  know  that  a  root  apex  has  just  a  few  hundred  cells  that  show  this  kind  of  feature ,COMMA but  we  know  how  big  the  root  apparatus  of  a  small  plant ,COMMA like  a  plant  of  rye .PERIOD we  have  almost  14  million  roots .PERIOD we  have  11  and  a  half  million  root  apex  and  a  total  length  of  600  or  more  kilometers  and  a  very  high  surface  area .PERIOD now  let  's  imagine  that  each  single  root  apex  is  working  in  network  with  all  the  others .PERIOD here  were  have  on  the  left ,COMMA the  internet  and  on  the  right ,COMMA the  root  apparatus .PERIOD they  work  in  the  same  way .PERIOD they  are  a  network  of  small  computing  machines ,COMMA working  in  networks .PERIOD and  why  are  they  so  similar ?QUESTIONMARK because  they  evolved  for  the  same  reason ,COMMA to  survive  predation .PERIOD they  work  in  the  same  way .PERIOD so  you  can  remove  90  percent  of  the  root  apparatus  and  the  plants  continue  to  work .PERIOD you  can  remove  90  percent  of  the  internet  and  it  is  continuing  to  work .PERIOD so ,COMMA a  suggestion  for  the  people  working  with  networks ,COMMA plants  are  able  to  give  you  good  suggestions  about  how  to  evolve  networks .PERIOD and  another  possibility  is  a  technological  possibility .PERIOD let  's  imagine  that  we  can  build  robots  and  robots  that  are  inspired  by  plants .PERIOD until  now ,COMMA the  man  was  inspired  just  by  man  or  the  animals  in  producing  a  robot .PERIOD we  have  the  animaloid ,COMMA and  the  normal  robots  inspired  by  animals ,COMMA insectoid ,COMMA so  on .PERIOD we  have  the  androids  that  are  inspired  by  man .PERIOD but  why  have  we  not  any  plantoid ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA if  you  want  to  fly ,COMMA it  's  good  that  you  look  at  birds ,COMMA to  be  inspired  by  birds .PERIOD but  if  you  want  to  explore  soils ,COMMA or  if  you  want  to  colonize  new  territory ,COMMA to  best  thing  that  you  can  do  is  to  be  inspired  by  plants  that  are  masters  in  doing  this .PERIOD we  have  another  possibility  we  are  working  on  in  our  lab ,COMMA which  is  to  build  hybrids .PERIOD it  's  much  more  easy  to  build  hybrids .PERIOD hybrid  means  it  's  something  that  's  half  living  and  half  machine .PERIOD it  's  much  more  easy  to  work  with  plants  than  with  animals .PERIOD they  have  computing  power .PERIOD they  have  electrical  signals .PERIOD the  connection  with  the  machine  is  much  more  easy ,COMMA much  more  even  ethically  possible .PERIOD and  these  are  three  possibilities  that  we  are  working  on  to  build  hybrids ,COMMA driven  by  algae  or  by  the  leaves  at  the  end ,COMMA by  the  most ,COMMA most  powerful  parts  of  the  plants ,COMMA by  the  roots .PERIOD well ,COMMA thank  you  for  your  attention .PERIOD and  before  i  finish ,COMMA i  would  like  to  reassure  that  no  snails  were  harmed  in  making  this  presentation .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD /transcript .PERIOD the  story  i  wanted  to  share  with  you  today  is  my  challenge  as  an  iranian  artist ,COMMA as  an  iranian  woman  artist ,COMMA as  an  iranian  woman  artist  living  in  exile .PERIOD well ,COMMA it  has  its  pluses  and  minuses .PERIOD on  the  dark  side ,COMMA politics  does  n't  seem  to  escape  people  like  me .PERIOD every  iranian  artist ,COMMA in  one  form  or  another ,COMMA is  political .PERIOD politics  have  defined  our  lives .PERIOD if  you  're  living  in  iran ,COMMA you  're  facing  censorship ,COMMA harassment ,COMMA arrest ,COMMA torture ,COMMA at  times ,COMMA execution .PERIOD if  you  're  living  outside  like  me ,COMMA you  're  faced  with  life  in  exile ,COMMA the  pain  of  the  longing  and  the  separation  from  your  loved  ones  and  your  family .PERIOD therefore ,COMMA we  do  n't  find  the  moral ,COMMA emotional ,COMMA psychological  and  political  space  to  distance  ourselves  from  the  reality  of  social  responsibility .PERIOD oddly  enough ,COMMA an  artist  such  as  myself  finds  herself  also  in  the  position  of  being  the  voice ,COMMA the  speaker  of  my  people ,COMMA even  if  i  have ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA no  access  to  my  own  country .PERIOD also ,COMMA people  like  myself ,COMMA we  're  fighting  two  battles  on  different  grounds .PERIOD we  're  being  critical  of  the  west ,COMMA the  perception  of  the  west  about  our  identity ,COMMA about  the  image  that  is  constructed  about  us ,COMMA about  our  women ,COMMA about  our  politics ,COMMA about  our  religion .PERIOD we  are  there  to  take  pride  and  insist  on  respect .PERIOD and  at  the  same  time ,COMMA we  're  fighting  another  battle .PERIOD that  is  our  regime ,COMMA our  government ,COMMA our  atrocious  government ,COMMA that  has  done  every  crime  in  order  to  stay  in  power .PERIOD our  artists  are  at  risk .PERIOD we  are  in  a  position  of  danger .PERIOD we  pose  a  threat  to  the  order  of  the  government .PERIOD but  ironically ,COMMA this  situation  has  empowered  all  of  us ,COMMA because  we  are  considered ,COMMA as  artists ,COMMA central  to  the  cultural ,COMMA political ,COMMA social  discourse  in  iran .PERIOD we  are  there  to  inspire ,COMMA to  provoke ,COMMA to  mobilize ,COMMA to  bring  hope  to  our  people .PERIOD we  are  the  reporters  of  our  people ,COMMA and  are  communicators  to  the  outside  world .PERIOD art  is  our  weapon .PERIOD culture  is  a  form  of  resistance .PERIOD i  envy  sometimes  the  artists  of  the  west  for  their  freedom  of  expression .PERIOD for  the  fact  that  they  can  distance  themselves  from  the  question  of  politics .PERIOD from  the  fact  that  they  are  only  serving  one  audience ,COMMA mainly  the  western  culture .PERIOD but  also ,COMMA i  worry  about  the  west ,COMMA because  often  in  this  country ,COMMA in  this  western  world  that  we  have ,COMMA culture  risks  being  a  form  of  entertainment .PERIOD our  people  depend  on  our  artists ,COMMA and  culture  is  beyond  communication .PERIOD my  journey  as  an  artist  started  from  a  very ,COMMA very  personal  place .PERIOD i  did  not  start  to  make  social  commentary  about  my  country .PERIOD the  first  one  that  you  see  in  front  of  you  is  actually  when  i  first  returned  to  iran  after  being  separated  for  a  good  12  years .PERIOD it  was  after  the  islamic  revolution  of  1979 .PERIOD while  i  was  absent  from  iran ,COMMA the  islamic  revolution  had  descended  on  iran  and  had  entirely  transformed  the  country  from  persian  to  the  islamic  culture .PERIOD i  came  mainly  to  be  reunited  with  my  family  and  to  reconnect  in  a  way  that  i  found  my  place  in  the  society .PERIOD but  instead ,COMMA i  found  a  country  that  was  totally  ideological  and  that  i  did  n't  recognize  anymore .PERIOD more  so ,COMMA i  became  very  interested ,COMMA as  i  was  facing  my  own  personal  dilemmas  and  questions ,COMMA i  became  immersed  in  the  study  of  the  islamic  revolution ,COMMA how ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA it  had  incredibly  transformed  the  lives  of  iranian  women .PERIOD i  found  the  subject  of  iranian  women  immensely  interesting ,COMMA in  the  way  the  women  of  iran ,COMMA historically ,COMMA seemed  to  embody  the  political  transformation .PERIOD so  in  a  way ,COMMA by  studying  a  woman ,COMMA you  can  read  the  structure  and  the  ideology  of  the  country .PERIOD so  i  made  a  group  of  work  that  at  once  faced  my  own  personal  questions  in  life ,COMMA and  yet  it  brought  my  work  into  a  larger  discourse ,COMMA the  subject  of  martyrdom ,COMMA the  question  of  those  who  willingly  stand  in  that  intersection  of  love  of  god ,COMMA faith ,COMMA but  violence  and  crime  and  cruelty .PERIOD for  me ,COMMA this  became  incredibly  important .PERIOD and  yet ,COMMA i  had  an  unusual  position  toward  this .PERIOD i  was  an  outsider  who  had  come  back  to  iran  to  find  my  place ,COMMA but  i  was  not  in  a  position  to  be  critical  of  the  government  or  the  ideology  of  the  islamic  revolution .PERIOD this  changed  slowly  as  i  found  my  voice  and  i  discovered  things  that  i  did  n't  know  i  would  discover .PERIOD so  my  art  became  slightly  more  critical .PERIOD my  knife  became  a  little  sharper .PERIOD and  i  fell  into  a  life  in  exile .PERIOD i  am  a  nomadic  artist .PERIOD i  work  in  morocco ,COMMA in  turkey ,COMMA in  mexico .PERIOD i  go  everywhere  to  make  believe  it  's  iran .PERIOD now  i  am  making  films .PERIOD last  year ,COMMA i  finished  a  film  called  women  without  men .PERIOD women  without  men  returns  to  history ,COMMA but  another  part  of  our  iranian  history .PERIOD it  goes  to  1953  when  american  cia  exercised  a  coup  and  removed  a  democratically  elected  leader ,COMMA dr.  mossadegh .PERIOD the  book  is  written  by  an  iranian  woman ,COMMA shahrnush  parsipur .PERIOD it  's  a  magical  realist  novel .PERIOD this  book  is  banned ,COMMA and  she  spent  five  years  in  prison .PERIOD my  obsession  with  this  book ,COMMA and  the  reason  i  made  this  into  a  film ,COMMA is  because  it  at  once  was  addressing  the  question  of  being  a  female ,COMMA traditionally ,COMMA historically  in  iran ,COMMA and  the  question  of  four  women  who  are  all  looking  for  an  idea  of  change ,COMMA freedom  and  democracy ,COMMA while  the  country  of  iran ,COMMA equally ,COMMA as  if  another  character ,COMMA also  struggled  for  an  idea  of  freedom  and  democracy  and  independence  from  the  foreign  interventions .PERIOD i  made  this  film  because  i  felt  it  's  important  for  it  to  speak  to  the  westerners  about  our  history  as  a  country .PERIOD that  all  of  you  seem  to  remember  iran  after  the  islamic  revolution .PERIOD that  iran  was  once  a  secular  society ,COMMA and  we  had  democracy ,COMMA and  this  democracy  was  stolen  from  us  by  the  american  government ,COMMA by  the  british  government .PERIOD this  film  also  speaks  to  the  iranian  people  in  asking  them  to  return  to  their  history  and  look  at  themselves  before  they  were  so  islamicized ,COMMA in  the  way  we  looked ,COMMA in  the  way  we  played  music ,COMMA in  the  way  we  had  intellectual  life .PERIOD and  most  of  all ,COMMA in  the  way  that  we  fought  for  democracy .PERIOD these  are  some  of  the  shots  actually  from  my  film .PERIOD these  are  some  of  the  images  of  the  coup .PERIOD and  we  made  this  film  in  casablanca ,COMMA recreating  all  the  shots .PERIOD this  film  tried  to  find  a  balance  between  telling  a  political  story ,COMMA but  also  a  feminine  story .PERIOD being  a  visual  artist ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA i  am  foremost  interested  to  make  art ,COMMA to  make  art  that  transcends  politics ,COMMA religion ,COMMA the  question  of  feminism ,COMMA and  become  an  important ,COMMA timeless ,COMMA universal  work  of  art .PERIOD the  challenge  i  have  is  how  to  do  that .PERIOD how  to  tell  a  political  story  but  an  allegorical  story .PERIOD how  to  move  you  with  your  emotions ,COMMA but  also  make  your  mind  work .PERIOD these  are  some  of  the  images  and  the  characters  of  the  film .PERIOD now  comes  the  green  movement ,COMMA the  summer  of  2009 ,COMMA as  my  film  is  released ,COMMA the  uprising  begins  in  the  streets  of  tehran .PERIOD what  is  unbelievably  ironic  is  the  period  that  we  tried  to  depict  in  the  film ,COMMA the  cry  for  democracy  and  social  justice ,COMMA repeats  itself  now  again  in  tehran .PERIOD the  green  movement  significantly  inspired  the  world .PERIOD it  brought  a  lot  of  attention  to  all  those  iranians  who  stand  for  basic  human  rights  and  struggle  for  democracy .PERIOD what  was  most  significant  for  me  was ,COMMA once  again ,COMMA the  presence  of  the  women .PERIOD they  're  absolutely  inspirational  for  me .PERIOD if  in  the  islamic  revolution ,COMMA the  images  of  the  woman  portrayed  were  submissive  and  did  n't  have  a  voice ,COMMA now  we  saw  a  new  idea  of  feminism  in  the  streets  of  tehran ,COMMA women  who  were  educated ,COMMA forward  thinking ,COMMA non-traditional ,COMMA sexually  open ,COMMA fearless  and  seriously  feminist .PERIOD these  women  and  those  young  men  united  iranians  across  the  world ,COMMA inside  and  outside .PERIOD i  then  discovered  why  i  take  so  much  inspiration  from  iranian  women .PERIOD that ,COMMA under  all  circumstances ,COMMA they  have  pushed  the  boundary .PERIOD they  have  confronted  the  authority .PERIOD they  have  broken  every  rule  in  the  smallest  and  the  biggest  way .PERIOD and  once  again ,COMMA they  proved  themselves .PERIOD i  stand  here  to  say  that  iranian  women  have  found  a  new  voice ,COMMA and  their  voice  is  giving  me  my  voice .PERIOD and  it  's  a  great  honor  to  be  an  iranian  woman  and  an  iranian  artist ,COMMA even  if  i  have  to  operate  in  the  west  only  for  now .PERIOD thank  you  so  much .PERIOD so  i  want  to  tell  you  a  story ,COMMA an  encouraging  story ,COMMA about  addressing  desperation ,COMMA depression  and  despair  in  afghanistan ,COMMA and  what  we  have  learned  from  it ,COMMA and  how  to  help  people  to  overcome  traumatic  experiences  and  how  to  help  them  to  regain  some  confidence  in  the  time  ahead ,COMMA in  the  future ,COMMA and  how  to  participate  again  in  everyday  life .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  am  a  jungian  psychoanalyst ,COMMA and  i  went  to  afghanistan  in  january  2004 ,COMMA by  chance ,COMMA on  an  assignment  for  medica  mondiale .PERIOD jung  in  afghanistan ,COMMA you  get  the  picture .PERIOD afghanistan  is  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world ,COMMA and  70  percent  of  the  people  are  illiterate .PERIOD war  and  malnutrition  kills  people  together  with  hope .PERIOD you  may  know  this  from  the  media .PERIOD but  what  you  may  not  know  is  that  the  average  age  of  the  afghan  people  is  17  years  old ,COMMA which  means  they  grow  up  in  such  an  environment  and ,COMMA i  repeat  myself ,COMMA in  30  years  of  war .PERIOD so  this  translates  into  ongoing  violence ,COMMA foreign  interests ,COMMA bribery ,COMMA drugs ,COMMA ethnic  conflicts ,COMMA bad  health ,COMMA shame ,COMMA fear  and  cumulative  traumatic  experiences .PERIOD local  and  foreign  military  are  supposed  to  build  peace  together  with  the  donors  and  the  governmental  and  non-governmental  organizations .PERIOD and  people  had  hope ,COMMA yes ,COMMA but  until  they  realized  their  situation  worsens  every  day ,COMMA either  because  they  are  being  killed  or  because ,COMMA somehow ,COMMA they  are  poorer  than  eight  years  ago .PERIOD one  figure  for  that ,COMMA 54  percent  of  the  children  under  the  age  of  five  years  suffer  from  malnutrition .PERIOD yet ,COMMA there  is  hope .PERIOD one  day  a  man  told  me ,COMMA my  future  does  not  look  brilliant ,COMMA but  i  want  to  have  a  brilliant  future  for  my  son .PERIOD this  is  a  picture  i  took  in  2005 ,COMMA walking  on  fridays  over  the  hills  in  kabul .PERIOD and  for  me  it  's  a  symbolic  picture  of  an  open  future  for  a  young  generation .PERIOD so ,COMMA doctors  prescribe  medication .PERIOD and  donors  are  supposed  to  bring  peace  by  building  schools  and  roads .PERIOD military  collect  weapons ,COMMA and  depression  stays  intact .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK because  people  do  n't  have  tools  to  cope  with  it ,COMMA to  get  over  it .PERIOD so ,COMMA soon  after  my  arrival ,COMMA i  had  confirmed  something  which  i  had  already  known .PERIOD that  my  instruments  come  from  the  heart  of  modern  europe ,COMMA yes .PERIOD however ,COMMA what  can  wound  us  and  our  reaction  to  those  wounds ,COMMA they  are  universal .PERIOD and  the  big  challenge  was  how  to  understand  the  meaning  of  the  symptom  in  this  specific  cultural  context .PERIOD after  a  counseling  session ,COMMA a  woman  said  to  me ,COMMA because  you  have  felt  me ,COMMA i  can  feel  myself  again ,COMMA and  i  want  to  participate  again  in  my  family  life .PERIOD this  was  very  important ,COMMA because  the  family  is  central  in  afghans  social  system .PERIOD no  one  can  survive  alone .PERIOD and  if  people  feel  used ,COMMA worthless  and  ashamed ,COMMA because  something  horrible  has  happened  to  them ,COMMA then  they  retreat ,COMMA and  they  fall  into  social  isolation ,COMMA and  they  do  not  dare  to  tell  this  evil  to  other  people  or  to  their  loved  ones ,COMMA because  they  do  not  want  to  burden  them .PERIOD and  very  often  violence  is  a  way  to  cope  with  it .PERIOD traumatized  people  also  easily  lose  control ,COMMA symptoms  are  hyper-arousal  and  memory  flashbacks ,COMMA so  people  are  in  a  constant  fear  that  those  horrible  feelings  of  that  traumatic  event  might  come  back  unexpectedly ,COMMA suddenly ,COMMA and  they  cannot  control  it .PERIOD to  compensate  this  loss  of  inner  control ,COMMA they  try  to  control  the  outside ,COMMA very  understandably ,COMMA mostly  the  family ,COMMA and  unfortunately ,COMMA this  fits  very  well  into  the  traditional  side ,COMMA regressive  side ,COMMA repressive  side ,COMMA restrictive  side  of  the  cultural  context .PERIOD so ,COMMA husbands  start  beating  wives ,COMMA mothers  and  fathers  beat  their  children ,COMMA and  afterward ,COMMA they  feel  awful .PERIOD they  did  not  want  to  do  this ,COMMA it  just  happened  -- .PERIOD they  lost  control .PERIOD the  desperate  try  to  restore  order  and  normality ,COMMA and  if  we  are  not  able  to  cut  this  circle  of  violence ,COMMA it  will  be  transferred  to  the  next  generation  without  a  doubt .PERIOD and  partly  this  is  already  happening .PERIOD so  everybody  needs  a  sense  for  the  future .PERIOD and  the  afghan  sense  of  the  future  is  shattered .PERIOD but  let  me  repeat  the  words  of  the  woman .PERIOD because  you  have  felt  me ,COMMA i  can  feel  myself  again .PERIOD so  the  key  here  is  empathy .PERIOD somebody  has  to  be  a  witness  to  what  has  happened  to  you .PERIOD somebody  has  to  feel  how  you  felt .PERIOD and  somebody  has  to  see  you  and  listen  to  you .PERIOD everybody  must  be  able  to  know  what  he  or  she  has  experienced  is  true .PERIOD and  this  only  goes  with  another  person .PERIOD so  everybody  must  be  able  to  say ,COMMA this  happened  to  me ,COMMA and  it  did  this  with  me ,COMMA but  i  'm  able  to  live  with  it ,COMMA to  cope  with  it ,COMMA and  to  learn  from  it .PERIOD and  i  want  to  engage  myself  in  the  bright  future  for  my  children  and  the  children  of  my  children ,COMMA and  i  will  not  marry-off  my  13  year-old  daughter, ,COMMA what  happens  too  often  in  afghanistan .PERIOD so  something  can  be  done ,COMMA even  in  such  extreme  environments  as  afghanistan .PERIOD and  i  started  thinking  about  a  counseling  program .PERIOD but ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA i  needed  help  and  funds .PERIOD and  one  evening ,COMMA i  was  sitting  next  to  a  very  nice  gentleman  in  kabul ,COMMA and  he  asked  what  i  thought  would  be  good  in  afghanistan .PERIOD and  i  explained  to  him  quickly ,COMMA i  would  train  psycho-social  counselors ,COMMA i  would  open  centers ,COMMA and  i  explained  to  him  why .PERIOD this  man  gave  me  his  contact  details  at  the  end  of  the  evening  and  said ,COMMA if  you  want  to  do  this ,COMMA call  me .PERIOD at  that  time ,COMMA it  was  the  head  of  caritas  germany .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  was  able  to  launch  a  three-year  project  with  caritas  germany ,COMMA and  we  trained  30  afghan  women  and  men ,COMMA and  we  opened  15  counseling  centers  in  kabul .PERIOD this  was  our  sign ,COMMA it  's  hand-painted .PERIOD and  we  had  45  all  over  kabul .PERIOD eleven  thousand  people  came ,COMMA more  than  that .PERIOD and  70  percent  regained  their  lives .PERIOD this  was  a  very  exciting  time ,COMMA developing  this  with  my  wonderful  afghan  team .PERIOD and  they  are  working  with  me  up  to  today .PERIOD we  developed  a  culturally-sensitive  psycho-social  counseling  approach .PERIOD so ,COMMA from  2008  up  until  today ,COMMA a  substantial  change  and  step  forward  has  been  taking  place .PERIOD the  european  union  delegation  in  kabul  came  into  this  and  hired  me  to  work  inside  the  ministry  of  public  health ,COMMA to  lobby  this  approach  -- .PERIOD we  succeeded .PERIOD we  revised  the  mental  health  component  of  the  primary  health  care  services  by  adding  psycho-social  care  and  psycho-social  counselors  to  the  system .PERIOD this  means ,COMMA certainly ,COMMA to  retrain  all  health  staff .PERIOD but  for  that ,COMMA we  already  have  the  training  manuals ,COMMA which  are  approved  by  the  ministry  and  moreover ,COMMA this  approach  is  now  part  of  the  mental  health  strategy  in  afghanistan .PERIOD so  we  also  have  implemented  it  already  in  some  selected  clinics  in  three  provinces ,COMMA and  you  are  the  first  to  see  the  results .PERIOD we  wanted  to  know  if  what  is  being  done  is  effective .PERIOD and  here  you  can  see  the  patients  all  had  symptoms  of  depression ,COMMA moderate  and  severe .PERIOD and  the  red  line  is  the  treatment  as  usual ,COMMA medication  with  a  medical  doctor .PERIOD and  all  the  symptoms  stayed  the  same  or  even  got  worse .PERIOD and  the  green  line  is  treatment  with  psycho-social  counseling  only ,COMMA without  medication .PERIOD and  you  can  see  the  symptoms  almost  completely  go  away ,COMMA and  the  psycho-social  stress  has  dropped  significantly ,COMMA which  is  explicable ,COMMA because  you  cannot  take  away  the  psycho-social  stresses ,COMMA but  you  can  learn  how  to  cope  with  them .PERIOD so  this  makes  us  very  happy ,COMMA because  now  we  also  have  some  evidence  that  this  is  working .PERIOD so  here  you  see ,COMMA this  is  a  health  facility  in  northern  afghanistan ,COMMA and  every  morning  it  looks  like  this  all  over .PERIOD and  doctors  usually  have  three  to  six  minutes  for  the  patients .PERIOD but  now  this  will  change .PERIOD they  go  to  the  clinics ,COMMA because  they  want  to  cure  their  immediate  symptoms ,COMMA and  they  will  find  somebody  to  talk  to  and  discuss  these  issues  and  talk  about  what  is  burdening  them  and  find  solutions ,COMMA develop  their  resources ,COMMA learn  tools  to  solve  their  family  conflicts  and  gain  some  confidence

odeo .PERIOD and  because  of  that  announcement ,COMMA we  got  a  big  article  in  the  new  york  times ,COMMA which  led  to  more  press ,COMMA which  led  to  more  attention ,COMMA and  me  deciding  to  become  ceo  of  that  company ,COMMA whereas  i  was  just  an  adviser ,COMMA and  raising  a  round  of  venture  capital  and  ramping  up  hiring .PERIOD one  of  the  guys  i  hired  was  an  engineer  named  jack  dorsey ,COMMA and  a  year  later  we  were  trying  to  decide  which  way  to  go  with  odeo ,COMMA and  jack  presented  an  idea  he'd  been  tinkering  around  with  for  a  number  of  years  that  was  based  around  sending  simple  status  updates  to  friends .PERIOD we  were  also  playing  with  sms  at  the  time  at  odeo ,COMMA so  we  kind  of  put  two  and  two  together ,COMMA and  in  early  2006  we  launched  twitter  as  a  side  project  at  odeo .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  's  hard  to  justify  doing  a  side  project  at  a  startup ,COMMA where  focus  is  so  critical ,COMMA but  i  had  actually  launched  blogger  as  a  side  project  to  my  previous  company ,COMMA thinking  it  was  just  a  little  thing  we'd  do  on  the  side ,COMMA and  it  ended  up  taking  over  not  only  the  company ,COMMA but  my  life  over  the  next  five  or  six  years .PERIOD so  i  learned  to  follow  hunches  even  though  you  cannot  necessarily  justify  them  or  know  where  they  're  going  to  go .PERIOD and  that  's  kind  of  what  's  happened  with  twitter ,COMMA time  after  time .PERIOD so ,COMMA for  those  of  you  unfamiliar ,COMMA twitter  is  based  around  a  very  simple ,COMMA seemingly  trivial  concept .PERIOD you  say  what  you  're  doing  in  140  characters  or  less ,COMMA and  people  who  are  interested  in  you  get  those  updates .PERIOD if  they  're  really  interested ,COMMA they  get  the  update  as  a  text  message  on  their  cell  phone .PERIOD so ,COMMA for  instance ,COMMA i  may  twitter  right  now  that  i  'm  giving  a  talk  at  ted .PERIOD it  's  a  normal  everyday  thing .PERIOD and  in  my  case ,COMMA when  i  hit  send ,COMMA up  to  60,000  people  will  receive  that  message  in  a  matter  of  seconds .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  fundamental  idea  is  that  twitter  lets  people  share  moments  of  their  lives  whenever  they  want ,COMMA be  they  momentous  occasions  or  mundane  ones .PERIOD it  is  by  sharing  these  moments  as  they  're  happening  that  lets  people  feel  more  connected  and  in  touch ,COMMA despite  distance ,COMMA and  in  real  time .PERIOD this  was  the  primary  use  we  saw  for  twitter  from  the  beginning ,COMMA and  what  got  us  excited .PERIOD what  we  did  n't  anticipate  was  the  many ,COMMA many  other  uses  that  would  evolve  from  this  very  simple  system .PERIOD one  of  the  things  we  realized  was  how  important  twitter  could  be  during  real-time  events .PERIOD when  the  wildfires  broke  out  in  san  diego ,COMMA in  october  of  2007 ,COMMA people  turned  to  twitter  to  report  what  was  happening  and  to  find  information  from  neighbors  about  what  was  happening  around  them .PERIOD but  it  was  n't  just  individuals .PERIOD the  la .PERIOD times  actually  turned  to  twitter  to  dispense  information  as  well ,COMMA and  put  a  twitter  feed  on  the  front  page ,COMMA and  the  la .PERIOD fire  department  and  red  cross  used  it  to  dispense  news  and  updates  as  well .PERIOD at  this  event ,COMMA dozens  of  people  are  twittering  and  thousands  of  people  are  following  along  because  they  want  to  know  what  it  feels  like  to  be  here  and  what  's  happening .PERIOD among  the  other  interesting  things  that  have  cropped  up  are  many  things  from  businesses ,COMMA from  marketing  and  communications  and  predictable  things ,COMMA to  an  insanely  popular  korean-barbecue  taco  truck  that  drives  around  la .PERIOD and  twitters  where  it  stops ,COMMA causing  a  line  to  form  around  the  block .PERIOD politicians  have  recently  begun  twittering .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA there  are  47  members  of  congress  who  currently  have  twitter  accounts .PERIOD and  they  're  tweeting ,COMMA in  some  cases ,COMMA from  behind  closed-door  sessions  with  the  president .PERIOD in  this  case ,COMMA this  guy  's  not  liking  what  he  's  hearing .PERIOD the  president  himself  is  our  most  popular  twitter  user ,COMMA although  his  tweets  have  dropped  off  as  of  late ,COMMA while  senator  mccain  's  have  picked  up .PERIOD as  have  this  guy  's .PERIOD twitter  was  originally  designed  as  a  broadcast  medium: .PERIOD you  send  one  message  and  it  goes  out  to  everybody ,COMMA and  you  receive  the  messages  you  're  interested  in .PERIOD one  of  the  many  ways  that  users  shaped  the  evolution  of  twitter  was  by  inventing  a  way  to  reply  to  a  specific  person  or  a  specific  message .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  syntax ,COMMA the  @username  that  shaquille  o'neal  's  using  here  to  reply  to  one  of  his  fans ,COMMA was  completely  invented  by  users ,COMMA and  we  did  n't  build  it  into  the  system  until  it  already  became  popular  and  then  we  made  it  easier .PERIOD this  is  one  of  the  many  ways  that  users  have  shaped  the  system .PERIOD another  is  via  the  api .PERIOD we  built  an  application-programming  interface ,COMMA which  basically  means  that  programmers  can  write  software  that  interacts  with  twitter .PERIOD we  currently  know  about  over  2,000  pieces  of  software  that  can  send  twitter  updates ,COMMA interfaces  for  mac ,COMMA windows ,COMMA your  iphone ,COMMA your  blackberry  -- .PERIOD as  well  as  things  like  a  device  that  lets  an  unborn  baby  twitter  when  it  kicks  or  a  plant  twitter  when  it  needs  water .PERIOD probably  the  most  important  third-party  development  came  from  a  little  company  in  virginia  called  summize .PERIOD summize  built  a  twitter  search  engine .PERIOD and  they  tapped  into  the  fact  that ,COMMA if  you  have  millions  of  people  around  the  world  talking  about  what  they  're  doing  and  what  's  around  them ,COMMA you  have  an  incredible  resource  to  find  out  about  any  topic  or  event  while  it  's  going  on .PERIOD this  really  changed  how  we  perceived  twitter .PERIOD for  instance ,COMMA here  's  what  people  are  saying  about  ted .PERIOD this  is  another  way  that  our  mind  was  shifted ,COMMA and  twitter  was  n't  what  we  thought  it  was .PERIOD we  liked  this  so  much  we  actually  bought  the  company  and  are  folding  it  into  the  main  product .PERIOD this  not  only  lets  you  view  twitters  in  different  ways ,COMMA but  it  introduces  new  use  cases  as  well .PERIOD one  of  my  favorites  is  what  happened  a  few  months  ago  when  there  was  a  gas  shortage  in  atlanta .PERIOD some  users  figured  out  that  they  would  twitter  when  they  found  gas ,COMMA where  it  was ,COMMA and  how  much  it  cost ,COMMA and  then  appended  the  keyword  #atlgas  so  that  other  people  search  for  that  and  find  gas  themselves .PERIOD and  this  trend  of  people  using  this  communication  network  to  help  each  other  out  goes  far  beyond  the  original  idea  of  just  keeping  up  with  family  and  friends .PERIOD it  's  happened  more  and  more  lately ,COMMA whether  it  's  raising  money  for  homeless  people  or  to  dig  wells  in  africa  or  for  a  family  in  crisis .PERIOD people  have  raised  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars  over  twitter  in  a  matter  of  days  on  several  occasions .PERIOD it  seems  like  when  you  give  people  easier  ways  to  share  information ,COMMA more  good  things  happen .PERIOD i  have  no  idea  what  will  happen  next  with  twitter .PERIOD i've  learned  to  follow  the  hunch ,COMMA but  never  assume  where  it  will  go .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD chris  anderson ,COMMA we  're  not  quite  done  yet .PERIOD so ,COMMA look ,COMMA if  we  could  have  this  screen  live .PERIOD this  is  actually  the  most  terrifying  thing  that  any  speaker  can  do  after  they've  been  to  an  event .PERIOD it  's  totally  intimidating .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  would  be  the  twitter  search  screen .PERIOD let  's  type  a  couple  of  random  words  into  twitter .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA evan  williams .PERIOD give  people  more  information  and  follow  your  hunch  @  #ted .PERIOD currently  listening  to  evan  williams .PERIOD oh .PERIOD evan  williams  is  just  dying  on  stage  here  at  ted .PERIOD worst  talk  ever  evan  williams ,COMMA nice .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD ca ,COMMA just  kidding .PERIOD but ,COMMA literally  in  the  eight  minutes  he  was  talking ,COMMA there  are  about  fifty  tweets  that  already  came  on  the  talk .PERIOD so  he  'll  see  every  aspect  of  the  reaction ,COMMA the  fact  that  barack  obama  is  the  biggest  twitterer ,COMMA the  fact  that  it  came  out  of  ted .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  there  's  any  other  way  of  getting  instant  feedback  that  way .PERIOD you  have  build  something  very  fascinating ,COMMA and  it  looks  like  its  best  times  are  still  ahead  of  it .PERIOD so ,COMMA thank  you  very  much ,COMMA evan .PERIOD that  was  very  interesting .PERIOD ew ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD well ,COMMA first  of  all ,COMMA let  me  thank  emeka ,COMMA as  a  matter  of  fact ,COMMA ted  global ,COMMA for  putting  this  conference  together .PERIOD this  conference  is  going  to  rank  as  the  most  important  in  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century .PERIOD think  african  governments  will  put  together  a  conference  like  this ?QUESTIONMARK you  think  the  au .PERIOD will  put  together  a  conference  like  this ?QUESTIONMARK even  before  they  do  that  they  will  ask  for  foreign  aid .PERIOD i  would  also  like  to  pay  homage  and  honor  to  the  ted  fellows  june  arunga ,COMMA james  shikwati ,COMMA andrew ,COMMA and  the  other  ted  fellows .PERIOD i  call  them  the  cheetah  generation .PERIOD the  cheetah  generation  is  a  new  breed  of  africans  who  brook  no  nonsense  about  corruption .PERIOD they  understand  what  accountability  and  democracy  is .PERIOD they  're  not  going  to  wait  for  government  to  do  things  for  them .PERIOD that  's  the  cheetah  generation .PERIOD and  africa  's  salvation  rests  on  the  backs  of  these  cheetahs .PERIOD in  contrast ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA we  have  the  hippo  generation .PERIOD the  hippo  generation  are  the  ruling  elites .PERIOD they  are  stuck  in  their  intellectual  patch .PERIOD complaining  about  colonialism  and  imperialism ,COMMA they  would  n't  move  one  foot .PERIOD if  you  ask  them  to  reform  the  economies ,COMMA they  're  not  going  to  reform  it  because  they  benefit  from  the  rotten  status  quo .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  are  a  lot  of  africans  who  are  very  angry ,COMMA angry  at  the  condition  of  africa .PERIOD now ,COMMA we  're  talking  about  a  continent  that  is  not  poor .PERIOD it  is  rich  in  mineral  resources ,COMMA natural  mineral  resources .PERIOD but  the  mineral  wealth  of  africa  is  not  being  utilized  to  lift  its  people  out  of  poverty .PERIOD that  's  what  makes  a  lot  of  africans  very  angry .PERIOD and  in  a  way ,COMMA africa  is  more  than  a  tragedy ,COMMA in  more  ways  than  one .PERIOD there  's  another  enduring  tragedy ,COMMA and  that  tragedy  is  that  there  are  so  many  people ,COMMA so  many  governments ,COMMA so  many  organizations  who  want  to  help  the  people  in  africa .PERIOD they  do  n't  understand .PERIOD now ,COMMA we  're  not  saying  do  n't  help  africa .PERIOD helping  africa  is  noble .PERIOD but  helping  africa  has  been  turned  into  a  theater  of  the  absurd .PERIOD it  's  like  the  blind  leading  the  clueless .PERIOD there  are  certain  things  that  we  need  to  recognize .PERIOD africa  's  begging-bowl  leaks .PERIOD did  you  know  that  40  percent  of  the  wealth  created  in  africa  is  not  invested  here  in  africa ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  taken  out  of  africa .PERIOD that  's  what  the  world  bank  says .PERIOD look  at  africa  's  begging-bowl .PERIOD it  leaks  horribly .PERIOD there  are  people  who  think  that  we  should  pour  more  money ,COMMA more  aid  into  this  bowl  which  leaks .PERIOD what  are  the  leakages ?QUESTIONMARK corruption  alone  costs  africa  148  billion  dollars  a  year .PERIOD yes ,COMMA put  that  aside .PERIOD capital  flight  out  of  africa ,COMMA 80  billion  a  year .PERIOD put  that  aside .PERIOD let  's  take  food  imports .PERIOD every  year  africa  spends  20  billion  dollars  to  import  food .PERIOD just  add  that  up ,COMMA all  these  leakages .PERIOD that  's  far  more  than  the  50  billion  tony  blair  wants  to  raise  for  africa .PERIOD now ,COMMA back  in  the  1960s  africa  not  only  fed  itself ,COMMA it  also  exported  food .PERIOD not  anymore .PERIOD we  know  that  something  has  gone  fundamentally  wrong .PERIOD you  know  it ,COMMA i  know  it ,COMMA but  let  's  not  waste  our  time  talking  about  these  mistakes  because  we  'll  spend  all  day  here .PERIOD let  's  move  on ,COMMA and  flip  over  to  the  next  chapter .PERIOD and  that  's  what  this  conference  is  all  about ,COMMA the  next  chapter .PERIOD the  next  chapter  begins  with  first  of  all ,COMMA asking  ourselves  this  fundamental  question ,COMMA whom  do  we  want  to  help  in  africa ?QUESTIONMARK there  is  the  people ,COMMA and  then  there  is  the  government  or  leaders .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  previous  speaker  before  me ,COMMA idris  mohammed ,COMMA indicated  that  we've  had  abysmal  leadership  in  africa .PERIOD that  characterization ,COMMA in  my  view ,COMMA is  even  more  charitable .PERIOD i  belong  to  an  internet  discussion  forum ,COMMA an  african  internet  discussion  forum ,COMMA and  i  asked  them ,COMMA i  said ,COMMA since  1960 ,COMMA we've  had  exactly  204  african  heads  of  state ,COMMA since  1960 .PERIOD and  i  asked  them  to  name  me  just  20  good  leaders ,COMMA just  20  good  leaders ,COMMA you  may  want  to  take  this  leadership  challenge  yourself .PERIOD i  asked  them  to  name  me  just  20 .PERIOD everybody  mentioned  nelson  mandela ,COMMA of  course .PERIOD kwame  nkrumah ,COMMA nyerere ,COMMA kenyatta ,COMMA somebody  mentioned  idi  amin .PERIOD i  let  that  pass .PERIOD my  point  is ,COMMA they  could  n't  go  beyond  15 .PERIOD even  if  they  had  been  able  to  name  me  20 ,COMMA what  does  that  tell  you ?QUESTIONMARK 20  out  of  204  means  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  african  leaders  failed  their  people .PERIOD and  if  you  look  at  them ,COMMA the  slate  of  the  post-colonial  leaders ,COMMA an  assortment  of  military  fufu  heads .PERIOD swiss-bank  socialists ,COMMA crocodile  liberators ,COMMA vampire  elites ,COMMA quack  revolutionaries .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  leadership  is  a  far  cry  from  the  traditional  leaders  that  africans  have  known  for  centuries .PERIOD the  second  false  premise  that  we  make  when  we  're  trying  to  help  africa  is  that  sometimes  we  think  that  there  is  something  called  a  government  in  africa  that  cares  about  its  people ,COMMA serves  the  interests  of  the  people ,COMMA and  represents  the  people .PERIOD there  is  one  particular  quote ,COMMA a  lesotho  chief  once  said  that  here  in  lesotho ,COMMA we've  got  two  problems ,COMMA rats  and  the  government .PERIOD what  you  and  i  understand  as  a  government  does  n't  exist  in  many  african  countries .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA what  we  call  our  governments  are  vampire  states .PERIOD vampires  because  they  suck  the  economic  vitality  out  of  their  people .PERIOD government  is  the  problem  in  africa .PERIOD a  vampire  state  is  the  government ,COMMA which  has  been  hijacked  by  a  phalanx  of  bandits  and  crooks  who  use  the  instruments  of  state  power  to  enrich  themselves ,COMMA their  cronies ,COMMA and  tribesmen  and  exclude  everybody  else .PERIOD the  richest  people  in  africa  are  heads-of-state  and  ministers ,COMMA and  quite  often  the  chief  bandit  is  the  head-of-state  himself .PERIOD where  do  they  get  their  money ?QUESTIONMARK by  creating  wealth ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD by  raking  it  off  the  backs  of  their  suffering  people .PERIOD that  's  not  wealth  creation .PERIOD it  's  wealth  redistribution .PERIOD the  third  fundamental  issue  that  we  have  to  recognize  is  that  if  we  want  to  help  the  african  people ,COMMA we  must  know  where  the  african  people  are .PERIOD take  any  african  economy .PERIOD an  african  economy  can  be  broken  up  into  three  sectors .PERIOD there  is  the  modern  sector ,COMMA there  is  the  informal  sector  and  the  traditional  sector .PERIOD the  modern  sector  is  the  abode  of  the  elites .PERIOD it  's  the  seat  of  government .PERIOD in  many  african  countries  the  modern  sector  is  lost .PERIOD it  's  dysfunctional .PERIOD it  is  a  meretricious  fandango  of  imported  systems ,COMMA which  the  elites  themselves  do  n't  understand .PERIOD that  is  the  source  of  many  of  africa  's  problems  where  the  struggles  for  political  power  emanate  and  then  spill  over  onto  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sector ,COMMA claiming  innocent  lives .PERIOD now  the  modern  sector ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA is  where  a  lot  of  the  development  aid  and  resources  went  into .PERIOD more  than  80  percent  of  ivory  coast  's  development  went  into  the  modern  sector .PERIOD the  other  sectors ,COMMA the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors ,COMMA are  where  you  find  the  majority  of  the  african  people .PERIOD the  real  people  in  africa .PERIOD that  's  where  you  find  them .PERIOD now ,COMMA obviously  it  makes  common  sense  that  if  you  want  to  help  the  people ,COMMA you  go  where  the  people  are .PERIOD but  that  's  not  what  we  did .PERIOD as  a  matter  of  fact ,COMMA we  neglected  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors .PERIOD now ,COMMA traditional  sector  is  where  africa  produces  its  agriculture ,COMMA which  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  africa  cannot  feed  itself ,COMMA and  that  's  why  it  must  import  food .PERIOD all  right ,COMMA you  cannot  develop  africa  by  ignoring  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors .PERIOD and  you  cannot  develop  the  informal  and  the  traditional  sectors  without  an  operational  understanding  of  how  these  two  sectors  work .PERIOD these  two  sectors ,COMMA let  me  describe  to  you ,COMMA have  their  own  indigenous  institutions .PERIOD first  one  is  the  political  system .PERIOD traditionally ,COMMA africans  hate  governments .PERIOD they  hate  tyranny .PERIOD if  you  look  into  their  traditional  systems ,COMMA africans  organize  their  states  in  two  types .PERIOD the  first  one  belongs  to  those  ethnic  societies  who  believe  that  the  state  was  necessarily  tyrannous ,COMMA so  they  did  n't  want  to  have  anything  to  do  with  any  centralized  authority .PERIOD these  societies  are  the  ibo ,COMMA the  somali ,COMMA the  kikuyus ,COMMA for  example .PERIOD they  have  no  chiefs .PERIOD the  other  ethnic  groups ,COMMA which  did  have  chiefs ,COMMA made  sure  that  they  surrounded  the  chiefs  with  councils  upon  councils  upon  councils  to  prevent  them  from  abusing  their  power .PERIOD in  ashanti  tradition ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA the  chief  cannot  make  any  decision  without  the  concurrence  of  the  council  of  elders .PERIOD without  the  council  the  chief  cannot  pass  any  law ,COMMA and  if  the  chief  does  n't  govern  according  to  the  will  of  the  people  he  will  be  removed .PERIOD if  not ,COMMA the  people  will  abandon  the  chief ,COMMA go  somewhere  else  and  set  up  a  new  settlement .PERIOD and  even  if  you  look  in  ancient  african  empires ,COMMA they  were  all  organized  around  one  particular  principle ,COMMA the  confederacy  principle ,COMMA which  is  characterized  by  a  great  deal  of  devolution  of  authority ,COMMA decentralization  of  power .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  is  what  i  have  described  to  you .PERIOD this  is  part  of  africa  's  indigenous  political  heritage .PERIOD now ,COMMA compare  that  to  the  modern  systems  the  ruling  elites  established  on  africa .PERIOD it  is  a  total  far  cry .PERIOD in  the  economic  system  in  traditional  africa ,COMMA the  means  of  production  is  privately  owned .PERIOD it  's  owned  by  extended  families .PERIOD you  see ,COMMA in  the  west ,COMMA the  basic  economic  and  social  unit  is  the  individual .PERIOD the  american  will  say ,COMMA i  am  because  i  am ,COMMA and  i  can  damn  well  do  anything  i  want ,COMMA anytime .PERIOD the  accent  is  on  the  i .PERIOD in  africa ,COMMA the  africans  say ,COMMA i  am ,COMMA because  we  are .PERIOD the  we  connotes  community ,COMMA the  extended  family  system .PERIOD the  extended  family  system  pools  its  resources  together .PERIOD they  own  farms .PERIOD they  decide  what  to  do ,COMMA what  to  produce .PERIOD they  do  n't  take  any  orders  from  their  chiefs .PERIOD they  decide  what  to  do .PERIOD and  when  they  produce  their  crops ,COMMA they  sell  the  surplus  on  marketplaces .PERIOD when  they  make  a  profit  it  is  theirs  to  keep ,COMMA not  for  the  chief  to  sequester  it  from  them .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  a  nutshell ,COMMA what  we  had  in  traditional  africa  was  a  free-market  system .PERIOD there  were  markets  in  africa  before  the  colonialists  stepped  foot  on  the  continent .PERIOD timbuktu  was  one  great  big  market  town .PERIOD kano ,COMMA salaga ,COMMA they  were  all  there .PERIOD even  if  you  go  to  west  africa ,COMMA you  notice  that  market  activity  in  west  africa  has  always  been  dominated  by  women .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  's  quite  appropriate  that  this  section  is  called  a  marketplace .PERIOD the  market  is  not  alien  to  africa .PERIOD what  africans  practiced  was  a  different  form  of  capitalism ,COMMA but  then  after  independence ,COMMA all  of  a  sudden ,COMMA markets ,COMMA capitalism  became  a  western  institution ,COMMA and  the  leaders  said  africans  were  ready  for  socialism .PERIOD nonsense .PERIOD and  even  then ,COMMA what  kind  of  socialism  did  they  practice ?QUESTIONMARK the  socialism  that  they  practiced  was  a  peculiar  form  of  swiss-bank  socialism ,COMMA which  allowed  the  heads  of  states  and  the  ministers  to  rape  and  plunder  africa  's  treasuries  for  deposit  in  switzerland .PERIOD that  is  not  the  kind  of  system  africans  had  known  for  centuries .PERIOD what  do  we  do  now ?QUESTIONMARK go  back  to  africa  's  indigenous  institutions ,COMMA and  this  is  where  we  charge  the  cheetahs  to  go  into  the  informal  sectors ,COMMA the  traditional  sectors .PERIOD that  's  where  you  find  the  african  people .PERIOD and  i'd  like  to  show  you  a  quick  little  video  about  the  informal  sector ,COMMA about  the  boat-building  that  i ,COMMA myself ,COMMA tried  to  mobilize  africans  in  the  diaspora  to  invest  in .PERIOD could  you  please  show  that ?QUESTIONMARK the  men  are  going  fishing  in  these  small  boats .PERIOD yes ,COMMA it  's  an  enterprise .PERIOD this  is  by  a  local  ghanaian  entrepreneur ,COMMA using  his  own  capital .PERIOD he  's  getting  no  assistance  from  the  government ,COMMA and  he  's  building  a  second ,COMMA bigger  boat .PERIOD a  bigger  boat  will  mean  more  fish  will  be  caught  and  landed .PERIOD it  means  that  he  will  be  able  to  employ  more  ghanaians .PERIOD it  also  means  that  he  will  be  able  to  generate  wealth .PERIOD and  then  it  will  have  what  economists  call  external  effects  on  a  local  economy .PERIOD all  that  you  need  to  do ,COMMA all  that  the  elites  need  to  do ,COMMA is  to  move  this  operation  into  something  that  is  enclosed  so  that  the  operation  can  be  made  more  efficient .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  is  not  just  this  informal  sector .PERIOD there  is  also  traditional  medicine .PERIOD 80  percent  of  africans  still  rely  on  traditional  medicine .PERIOD the  modern  healthcare  sector  has  totally  collapsed .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  is  an  area ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA there  is  a  treasure  trove  of  wealth  in  the  traditional  medicine  area .PERIOD this  is  where  we  need  to  mobilize  africans ,COMMA in  the  diaspora  especially ,COMMA to  invest  in  this .PERIOD we  also  need  to  mobilize  africans  in  the  diaspora ,COMMA not  only  to  go  into  the  traditional  sectors ,COMMA but  to  go  into  agriculture  and  also  to  instigate  change  from  within .PERIOD we  were  able  to  mobilize  ghanaians  in  the  diaspora  to  instigate  change  in  ghana  and  bring  about  democracy  in  ghana .PERIOD and  i  know  that  with  the  cheetahs ,COMMA we  can  take  africa  back  one  village  at  a  time .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD you  will  understand  nothing  with  my  type  of  english .PERIOD it  's  good  for  you  because  you  can  have  a  break  after  all  these  fantastic  people .PERIOD i  must  tell  you  i  am  like  that ,COMMA not  very  comfortable ,COMMA because  usually ,COMMA in  life ,COMMA i  think  my  job  is  absolutely  useless .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA i  feel  useless .PERIOD now  after  carolyn ,COMMA and  all  the  other  guys ,COMMA i  feel  like  shit .PERIOD and  definitively ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  why  i  am  here ,COMMA but ,COMMA you  know  the  nightmare  you  can  have ,COMMA like  you  are  an  impostor ,COMMA you  arrive  at  the  opera ,COMMA and  they  push  you ,COMMA you  must  sing .PERIOD i  do  n't  know .PERIOD so ,COMMA so ,COMMA because  i  have  nothing  to  show ,COMMA nothing  to  say ,COMMA we  shall  try  to  speak  about  something  else .PERIOD we  can  start ,COMMA if  you  want ,COMMA by  understanding ,COMMA it  's  just  to  start ,COMMA it  's  not  interesting ,COMMA but ,COMMA how  i  work .PERIOD when  somebody  comes  to  me  and  ask  for  what  i  am  known ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA yes ,COMMA lemon  squeezer ,COMMA toilet  brush ,COMMA toothpick ,COMMA beautiful  toilet  seats ,COMMA and  why  not ,COMMA a  toothbrush ?QUESTIONMARK i  do  n't  try  to  design  the  toothbrush .PERIOD i  do  n't  try  to  say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA that  will  be  a  beautiful  object ,COMMA or  something  like  that .PERIOD that  does  n't  interest  me .PERIOD because  there  is  different  types  of  design .PERIOD the  one ,COMMA we  can  call  it  the  cynical  design ,COMMA that  means  the  design  invented  by  raymond  loewy  in  the  50s ,COMMA who  said ,COMMA what  is  ugly  is  a  bad  sale ,COMMA la  laideur  se  vend  mal ,COMMA which  is  terrible .PERIOD it  means  the  design  must  be  just  the  weapon  for  marketing ,COMMA for  producer  to  make  product  more  sexy ,COMMA like  that ,COMMA they  sell  more ,COMMA it  's  shit ,COMMA it  's  obsolete ,COMMA it  's  ridiculous .PERIOD i  call  that  the  cynical  design .PERIOD after ,COMMA there  is  the  narcissistic  design ,COMMA it  's  a  fantastic  designer  who  designs  only  for  other  fantastic  designers .PERIOD after ,COMMA there  is  people  like  me ,COMMA who  try  to  deserve  to  exist ,COMMA and  who  are  so  ashamed  to  make  this  useless  job ,COMMA who  try  to  do  it  in  another  way ,COMMA and  they  try ,COMMA i  try ,COMMA to  not  make  the  object  for  the  object  but  for  the  result ,COMMA for  the  profit  for  the  human  being ,COMMA the  person  who  will  use  it .PERIOD if  we  take  the  toothbrush ,COMMA i  do  n't  think  about  the  toothbrush .PERIOD i  think ,COMMA what  will  be  the  effect  of  the  brush  in  the  mouth ?QUESTIONMARK and  to  understand  what  will  be  the  effect  of  the  toothbrush  in  the  mouth ,COMMA i  must  imagine ,COMMA who  owns  this  mouth ?QUESTIONMARK what  is  the  life  of  the  owner  of  this  mouth ?QUESTIONMARK in  what  society  does  this  guy  live ?QUESTIONMARK what  civilization  creates  this  society ?QUESTIONMARK what  animal  species  creates  this  civilization ?QUESTIONMARK when  i  arrive ,COMMA and  i  take  one  minute ,COMMA i  am  not  so  intelligent ,COMMA when  i  arrive  at  the  level  of  animal  species ,COMMA that  becomes  real  interesting .PERIOD me ,COMMA i  have  strictly  no  power  to  change  anything .PERIOD but  when  i  come  back ,COMMA i  can  understand  why  i  shall  not  do  it ,COMMA because  today  to  not  do  it ,COMMA it  's  more  positive  than  do  it ,COMMA or  how  i  shall  do  it .PERIOD but  to  come  back ,COMMA where  i  am  at  the  animal  species ,COMMA there  is  things  to  see .PERIOD there  is  things  to  see ,COMMA there  is  the  big  challenge .PERIOD the  big  challenge  in  front  of

an  ouroboros ,COMMA where  you  see  the  micro-world  on  the  left ,COMMA the  world  of  the  quantum ,COMMA and  on  the  right  the  large-scale  universe  of  planets ,COMMA stars  and  galaxies .PERIOD we  know  our  universes  are  united  though ,COMMA links  between  left  and  right .PERIOD the  everyday  world  is  determined  by  atoms ,COMMA how  they  stick  together  to  make  molecules .PERIOD stars  are  fueled  by  how  the  nuclei  in  those  atoms  react  together .PERIOD and ,COMMA as  we've  learned  in  the  last  few  years ,COMMA galaxies  are  held  together  by  the  gravitational  pull  of  so-called  dark  matter ,COMMA particles  in  huge  swarms ,COMMA far  smaller  even  than  atomic  nuclei .PERIOD but  we'd  like  to  know  the  synthesis  symbolized  at  the  very  top .PERIOD the  micro-world  of  the  quantum  is  understood .PERIOD on  the  right  hand  side ,COMMA gravity  holds  sway .PERIOD einstein  explained  that .PERIOD but  the  unfinished  business  for  21st-century  science  is  to  link  together  cosmos  and  micro-world  with  a  unified  theory ,COMMA symbolized ,COMMA as  it  were ,COMMA gastronomically  at  the  top  of  that  picture .PERIOD and  until  we  have  that  synthesis ,COMMA we  wo  n't  be  able  to  understand  the  very  beginning  of  our  universe  because  when  our  universe  was  itself  the  size  of  an  atom ,COMMA quantum  effects  could  shake  everything .PERIOD and  so  we  need  a  theory  that  unifies  the  very  large  and  the  very  small ,COMMA which  we  do  n't  yet  have .PERIOD one  idea ,COMMA incidentally ,COMMA and  i  had  this  hazard  sign  to  say  i  'm  going  to  speculate  from  now  on ,COMMA is  that  our  big  bang  was  not  the  only  one .PERIOD one  idea  is  that  our  three-dimensional  universe  may  be  embedded  in  a  high-dimensional  space ,COMMA just  as  you  can  imagine  on  these  sheets  of  paper .PERIOD you  can  imagine  ants  on  one  of  them  thinking  it  's  a  two-dimensional  universe ,COMMA not  being  aware  of  another  population  of  ants  on  the  other .PERIOD so  there  could  be  another  universe  just  a  millimeter  away  from  ours ,COMMA but  we  're  not  aware  of  it  because  that  millimeter  is  measured  in  some  fourth  spatial  dimension ,COMMA and  we  're  imprisoned  in  our  three .PERIOD and  so  we  believe  that  there  may  be  a  lot  more  to  physical  reality  than  what  we've  normally  called  our  universe ,COMMA the  aftermath  of  our  big  bang .PERIOD and  here  's  another  picture .PERIOD bottom  right  depicts  our  universe ,COMMA which  on  the  horizon  is  not  beyond  that ,COMMA but  even  that  is  just  one  bubble ,COMMA as  it  were ,COMMA in  some  vaster  reality .PERIOD many  people  suspect  that  just  as  we've  gone  from  believing  in  one  solar  system  to  zillions  of  solar  systems ,COMMA one  galaxy  to  many  galaxies ,COMMA we  have  to  go  to  many  big  bangs  from  one  big  bang .PERIOD perhaps  these  many  big  bangs  displaying  an  immense  variety  of  properties .PERIOD well ,COMMA let  's  go  back  to  this  picture .PERIOD there  's  one  challenge  symbolized  at  the  top ,COMMA but  there  's  another  challenge  to  science  symbolized  at  the  bottom .PERIOD you  want  to  not  only  synthesize  the  very  large  and  the  very  small ,COMMA but  we  want  to  understand  the  very  complex .PERIOD and  the  most  complex  things  are  ourselves ,COMMA midway  between  atoms  and  stars .PERIOD we  depend  on  stars  to  make  the  atoms  we  're  made  of .PERIOD we  depend  on  chemistry  to  determine  our  complex  structure .PERIOD we  clearly  have  to  be  large ,COMMA compared  to  atoms ,COMMA to  have  layer  upon  layer  of  complex  structure .PERIOD we  clearly  have  to  be  small ,COMMA compared  to  stars  and  planets ,COMMA otherwise  we'd  be  crushed  by  gravity .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA we  are  midway .PERIOD it  would  take  as  many  human  bodies  to  make  up  the  sun  as  there  are  atoms  in  each  of  us .PERIOD the  geometric  mean  of  the  mass  of  a  proton  and  the  mass  of  the  sun  is  50  kilograms ,COMMA within  a  factor  of  two  of  the  mass  of  each  person  here .PERIOD well ,COMMA most  of  you  anyway .PERIOD the  science  of  complexity  is  probably  the  greatest  challenge  of  all ,COMMA greater  than  that  of  the  very  small  on  the  left  and  the  very  large  on  the  right .PERIOD and  it  's  this  science ,COMMA which  is  not  only  enlightening  our  understanding  of  the  biological  world ,COMMA but  also  transforming  our  world  faster  than  ever .PERIOD and  more  than  that ,COMMA it  's  engendering  new  kinds  of  change .PERIOD and  i  now  move  on  to  the  second  part  of  my  talk ,COMMA and  the  book  our  final  century  was  mentioned .PERIOD if  i  was  not  a  self-effacing  brit ,COMMA i  would  mention  the  book  myself ,COMMA and  i  would  add  that  it  's  available  in  paperback .PERIOD and  in  america  it  was  called  our  final  hour  because  americans  like  instant  gratification .PERIOD but  my  theme  is  that  in  this  century ,COMMA not  only  has  science  changed  the  world  faster  than  ever ,COMMA but  in  new  and  different  ways .PERIOD targeted  drugs ,COMMA genetic  modification ,COMMA artificial  intelligence ,COMMA perhaps  even  implants  into  our  brains ,COMMA may  change  human  beings  themselves .PERIOD and  human  beings ,COMMA their  physique  and  character ,COMMA has  not  changed  for  thousands  of  years .PERIOD it  may  change  this  century .PERIOD it  's  new  in  our  history .PERIOD and  the  human  impact  on  the  global  environment ,COMMA greenhouse  warming ,COMMA mass  extinctions  and  so  forth ,COMMA is  unprecedented ,COMMA too .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA this  makes  this  coming  century  a  challenge .PERIOD bio-  and  cybertechnologies  are  environmentally  benign  in  that  they  offer  marvelous  prospects ,COMMA while ,COMMA nonetheless ,COMMA reducing  pressure  on  energy  and  resources .PERIOD but  they  will  have  a  dark  side .PERIOD in  our  interconnected  world ,COMMA novel  technology  could  empower  just  one  fanatic ,COMMA or  some  weirdo  with  a  mindset  of  those  who  now  design  computer  viruses ,COMMA to  trigger  some  kind  on  disaster .PERIOD indeed ,COMMA catastrophe  could  arise  simply  from  technical  misadventure ,COMMA error  rather  than  terror .PERIOD and  even  a  tiny  probability  of  catastrophe  is  unacceptable  when  the  downside  could  be  of  global  consequence .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA some  years  ago ,COMMA bill  joy  wrote  an  article  expressing  tremendous  concern  about  robots  taking  us  over ,COMMA etc .PERIOD i  do  n't  go  along  with  all  that ,COMMA but  it  's  interesting  that  he  had  a  simple  solution .PERIOD it  was  what  he  called  fine-grained  relinquishment .PERIOD he  wanted  to  give  up  the  dangerous  kind  of  science  and  keep  the  good  bits .PERIOD now ,COMMA that  's  absurdly  naive  for  two  reasons .PERIOD first ,COMMA any  scientific  discovery  has  benign  consequences  as  well  as  dangerous  ones .PERIOD and  also ,COMMA when  a  scientist  makes  a  discovery ,COMMA he  or  she  normally  has  no  clue  what  the  applications  are  going  to  be .PERIOD and  so  what  this  means  is  that  we  have  to  accept  the  risks  if  we  are  going  to  enjoy  the  benefits  of  science .PERIOD we  have  to  accept  that  there  will  be  hazards .PERIOD and  i  think  we  have  to  go  back  to  what  happened  in  the  post-war  era ,COMMA post-world  war  ii ,COMMA when  the  nuclear  scientists  who'd  been  involved  in  making  the  atomic  bomb ,COMMA in  many  cases  were  concerned  that  they  should  do  all  they  could  to  alert  the  world  to  the  dangers .PERIOD and  they  were  inspired  not  by  the  young  einstein ,COMMA who  did  the  great  work  in  relativity ,COMMA but  by  the  old  einstein ,COMMA the  icon  of  poster  and  t-shirt ,COMMA who  failed  in  his  scientific  efforts  to  unify  the  physical  laws .PERIOD he  was  premature .PERIOD but  he  was  a  moral  compass ,COMMA an  inspiration  to  scientists  who  were  concerned  with  arms  control .PERIOD and  perhaps  the  greatest  living  person  is  someone  i  'm  privileged  to  know ,COMMA joe  rothblatt .PERIOD equally  untidy  office  there ,COMMA as  you  can  see .PERIOD he  's  96  years  old ,COMMA and  he  founded  the  pugwash  movement .PERIOD he  persuaded  einstein ,COMMA as  his  last  act ,COMMA to  sign  the  famous  memorandum  of  bertrand  russell .PERIOD and  he  sets  an  example  of  the  concerned  scientist .PERIOD and  i  think  to  harness  science  optimally ,COMMA to  choose  which  doors  to  open  and  which  to  leave  closed ,COMMA we  need  latter-day  counterparts  of  people  like  joseph  rothblatt .PERIOD we  need  not  just  campaigning  physicists ,COMMA but  we  need  biologists ,COMMA computer  experts  and  environmentalists  as  well .PERIOD and  i  think  academics  and  independent  entrepreneurs  have  a  special  obligation  because  they  have  more  freedom  than  those  in  government  service ,COMMA or  company  employees  subject  to  commercial  pressure .PERIOD i  wrote  my  book ,COMMA our  final  century ,COMMA as  a  scientist ,COMMA just  a  general  scientist .PERIOD but  there  's  one  respect ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA in  which  being  a  cosmologist  offered  a  special  perspective ,COMMA and  that  's  that  it  offers  an  awareness  of  the  immense  future .PERIOD the  stupendous  time  spans  of  the  evolutionary  past  are  now  part  of  common  culture ,COMMA outside  the  american  bible  belt ,COMMA anyway ,COMMA but  most  people ,COMMA even  those  who  are  familiar  with  evolution ,COMMA are  n't  mindful  that  even  more  time  lies  ahead .PERIOD the  sun  has  been  shining  for  four  and  a  half  billion  years ,COMMA but  it  'll  be  another  six  billion  years  before  its  fuel  runs  out .PERIOD on  that  schematic  picture ,COMMA a  sort  of  time-lapse  picture ,COMMA we  're  halfway .PERIOD and  it  'll  be  another  six  billion  before  that  happens ,COMMA and  any  remaining  life  on  earth  is  vaporized .PERIOD there  's  an  unthinking  tendency  to  imagine  that  humans  will  be  there ,COMMA experiencing  the  sun  's  demise ,COMMA but  any  life  and  intelligence  that  exists  then  will  be  as  different  from  us  as  we  are  from  bacteria .PERIOD the  unfolding  of  intelligence  and  complexity  still  has  immensely  far  to  go ,COMMA here  on  earth  and  probably  far  beyond .PERIOD so  we  are  still  at  the  beginning  of  the  emergence  of  complexity  in  our  earth  and  beyond .PERIOD if  you  represent  the  earth  's  lifetime  by  a  single  year ,COMMA say  from  january  when  it  was  made  to  december ,COMMA the  21st-century  would  be  a  quarter  of  a  second  in  june ,COMMA a  tiny  fraction  of  the  year .PERIOD but  even  in  this  concertinaed  cosmic  perspective ,COMMA our  century  is  very ,COMMA very  special .PERIOD the  first  when  humans  can  change  themselves  and  their  home  planet .PERIOD as  i  should  have  shown  this  earlier ,COMMA it  will  not  be  humans  who  witness  the  end  point  of  the  sun .PERIOD it  will  be  creatures  as  different  from  us  as  we  are  from  bacteria .PERIOD when  einstein  died  in  1955 ,COMMA one  striking  tribute  to  his  global  status  was  this  cartoon  by  herblock  in  the  washington  post .PERIOD the  plaque  reads ,COMMA albert  einstein  lived  here .PERIOD and  i'd  like  to  end  with  a  vignette ,COMMA as  it  were ,COMMA inspired  by  this  image .PERIOD we've  been  familiar  for  40  years  with  this  image ,COMMA the  fragile  beauty  of  land ,COMMA ocean  and  clouds ,COMMA contrasted

,COMMA not  just  for  40  years ,COMMA but  for  the  entire  45  billion-year  history  of  our  earth .PERIOD what  would  they  have  seen ?QUESTIONMARK over  nearly  all  that  immense  time ,COMMA earth  's  appearance  would  have  changed  very  gradually .PERIOD the  only  abrupt  worldwide  change  would  have  been  major  asteroid  impacts  or  volcanic  super-eruptions .PERIOD apart  from  those  brief  traumas ,COMMA nothing  happens  suddenly .PERIOD the  continental  landmasses  drifted  around .PERIOD ice  cover  waxed  and  waned .PERIOD successions  of  new  species

long  as  our  civilization ,COMMA but  for  civilization  to  survive ,COMMA we  'll  need  the  wisdom  of  the  old  einstein ,COMMA humane ,COMMA global  and  farseeing .PERIOD and  whatever  happens  in  this  uniquely  crucial  century  will  resonate  into  the  remote  future  and  perhaps  far  beyond  the  earth ,COMMA far  beyond  the  earth  as  depicted  here .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD good  afternoon .PERIOD there  's  a  medical  revolution  happening  all  around  us ,COMMA and  it  's  one  that  's  going  to  help  us  conquer  some  of  society  's  most  dreaded  conditions ,COMMA including  cancer .PERIOD the  revolution  is  called  angiogenesis ,COMMA and  it  's  based  on  the  process  that  our  bodies  use  to  grow  blood  vessels .PERIOD so  why  should  we  care  about  blood  vessels ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  human  body  is  literally  packed  with  them ,COMMA 60,000  miles  worth  in  a  typical  adult .PERIOD end  to  end ,COMMA that  would  form  a  line  that  would  circle  the  earth  twice .PERIOD the  smallest  blood  vessels  are  called  capillaries .PERIOD we've  got  19  billion  of  them  in  our  bodies .PERIOD and  these  are  the  vessels  of  life ,COMMA and ,COMMA as  i  'll  show  you ,COMMA they  can  also  be  the  vessels  of  death .PERIOD now  the  remarkable  thing  about  blood  vessels  is  that  they  have  this  ability  to  adapt  to  whatever  environment  they  're  growing  in .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA in  the  liver  they  form  channels  to  detoxify  the  blood .PERIOD in  the  lung  they  line  air  sacs  for  gas  exchange .PERIOD in  muscle  they  corkscrew  so  that  muscles  can  contract  without  cutting  off  circulation .PERIOD and  in  nerves  they  course  along  like  power  lines ,COMMA keeping  those  nerves  alive .PERIOD we  get  most  of  these  blood  vessels  when  we  're  actually  still  in  the  womb .PERIOD and  what  that  means  is  that  as  adults ,COMMA blood  vessels  do  n't  normally  grow .PERIOD except  in  a  few  special  circumstances: .PERIOD in  women ,COMMA blood  vessels  grow  every  month  to  build  the  lining  of  the  uterus .PERIOD during  pregnancy ,COMMA they  form  the  placenta ,COMMA which  connects  mom  and  baby .PERIOD and  after  injury ,COMMA blood  vessels  actually  have  to  grow  under  the  scab  in  order  to  heal  a  wound .PERIOD and  this  is  actually  what  it  looks  like .PERIOD hundreds  of  blood  vessels  all  growing  toward  the  center  of  the  wound .PERIOD so  the  body  has  the  ability  to  regulate  the  amount  of  blood  vessels  that  are  present  at  any  given  time .PERIOD it  does  this  through  an  elaborate  and  elegant  system  of  checks  and  balances ,COMMA stimulators  and  inhibitors  of  angiogenesis ,COMMA such  that ,COMMA when  we  need  a  brief  burst  of  blood  vessels ,COMMA the  body  can  do  this  by  releasing  stimulators ,COMMA proteins  called  angiogenic  factors  that  act  as  natural  fertilizer  and  stimulate  new  blood  vessels  to  sprout .PERIOD and  when  those  excess  vessels  are  no  longer  needed ,COMMA the  body  prunes  them  back  to  baseline  using  naturally  occurring  inhibitors  of  angiogenesis .PERIOD now  there  are  other  situations  where  we  start  beneath  the  baseline  and  we  need  to  grow  more  blood  vessels  just  to  get  back  to  normal  levels  -- .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA after  an  injury  -- .PERIOD and  a  body  can  do  that  too ,COMMA but  only  to  that  normal  level ,COMMA that  set  point .PERIOD but  what  we  now  know  is  that  for  a  number  of  diseases ,COMMA there  are  defects  in  the  system  where  the  body  cannot  prune  back  extra  blood  vessels  or  cannot  grow  enough  new  ones  in  the  right  place  at  the  right  time .PERIOD and  in  these  situations ,COMMA angiogenesis  is  out  of  balance .PERIOD and  when  angiogenesis  is  out  of  balance ,COMMA a  myriad  of  diseases  result .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA insufficient  angiogenesis ,COMMA not  enough  blood  vessels ,COMMA leads  to  wounds  that  do  n't  heal ,COMMA heart  attacks ,COMMA legs  without  circulation ,COMMA death  from  stroke ,COMMA nerve  damage .PERIOD and  on  the  other  end ,COMMA excessive  angiogenesis ,COMMA too  many  blood  vessels ,COMMA drives  disease .PERIOD and  we  see  this  in  cancer ,COMMA blindness ,COMMA arthritis ,COMMA obesity ,COMMA alzheimer  's  disease .PERIOD in  total ,COMMA there  are  more  than  70  major  diseases  affecting  more  than  a  billion  people  worldwide ,COMMA that  all  look  on  the  surface  to  be  different  from  one  another ,COMMA but  all  actually  share  abnormal  angiogenesis  as  their  common  denominator .PERIOD and  this  realization  is  allowing  us  to  reconceptualize  the  way  that  we  actually  approach  these  diseases  by  controlling  angiogenesis .PERIOD now  i  'm  going  to  focus  on  cancer  because  angiogenesis  is  a  hallmark  of  cancer ,COMMA every  type  of  cancer .PERIOD so  here  we  go .PERIOD this  is  a  tumor ,COMMA dark ,COMMA gray ,COMMA ominous  mass  growing  inside  a  brain .PERIOD and  under  the  microscope ,COMMA you  can  see  hundreds  of  these  brown  staining  blood  vessels ,COMMA capillaries  that  are  feeding  cancer  cells ,COMMA bringing  oxygen  and  nutrients .PERIOD but  cancers  do  n't  start  out  like  this .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA cancers  do  n't  start  out  with  a  blood  supply .PERIOD they  start  out  as  small ,COMMA microscopic  nests  of  cells  that  can  only  grow  to  one  half  a  cubic  millimeter  in  size .PERIOD that  's  the  tip  of  a  ballpoint  pen .PERIOD then  they  cannot  get  any  larger  because  they  do  n't  have  a  blood  supply ,COMMA so  they  do  n't  have  enough  oxygen  or  nutrients .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA we  're  probably  forming  these  microscopic  cancers  all  the  time  in  our  body .PERIOD autopsy  studies  from  people  who  died  in  car  accidents  have  shown  that  about  40  percent  of  women  between  the  ages  of  40  and  50  actually  have  microscopic  cancers  in  their  breasts .PERIOD about  50  percent  of  men  in  their  50s  and  60s  have  microscopic  prostate  cancers .PERIOD and  virtually  100  percent  of  us ,COMMA by  the  time  we  reach  our  70s ,COMMA will  have  microscopic  cancers  growing  in  our  thyroid .PERIOD yet ,COMMA without  a  blood  supply ,COMMA most  of  these  cancers  will  never  become  dangerous .PERIOD dr.  judah  folkman ,COMMA who  was  my  mentor  and  who  was  the  pioneer  of  the  angiogenesis  field ,COMMA once  called  this  cancer  without  disease .PERIOD so  the  body  's  ability  to  balance  angiogenesis ,COMMA when  it  's  working  properly ,COMMA prevents  blood  vessels  from  feeding  cancers .PERIOD and  this  turns  out  to  be  one  of  our  most  important  defense  mechanisms  against  cancer .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA if  you  actually  block  angiogenesis  and  prevent  blood  vessels  from  ever  reaching  cancer  cells ,COMMA tumors  simply  cannot  grow  up .PERIOD but  once  angiogenesis  occurs ,COMMA cancers  can  grow  exponentially .PERIOD and  this  is  actually  how  a  cancer  goes  from  being  harmless  to  deadly .PERIOD cancer  cells  mutate  and  they  gain  the  ability  to  release  lots  of  those  angiogenic  factors ,COMMA natural  fertilizer ,COMMA that  tip  the  balance  in  favor  of  blood  vessels  invading  the  cancer .PERIOD and  once  those  vessels  invade  the  cancer ,COMMA it  can  expand ,COMMA it  can  invade  local  tissues .PERIOD and  the  same  vessels  that  are  feeding  tumors  allow  cancer  cells  to  exit  into  the  circulation  as  metastases .PERIOD and ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA this  late  stage  of  cancer  is  the  one  at  which  it  's  most  likely  to  be  diagnosed ,COMMA when  angiogenesis  is  already  turned  on  and  cancer  cells  are  growing  like  wild .PERIOD so ,COMMA if  angiogenesis  is  a  tipping  point  between  a  harmless  cancer  and  a  harmful  one ,COMMA then  one  major  part  of  the  angiogenesis  revolution  is  a  new  approach  to  treating  cancer  by  cutting  off  the  blood  supply .PERIOD we  call  this  antiangiogenic  therapy ,COMMA and  it  's  completely  different  from  chemotherapy  because  it  selectively  aims  at  the  blood  vessels  that  are  feeding  the  cancers .PERIOD and  we  can  do  this  because  tumor  blood  vessels  are  unlike  normal ,COMMA healthy  vessels  we  see  in  other  places  of  the  body: .PERIOD they  're  abnormal .PERIOD they  're  very  poorly  constructed .PERIOD and ,COMMA because  of  that ,COMMA they  're  highly  vulnerable  to  treatments  that  target  them .PERIOD in  effect ,COMMA when  we  give  cancer  patients  antiangiogenic  therapy ,COMMA here ,COMMA an  experimental  drug  for  a  glioma ,COMMA which  is  a  type  of  brain  tumor ,COMMA you  can  see  that  there  are  dramatic  changes  that  occur  when  the  tumor  is  being  starved .PERIOD here  's  a  woman  with  a  breast  cancer  being  treated  with  the  antiangiogenic  drug  called  avastin ,COMMA which  is  fda  approved .PERIOD and  you  can  see  that  the  halo  of  blood  flow  disappears  after  treatment .PERIOD well ,COMMA i've  just  shown  you  two  very  different  types  of  cancer  that  both  responded  to  antiangiogenic  therapy .PERIOD so ,COMMA a  few  years  ago ,COMMA i  asked  myself ,COMMA can  we  take  this  one  step  further  and  treat  other  cancers ,COMMA even  in  other  species ?QUESTIONMARK so  here  is  a  nine  year-old  boxer  named  milo  who  had  a  very  aggressive  tumor  called  a  malignant  neurofibroma  growing  on  his  shoulder .PERIOD it  invaded  into  his  lungs .PERIOD his  veterinarian  only  gave  him  three  months  to  live .PERIOD so  we  created  a  cocktail  of  antiangiogenic  drugs  that  could  be  mixed  into  his  dog  food  as  well  as  an  antiangiogenic  cream  that  could  be  applied  on  the  surface  of  the  tumor .PERIOD and  within  a  few  weeks  of  treatment ,COMMA we  were  able  to  slow  down  that  cancer  's  growth  such  that  we  were  ultimately  able  to  extend  milo  's  survival  to  six  times  what  the  veterinarian  had  initially  predicted ,COMMA all  with  a  very  good  quality  of  life .PERIOD and  we  subsequently  treated  more  than  600  dogs .PERIOD we  have  about  a  60  percent  response  rate  and  improved  survival  for  these  pets  that  were  about  to  be  euthanized .PERIOD so  let  me  show  you  a  couple  of  even  more  interesting  examples .PERIOD this  is  20-year-old  dolphin  living  in  florida ,COMMA and  she  had  these  lesions  in  her  mouth  that ,COMMA over  the  course  of  three  years ,COMMA developed  into  invasive  squamous  cell  cancers .PERIOD so  we  created  an  antiangiogenic  paste .PERIOD we  had  it  painted  on  top  of  the  cancer  three  times  a  week .PERIOD and  over  the  course  of  seven  months ,COMMA the  cancers  completely  disappeared ,COMMA and  the  biopsies  came  back  as  normal .PERIOD here  's  a  cancer  growing  on  the  lip  of  a  wuarter  horse  named  guinness .PERIOD it  's  a  very ,COMMA very  deadly  type  of  cancer  called  an  angiosarcoma .PERIOD it  had  already  spread  to  his  lymph  nodes ,COMMA so  we  used  an  antiangiogenic  skin  cream  for  the  lip  and  an  oral  cocktail ,COMMA so  we  could  treat  from  the  inside  as  well  as  the  outside .PERIOD and  over  the  course  of  six  months ,COMMA he  experienced  a  complete  remission .PERIOD and  here  he  is  six  years  later ,COMMA guinness ,COMMA with  his  very  happy  owner .PERIOD now ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA antiangiogenic  therapy  could  be  used  for  a  wide  range  of  cancers .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA the  first  pioneering  treatments  for  people ,COMMA as  well  as  dogs ,COMMA are  already  becoming  available .PERIOD there  's  12  different  drugs ,COMMA 11  different  cancer  types .PERIOD but  the  real  question  is ,COMMA how  well  do  these  work  in  practice ?QUESTIONMARK so  here  's  actually  the  patient  survival  data  from  eight  different  types  of  cancer .PERIOD the  bars  represent  survival  time  taken  from  the  era  in  which  there  was  only  chemotherapy ,COMMA or  surgery ,COMMA or  radiation  available .PERIOD but  starting  in  2004 ,COMMA when  antiangiogenic  therapies  first  became  available ,COMMA well  you  can  see  that  there  has  been  a  70  to  100  percent  improvement  in  survival  for  people  with  kidney  cancer ,COMMA multiple  myeloma ,COMMA colorectal  cancer ,COMMA and  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumors .PERIOD that  's  impressive .PERIOD but  for  other  tumors  and  cancer  types ,COMMA the  improvements  have  only  been  modest .PERIOD so  i  started  asking  myself ,COMMA why  have  n't  we  been  able  to  do  better ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  answer ,COMMA to  me ,COMMA is  obvious .PERIOD we  're  treating  cancer  too  late  in  the  game ,COMMA when  it  's  already  established  and ,COMMA oftentimes ,COMMA it  's  already  spread  or  metastasized .PERIOD and  as  a  doctor ,COMMA i  know  that  once  a  disease  progresses  to  an  advanced  stage ,COMMA achieving  a  cure  can  be  difficult ,COMMA if  not  impossible .PERIOD so  i  went  back  to  the  biology  of  angiogenesis  and  started  thinking ,COMMA could  the  answer  to  cancer  be  preventing  angiogenesis ,COMMA beating  cancer  at  its  own  game  so  the  cancers  could  never  become  dangerous ?QUESTIONMARK this  could  help  healthy  people  as  well  as  people  who've  already  beaten  cancer  once  or  twice  and  want  to  find  a  way  to  keep  it  from  coming  back .PERIOD so  to  look  for  a  way  to  prevent  angiogenesis  in  cancer ,COMMA i  went  back  to  look  at  cancer  's  causes .PERIOD and  what  really  intrigued  me  was  when  i  saw  that  diet  accounts  for  30  to  35  percent  of  environmentally  caused  cancers .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  obvious  thing  is  to  think  about  what  we  could  remove  from  our  diet ,COMMA what  to  strip  out ,COMMA take  away .PERIOD but  i  actually  took  a  completely  opposite  approach  and  began  asking ,COMMA what  could  we  be  adding  to  our  diet  that  's  naturally  antiangiogenic ,COMMA that  could  boost  the  body  's  defense  system  and  beat  back  those  blood  vessels  that  are  feeding  cancers ?QUESTIONMARK in  other  words ,COMMA can  we  eat  to  starve  cancer ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  answer  's  yes .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  show  you  how .PERIOD our  search  for  this  has  taken  us  to  the  market ,COMMA the  farm  and  to  the  spice  cabinet ,COMMA because  what  we've  discovered  is  that  mother  nature  has  laced  a  large  number  of  foods  and  beverages  and  herbs  with  naturally  occurring  inhibitors  of  angiogenesis .PERIOD so  here  's  a  test  system  we  developed .PERIOD at  the  center  is  a  ring  from  which  hundreds  of  blood  vessels  are  growing  out  in  a  starburst  fashion .PERIOD and  we  can  use  this  system  to  test  dietary  factors  at  concentrations  that  are  obtainable  by  eating .PERIOD so  let  me  show  you  what  happens  when  we  put  in  an  extract  from  red  grapes .PERIOD the  active  ingredient  's  resveratrol .PERIOD it  's  also  found  in  red  wine .PERIOD this  inhibits  abnormal  angiogenesis  by  60  percent .PERIOD here  's  what  happens  when  we  added  an  extract  from  strawberries .PERIOD it  potently  inhibits  angiogenesis .PERIOD and  extract  from  soybeans .PERIOD and  here  is  a  growing  list  of  our  antiangiogenic  foods  and  beverages  that  we  're  interested  in  studying .PERIOD for  each  food  type ,COMMA we  believe  that  there  are  different  potencies  within  different  strains  and  varietals .PERIOD and  we  want  to  measure  this  because ,COMMA well ,COMMA while  you  're  eating  a  strawberry  or  drinking  tea ,COMMA why  not  select  the  one  that  's  most  potent  for  preventing  cancer .PERIOD so  here  are  four  different  teas  that  we've  tested .PERIOD they  're  all  common  ones ,COMMA chinese  jasmine ,COMMA japanese  sencha ,COMMA earl  grey  and  a  special  blend  that  we  prepared .PERIOD and  you  can  see  clearly  that  the  teas  vary  in  their  potency  from  less  potent  to  more  potent .PERIOD but  what  's  very  cool  is  when  we  actually  combined  the  two  less  potent  teas  together ,COMMA the  combination ,COMMA the  blend ,COMMA is  more  potent  than  either  one  alone .PERIOD this  means  there  's  food  synergy .PERIOD here  's  some  more  data  from  our  testing .PERIOD now ,COMMA in  the  lab ,COMMA we  can  simulate  tumor  angiogenesis  represented  here  in  a  black  bar .PERIOD and  using  this  system ,COMMA we  can  test  the  potency  of  cancer  drugs .PERIOD so  the  shorter  the  bar ,COMMA less  angiogenesis ,COMMA that  's  good .PERIOD and  here  are  some  common  drugs  that  have  been  associated  with  reducing  the  risk  of  cancer  in  people .PERIOD statins ,COMMA nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  and  a  few  others ,COMMA they  inhibit  angiogenesis  too .PERIOD and  here  are  the  dietary  factors  going  head  to  head  against  these  drugs .PERIOD you  can  see ,COMMA they  clearly  hold  their  own  and ,COMMA in  some  cases ,COMMA they  're  more  potent  than  the  actual  drugs .PERIOD soy ,COMMA parsley ,COMMA garlic ,COMMA grapes ,COMMA berries .PERIOD i  could  go  home  and  cook  a  tasty  meal  using  these  ingredients .PERIOD so  imagine  if  we  could  create  the  world  's  first  rating  system  in  which  we  could  score  foods  according  to  their  antiangiogenic ,COMMA cancer-preventative  properties .PERIOD and  that  's  what  we  're  doing  right  now .PERIOD now ,COMMA i've  shown  you  a  bunch  of  lab  data ,COMMA and  so  the  real  question  is ,COMMA what  is  the  evidence  in  people  that  eating  certain  foods  can  reduce  angiogenesis  in  cancer ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  best  example  i  know  is  a  study  of  79,000  men  followed  over  20  years ,COMMA in  which  it  was  found  that  men  who  consumed  cooked  tomatoes  two  to  three  times  a  week  had  up  to  a  50  percent  reduction  in  their  risk  of  developing  prostate  cancer .PERIOD now ,COMMA we  know  that  tomatoes  are  a  good  source  of  lycopene ,COMMA and  lycopene  is  antiangiogenic .PERIOD but  what  's  even  more  interesting  from  this  study  is  that  in  those  men  who  did  develop  prostate  cancer ,COMMA those  who  ate  more  servings  of  tomato  sauce  actually  had  fewer  blood  vessels  feeding  their  cancer .PERIOD so  this  human  study  is  a  prime  example  of  how  antiangiogenic  substances  present  in  food  and  consumed  at  practical  levels  can  impact  on  cancer .PERIOD and  we  're  now  studying  the  role  of  a  healthy  diet  with  dean  ornish  at  ucsf  and  tufts  university  on  the  role  of  this  healthy  diet  on  markers  of  angiogenesis  that  we  can  find  in  the  bloodstream .PERIOD now ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA what  i've  shared  with  you  has  some  far-ranging  implications ,COMMA even  beyond  cancer  research .PERIOD because  if  we  're  right ,COMMA it  could  impact  on  consumer  education ,COMMA food  services ,COMMA public  health  and  even  the  insurance  industry .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA some  insurance  companies  are  already  beginning  to  think  along  these  lines .PERIOD check  out  this  ad  from  blue  cross  blue  shield  of  minnesota .PERIOD and  for  many  people  around  the  world ,COMMA dietary  cancer  prevention  may  be  the  only  practical  solution  because  not  everybody  can  afford  expensive  end-stage  cancer  treatments ,COMMA but  everybody  could  benefit  from  a  healthy  diet  based  on  local ,COMMA sustainable ,COMMA antiangiogenic  crops .PERIOD now ,COMMA finally ,COMMA i've  talked  to  you  about  food ,COMMA and  i've  talked  to  you  about  cancer ,COMMA so  there  's  just  one  more  disease  that  i  have  to  tell  you  about  and  that  's  obesity .PERIOD because  it  turns  out  that  adipose  tissue ,COMMA fat ,COMMA is  highly  angiogenesis  dependent .PERIOD and ,COMMA like  a  tumor ,COMMA fat  grows  when  blood  vessels  grow .PERIOD so  the  question  is ,COMMA can  we  shrink  fat  by  cutting  off  its  blood  supply ?QUESTIONMARK so  the  top  curve  shows  the  body  weight  of  a  genetically  obese  mouse  that  eats  nonstop  until  it  turns  fat ,COMMA like  this  furry  tennis  ball .PERIOD and  the  bottom  curve  is  the  weight  of  a  normal  mouse .PERIOD if  you  take  the  obese  mouse  and  give  it  an  angiogenesis  inhibitor ,COMMA it  loses  weight .PERIOD stop  the  treatment ,COMMA gains  the  weight  back .PERIOD restart  the  treatment ,COMMA loses  the  weight  again .PERIOD stop  the  treatment ,COMMA it  gains  the  weight  back .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA you  can  cycle  the  weight  up  and  down  simply  by  inhibiting  angiogenesis .PERIOD so  this  approach  that  we  're  taking  for  cancer  prevention  may  also  have  an  application  for  obesity .PERIOD the  really ,COMMA truly  interesting  thing  about  this  is  that  we  cannot  take  these  obese  mice  and  make  them  lose  more  weight  than  what  the  normal  mouse  's  weight  is  supposed  to  be .PERIOD in  other  words ,COMMA we  cannot  create  supermodel  mice .PERIOD and  this  speaks  to  the  role  of  angiogenesis  in  regulating  healthy  set  points .PERIOD albert  szent-gyorgi  once  said  that ,COMMA discovery  consists  of  seeing  what  everyone  has  seen ,COMMA and  thinking  what  no  one  has  thought .PERIOD i  hope  i've  convinced  you  that ,COMMA for  diseases  like  cancer ,COMMA obesity  and  other  conditions ,COMMA that  there  may  be  a  great  power  in  attacking  their  common  denominator ,COMMA angiogenesis .PERIOD and  that  's  what  i  think  the  world  needs  now .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD june  cohen ,COMMA i  have  a  quick  question  for  you .PERIOD so  these  drugs  are  n't  exactly .PERIOD they  're  not  exactly  in  mainstream  cancer  treatments  right  now .PERIOD for  anyone  out  here  who  has  cancer ,COMMA what  would  you  recommend ?QUESTIONMARK do  you  recommend  pursuing  these  treatments  now ,COMMA for  most  cancer  patients ?QUESTIONMARK william  li ,COMMA so  there  are  antiangiogenic  treatments  that  are  fda  approved .PERIOD and  if  you  're  a  cancer  patient  or  working  for  one  or  advocating  for  one ,COMMA you  should  ask  about  them .PERIOD and  there  are  many  clinical  trials .PERIOD the  angiogenesis  foundation  is  following  almost  300  companies ,COMMA and  there  are  about  100  more  drugs  in  that  pipeline .PERIOD so  consider  the  approved  ones ,COMMA look  for  clinical  trials ,COMMA but  then  between  what  the  doctor  can  do  for  you ,COMMA we  need  to  start  asking  what  can  we  do  for  ourselves .PERIOD and  this  is  one  of  the  themes  that  i  'm  talking  about  is  we  can  empower  ourselves  to  do  the  things  that  doctors  cannot  do  for  us ,COMMA which  is  to  use  knowledge  and  take  action .PERIOD and  if  mother  nature  has  given  us  some  clues ,COMMA we  think  that  there  might  be  a  new  future  in  the  value  of  how  we  eat .PERIOD and  what  we  eat  is  really  our  chemotherapy  three  times  a  day .PERIOD jc ,COMMA right .PERIOD and  along  those  lines ,COMMA for  people  who  might  have  risk  factors  for  cancer ,COMMA would  you  recommend  pursuing  any  treatments  sort  of  prophylactically  or  simply  pursuing  the  right  diet  with  lots  of  tomato  sauce ?QUESTIONMARK wl ,COMMA well ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA there  's  abundant  epidemiological  evidence .PERIOD and  i  think  in  the  information  age ,COMMA it  does  n't  take  long  to  go  to  a  credible  source  like  pubmed ,COMMA the  national  library  of  medicine ,COMMA to  look  for  epidemiological  studies  for  cancer  risk  reduction  based  on  diet  and  based  on  common  medications .PERIOD and  that  's  certainly  something  that  anybody  can  look  into .PERIOD jc ,COMMA okay .PERIOD well ,COMMA thank  you  so  much .PERIOD so  for  any  of  us  in  this  room  today ,COMMA let  's  start  out  by  admitting  we  're  lucky .PERIOD we  do  n't  live  in  the  world  our  mothers  lived  in ,COMMA our  grandmothers  lived  in ,COMMA where  career  choices  for  women  were  so  limited .PERIOD and  if  you  're  in  this  room  today ,COMMA most  of  us  grew  up  in  a  world  where  we  had  basic  civil  rights .PERIOD and  amazingly ,COMMA we  still  live  in  a  world  where  some  women  do  n't  have  them .PERIOD but  all  that  aside ,COMMA we  still  have  a  problem ,COMMA and  it  's  a  real  problem .PERIOD and  the  problem  is  this ,COMMA women  are  not  making  it  to  the  top  of  any  profession  anywhere  in  the  world .PERIOD the  numbers  tell  the  story  quite  clearly .PERIOD 190  heads  of  state ,COMMA nine  are  women .PERIOD of  all  the  people  in  parliament  in  the  world ,COMMA 13  percent  are  women .PERIOD in  the  corporate  sector ,COMMA women  at  the  top ,COMMA c-level  jobs ,COMMA board  seats ,COMMA tops  out  at  15 ,COMMA 16  percent .PERIOD the  numbers  have  not  moved  since  2002  and  are  going  in  the  wrong  direction .PERIOD and  even  in  the  non-profit  world ,COMMA a  world  we  sometimes  think  of  as  being  led  by  more  women ,COMMA women  at  the  top ,COMMA 20  percent .PERIOD we  also  have  another  problem ,COMMA which  is  that  women  face  harder  choices  between  professional  success  and  personal  fulfillment .PERIOD a  recent  study  in  the  us .PERIOD showed  that ,COMMA of  married  senior  managers ,COMMA two-thirds  of  the  married  men  had  children  and  only  one-third  of  the  married  women  had  children .PERIOD a  couple  of  years  ago ,COMMA i  was  in  new  york ,COMMA and  i  was  pitching  a  deal ,COMMA and  i  was  in  one  of  those  fancy  new  york  private  equity  offices  you  can  picture .PERIOD and  i  'm  in  the  meeting ,COMMA it  's  about  a  three-hour  meeting ,COMMA and  two  hours  in ,COMMA there  kind  of  needs  to  be  that  bio  break ,COMMA and  everyone  stands  up ,COMMA and  the  partner  running  the  meeting  starts  looking  really  embarrassed .PERIOD and  i  realized  he  does  n't  know  where  the  women  's  room  is  in  his  office .PERIOD so  i  start  looking  around  for  moving  boxes ,COMMA figuring  they  just  moved  in ,COMMA but  i  do  n't  see  any .PERIOD and  so  i  said ,COMMA did  you  just  move  into  this  office ?QUESTIONMARK and  he  said ,COMMA no ,COMMA we've  been  here  about  a  year .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA are  you  telling  me  that  i  am  the  only  woman  to  have  pitched  a  deal  in  this  office  in  a  year ?QUESTIONMARK and  he  looked  at  me ,COMMA and  he  said ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD or  maybe  you  're  the  only  one  who  had  to  go  to  the  bathroom .PERIOD so  the  question  is ,COMMA how  are  we  going  to  fix  this ?QUESTIONMARK how  do  we  change  these  numbers  at  the  top ?QUESTIONMARK how  do  we  make  this  different ?QUESTIONMARK i  want  to  start  out  by  saying ,COMMA i  talk  about  this ,COMMA about  keeping  women  in  the  workforce ,COMMA because  i  really  think  that  's  the  answer .PERIOD in  the  high-income  part  of  our  workforce ,COMMA in  the  people  who  end  up  at  the  top ,COMMA fortune  500  ceo  jobs ,COMMA or  the  equivalent  in  other  industries ,COMMA the  problem ,COMMA i  am  convinced ,COMMA is  that  women  are  dropping  out .PERIOD now  people  talk  about  this  a  lot ,COMMA and  they  talk  about  things  like  flextime  and  mentoring  and  programs  companies  should  have  to  train  women .PERIOD i  want  to  talk  about  none  of  that  today ,COMMA even  though  that  's  all  really  important .PERIOD today  i  want  to  focus  on  what  we  can  do  as  individuals .PERIOD what  are  the  messages  we  need  to  tell  ourselves ?QUESTIONMARK what  are  the  messages  we  tell  the  women  who  work  with  and  for  us ?QUESTIONMARK what  are  the  messages  we  tell  our  daughters ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA at  the  outset ,COMMA i  want  to  be  very  clear  that  this  speech  comes  with  no  judgments .PERIOD i  do  n't  have  the  right  answer .PERIOD i  do  n't  even  have  it  for  myself .PERIOD i  left  san  francisco ,COMMA where  i  live ,COMMA on  monday ,COMMA and  i  was  getting  on  the  plane  for  this  conference .PERIOD and  my  daughter ,COMMA who  's  three ,COMMA when  i  dropped  her  off  at  preschool ,COMMA did  that  whole  hugging-the-leg ,COMMA crying ,COMMA mommy ,COMMA do  n't  get  on  the  plane  thing .PERIOD this  is  hard .PERIOD i  feel  guilty  sometimes .PERIOD i  know  no  women ,COMMA whether  they  're  at  home  or  whether  they  're  in  the  workforce ,COMMA who  do  n't  feel  that  sometimes .PERIOD so  i  'm  not  saying  that  staying  in  the  workforce  is  the  right  thing  for  everyone .PERIOD my  talk  today  is  about  what  the  messages  are  if  you  do  want  to  stay  in  the  workforce .PERIOD and  i  think  there  are  three .PERIOD one ,COMMA sit  at  the  table .PERIOD two ,COMMA make  your  partner  a  real  partner .PERIOD and  three ,COMMA do  n't  leave  before  you  leave .PERIOD number  one ,COMMA sit  at  the  table .PERIOD just  a  couple  weeks  ago  at  facebook ,COMMA we  hosted  a  very  senior  government  official ,COMMA and  he  came  in  to  meet  with  senior  execs  from  around  silicon  valley .PERIOD and  everyone  kind  of  sat  at  the  table .PERIOD and  then  he  had  these  two  women  who  were  traveling  with  him  who  were  pretty  senior  in  his  department .PERIOD and  i  kind  of  said  to  them ,COMMA sit  at  the  table .PERIOD come  on ,COMMA sit  at  the  table .PERIOD and  they  sat  on  the  side  of  the  room .PERIOD when  i  was  in  college  my  senior  year ,COMMA i  took  a  course  called  european  intellectual  history .PERIOD do  n't  you  love  that  kind  of  thing  from  college ?QUESTIONMARK i  wish  i  could  do  that  now .PERIOD and  i  took  it  with  my  roommate ,COMMA carrie ,COMMA who  was  then  a  brilliant  literary  student ,COMMA and  went  on  to  be  a  brilliant  literary  scholar ,COMMA and  my  brother ,COMMA smart  guy ,COMMA but  a  water-polo-playing  pre-med ,COMMA who  was  a  sophomore .PERIOD the  three  of  us  take  this  class  together .PERIOD and  then  carrie  reads  all  the  books  in  the  original  greek  and  latin ,COMMA goes  to  all  the  lectures .PERIOD i  read  all  the  books  in  english  and  go  to  most  of  the  lectures .PERIOD my  brother  is  kind  of  busy .PERIOD he  reads  one  book  of  12  and  goes  to  a  couple  of  lectures ,COMMA marches  himself  up  to  our  room  a  couple  days  before  the  exam  to  get  himself  tutored .PERIOD the  three  of  us  go  to  the  exam  together ,COMMA and  we  sit  down .PERIOD and  we  sit  there  for  three  hours ,COMMA and  our  little  blue  notebooks ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i  'm  that  old .PERIOD and  we  walk  out ,COMMA and  we  look  at  each  other ,COMMA and  we  say ,COMMA how  did  you  do ?QUESTIONMARK and  carrie  says ,COMMA boy ,COMMA i  feel  like  i  did  n't  really  draw  out  the  main  point  on  the  hegelian  dialectic .PERIOD and  i  say ,COMMA god ,COMMA i  really  wish  i  had  really  connected  john  locke  's  theory  of  property  with  the  philosophers  who  follow .PERIOD and  my  brother  says ,COMMA i  got  the  top  grade  in  the  class .PERIOD you  got  the  top  grade  in  the  class ?QUESTIONMARK you  do  n't  know  anything .PERIOD the  problem  with  these  stories  is  that  they  show  what  the  data  shows ,COMMA women  systematically  underestimate  their  own  abilities .PERIOD if  you  test  men  and  women ,COMMA and  you  ask  them  questions  on  totally  objective  criteria  like  gpas ,COMMA men  get  it  wrong  slightly  high ,COMMA and  women  get  it  wrong  slightly  low .PERIOD women  do  not  negotiate  for  themselves  in  the  workforce .PERIOD a  study  in  the  last  two  years  of  people  entering  the  workforce  out  of  college  showed  that  57  percent  of  boys  entering ,COMMA or  men ,COMMA i  guess ,COMMA are  negotiating  their  first  salary ,COMMA and  only  seven  percent  of  women .PERIOD and  most  importantly ,COMMA men  attribute  their  success  to  themselves ,COMMA and  women  attribute  it  to  other  external  factors .PERIOD if  you  ask  men  why  they  did  a  good  job ,COMMA they  'll  say ,COMMA i  'm  awesome .PERIOD obviously .PERIOD why  are  you  even  asking ?QUESTIONMARK if  you  ask  women  why  they  did  a  good  job ,COMMA what  they  'll  say  is  someone  helped  them ,COMMA they  got  lucky ,COMMA they  worked  really  hard .PERIOD why  does  this  matter ?QUESTIONMARK boy ,COMMA it  matters  a  lot  because  no  one  gets  to  the  corner  office  by  sitting  on  the  side ,COMMA not  at  the  table .PERIOD and  no  one  gets  the  promotion  if  they  do  n't  think  they  deserve  their  success .PERIOD or  they  do  n't  even  understand  their  own  success .PERIOD i  wish  the  answer  were  easy .PERIOD i  wish  i  could  just  go  tell  all  the  young  women  i  work  for ,COMMA all  these  fabulous  women ,COMMA believe  in  yourself  and  negotiate  for  yourself .PERIOD own  your  own  success .PERIOD i  wish  i  could  tell  that  to  my  daughter .PERIOD but  it  's  not  that  simple .PERIOD because  what  the  data  shows ,COMMA above  all  else ,COMMA is  one  thing ,COMMA which  is  that  success  and  likeability  are  positively  correlated  for  men  and  negatively  correlated  for  women .PERIOD and  everyone  's  nodding ,COMMA because  we  all  know  this  to  be  true .PERIOD there  's  a  really  good  study  that  shows  this  really  well .PERIOD there  's  a  famous  harvard  business  school  study  on

?QUESTIONMARK not  so  sure .PERIOD she  's  a  little  out  for  herself .PERIOD she  's  a  little  political .PERIOD you  're  not  sure  you'd  want  to  work  for  her .PERIOD this  is  the

at  the  table .PERIOD and  we  have  to  do  it  in  a  world  where ,COMMA for  them ,COMMA there  are  sacrifices  they  will  make  for  that ,COMMA even  though  for  their  brothers ,COMMA there  are  not .PERIOD the  saddest  thing  about  all  of  this  is  that  it  's  really  hard  to  remember  this .PERIOD and  i  'm  about  to  tell  a  story  which  is  truly  embarrassing  for  me ,COMMA but  i  think  important .PERIOD i  gave  this  talk  at  facebook  not  so  long  ago  to  about  100  employees .PERIOD and  a  couple  hours  later ,COMMA there  was  a  young  woman  who

,COMMA and  you  said  you  were  going  to  take  two  more  questions .PERIOD and  i  had  my  hand  up  with  lots  of  other  people ,COMMA and  you  took  two  more  questions .PERIOD and  i  put  my  hand  down ,COMMA and  i  noticed  all  the  women  put  their  hand  down .PERIOD and  then  you  took  more  questions ,COMMA only  from  the  men .PERIOD and  i  thought  to  myself ,COMMA wow ,COMMA if  it  's  me ,COMMA who  cares  about  this ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA giving  this  talk ,COMMA and  during  this  talk ,COMMA i  cannot  even  notice  that  the  men  's  hands  are  still  raised ,COMMA and  the  women  's  hands  are  still  raised ,COMMA how  good  are  we  as  managers  of  our  companies  and  our  organizations  at  seeing  that  the  men  are  reaching  for  opportunities  more  than  women ?QUESTIONMARK we've  got  to  get  women  to  sit  at  the  table .PERIOD message  number  two ,COMMA make  your  partner  a  real  partner .PERIOD i've  become  convinced  that  we've  made  more  progress  in  the  workforce  than  we  have  in  the  home .PERIOD the  data  shows  this  very  clearly .PERIOD if  a  woman  and  a  man  work  full-time  and

complicated ,COMMA and  i  do  n't  have  time  to  go  into  them .PERIOD and  i  do  n't  think  sunday  football-watching  and  general  laziness  is  the  cause .PERIOD i  think  the  cause  is  more  complicated .PERIOD i  think ,COMMA as  a  society ,COMMA we  put  more  pressure  on  our  boys  to  succeed  than  we  do  on  our  girls .PERIOD i  know  men  that  stay  home  and  work  in

do  n't  play  with  him .PERIOD and  that  's  a  problem ,COMMA because  we  have  to  make  it  as  important  a  job ,COMMA because  it  's  the  hardest  job  in  the  world  to  work  inside

shall  i  say  this  on  this  stage ,COMMA they  know  each  other  more  in  the  biblical  sense  as  well .PERIOD message  number  three ,COMMA do  n't  leave  before  you  leave .PERIOD i  think  there  's  a  really  deep  irony  to  the  fact  that  actions  women  are  taking ,COMMA and  i  see  this  all  the  time ,COMMA with  the  objective  of  staying  in  the  workforce  actually

been  picking  on  the  other .PERIOD so  it  's  about  time  that  we  talked  about  how  the  computer  ambushed  television .PERIOD or  why  the  invention  of  the  atomic  bomb  unleashed  forces  that  lead  to  the  writers  strike .PERIOD and  it  's  not  just  what  these  are  doing  to  each  other ,COMMA but  it  's  what  the  audience  thinks  that  really  frames  this

like ,COMMA not  necessary  because  you  can  do  a  lot  of  other  stuff  with  your  free  time  than  watch  programs .PERIOD peter  hirshberg ,COMMA which  is  more  fun ,COMMA internet  or  tv ?QUESTIONMARK girls ,COMMA internet .PERIOD girl  2 ,COMMA i  think  we ,COMMA the  reasons ,COMMA one  of  the  reasons  we  put  computer  before  tv  is  because  nowadays ,COMMA like ,COMMA we  have  tv  shows  on  the  computer .PERIOD girl  2 ,COMMA and  then  you  can  download  onto  your  ipod .PERIOD ph ,COMMA would  you  like  to  be  the  president  of  a  tv  network ?QUESTIONMARK

going  to  lose  all  their  money  eventually .PERIOD girl  3 ,COMMA like  the  stock  market ,COMMA it  goes  up  and  down  and  stuff .PERIOD i  think  right  now  the  computers  will  be  at  the  top  and  everything  will  be  kind  of  going  down  and  stuff .PERIOD ph ,COMMA there  's  been  an  uneasy  relationship  between  the  tv  business  and  the  tech  business ,COMMA really  ever  since  they  both  turned  about  30 .PERIOD we  go  through  periods  of  enthrallment ,COMMA followed  by  reactions  in  boardrooms ,COMMA in  the  finance  community  best  characterized  as ,COMMA what  's  the  finance  term ?QUESTIONMARK ick  pooey .PERIOD let  me  give  you  an  example  of  this .PERIOD the  year  is  1976 ,COMMA and  warner  buys  atari  because  video  games  are  on  the  rise .PERIOD the  next  year  they  march  forward  and  they  introduce  qube ,COMMA the  first  interactive  cable  tv  system ,COMMA and  the  new  york  times  heralds  this  as

that  summer  i  'm  all ,COMMA i  'm  at  warner  that  summer ,COMMA i  'm  all  excited  to  work  on  convergence ,COMMA and  then  the  bottom  falls  out .PERIOD does  n't  work  out  too  well  for  them ,COMMA they  lose  money .PERIOD and  i  had  a  happy  brush  with  convergence  until ,COMMA kind  of ,COMMA warner  basically  has  to  liquidate  the  whole  thing .PERIOD that  's  when  i  leave  graduate  school ,COMMA and  i  cannot  work  in  new  york  on  kind  of  entertainment  and  technology  because  i  have  to  be  exiled  to  california ,COMMA where  the  remaining  jobs  are ,COMMA almost  to  the  sea ,COMMA to  go  to  work  for  apple  computer .PERIOD warner ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA writes  off  more  than  400  million  dollars .PERIOD four  hundred  million  dollars ,COMMA which  was  real  money  back  in  the  70s .PERIOD but  they  were  onto  something  and  they  got  better  at  it .PERIOD by  the  year  2000 ,COMMA the  process  was  perfected .PERIOD they  merged  with  aol ,COMMA and  in  just  four  years ,COMMA managed  to  shed  about  200  billion  dollars  of  market  capitalization ,COMMA showing  that  they'd  actually  mastered  the  art  of  applying  moore  's  law  of  successive  miniaturization  to  their  balance  sheet .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  think  that  one  reason  that  the  media  and  the  entertainment  communities ,COMMA or  the  media  community ,COMMA is  driven  so  crazy  by  the  tech  community  is  that  tech  folks  talk  differently .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA for  50  years ,COMMA we've  talked  about  changing  the  world ,COMMA about  total  transformation .PERIOD for  50  years ,COMMA it  's  been  about  hopes  and  fears  and  promises  of  a  better  world .PERIOD and  i  got  to  thinking ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA who  else  talks  that  way ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  answer  is  pretty  clearly ,COMMA it  's  people  in  religion  and  in  politics .PERIOD and  so  i  realized  that  actually  the  tech  world  is  best  understood ,COMMA not  as  a  business  cycle ,COMMA but  as  a  messianic  movement .PERIOD we  promise  something  great ,COMMA we  evangelize  it ,COMMA we  're  going  to  change  the  world .PERIOD it  does  n't  work  out  too  well ,COMMA and  so  we  actually  go  back  to  the  well  and  start  all  over  again ,COMMA as  the  people  in  new  york  and  la .PERIOD look  on  in  absolute ,COMMA morbid  astonishment .PERIOD but  it  's  this  irrational  view  of  things  that  drives  us  on  to  the  next  thing .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  i'd  like  to  ask  is ,COMMA if  the  computer  is  becoming  a  principal  tool  of  media  and  entertainment ,COMMA how  did  we  get  here ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA how  did  a  machine  that  was  built  for  accounting  and  artillery  morph  into  media ?QUESTIONMARK of  course ,COMMA the  first  computer  was  built  just  after  world  war  ii  to  solve  military  problems ,COMMA but  things  got  really  interesting  just  a  couple  of  years  later ,COMMA 1949  with  whirlwind .PERIOD built  at  mit  's  lincoln  lab .PERIOD jay  forrester  was  building  this  for  the  navy ,COMMA but  you  cannot  help  but  see  that  the  creator  of  this  machine  had  in  mind  a  machine  that  might  actually  be  a  potential  media  star .PERIOD so  take  a  look  at  what  happens  when  the  foremost  journalist  of  early  television  meets  one  of  the  foremost  computer  pioneers ,COMMA and  the  computer  begins  to  express  itself .PERIOD journalist ,COMMA it  's  a  whirlwind  electronic  computer .PERIOD with  considerable  trepidation ,COMMA we  undertake  to  interview  this  new  machine .PERIOD jay  forrester ,COMMA hello  new  york ,COMMA this  is  cambridge .PERIOD and  this  is  the  oscilloscope  of  the  whirlwind  electronic  computer .PERIOD would  you  like  if  i  used  the  machine ?QUESTIONMARK journalist ,COMMA yes ,COMMA of  course .PERIOD but  i  have  an  idea ,COMMA mr.  forrester .PERIOD since  this  computer  was  made  in  conjunction  with  the  office  of  naval  research ,COMMA why  do  n't  we  switch  down  to  the  pentagon  in  washington  and  let  the  navy  's  research  chief ,COMMA admiral  bolster ,COMMA give  whirlwind  the  workout ?QUESTIONMARK calvin  bolster ,COMMA well ,COMMA ed ,COMMA this  problem  concerns  the  navy  's  viking  rocket .PERIOD this  rocket  goes  up  135  miles  into  the  sky .PERIOD now ,COMMA at  the  standard  rate  of  fuel  consumption ,COMMA i  would  like  to  see  the  computer  trace  the  flight  path  of  this  rocket  and  see  how  it  can  determine ,COMMA at  any  instant ,COMMA say  at  the  end  of  40  seconds ,COMMA the  amount  of  fuel  remaining ,COMMA and  the  velocity  at  that  set  instant .PERIOD jf ,COMMA over  on  the  left-hand  side ,COMMA you  will  notice  fuel  consumption  decreasing  as  the  rocket  takes  off .PERIOD and  on  the  right-hand  side ,COMMA there  's  a  scale  that  shows  the  rocket  's  velocity .PERIOD the  rocket  's  position  is  shown  by  the  trajectory  that  we  're  now  looking  at .PERIOD and  as  it  reaches  the  peak  of  its  trajectory ,COMMA the  velocity ,COMMA you  will  notice ,COMMA has  dropped  off  to  a  minimum .PERIOD then ,COMMA as  the  rocket  dives  down ,COMMA velocity  picks  up  again  toward  a  maximum  velocity  and  the  rocket  hits  the  ground .PERIOD how  's  that ?QUESTIONMARK journalist ,COMMA what  about  that ,COMMA admiral ?QUESTIONMARK cb ,COMMA looks  very  good  to  me .PERIOD jf ,COMMA and  before  leaving ,COMMA we  would  like  to  show  you  another  kind  of  mathematical  problem  that  some  of  the  boys  have  worked  out  in  their  spare  time ,COMMA in  a  less  serious  vein ,COMMA for  a  sunday  afternoon .PERIOD journalist ,COMMA thank  you  very  much  indeed ,COMMA mr.  forrester  and  the  mit  lab .PERIOD ph ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA so  much  was  worked  out ,COMMA the  first  real-time  interaction ,COMMA the  video  display ,COMMA pointing  a  gun .PERIOD it  lead  to  the  microcomputer ,COMMA but  unfortunately ,COMMA it  was  too  pricey  for  the  navy ,COMMA and  all  of  this  would  have  been  lost  if  it  were  n't  for  a  happy  coincidence .PERIOD enter  the  atomic  bomb .PERIOD we  're  threatened  by  the  greatest  weapon  ever ,COMMA and  knowing  a  good  thing  when  it  sees  it ,COMMA the  air  force  decides  it  needs  the  biggest  computer  ever  to  protect  us .PERIOD they  adapt  whirlwind  to  a  massive  air  defense  system ,COMMA deploy  it  all  across  the  frozen  north ,COMMA and  spend  nearly  three  times  as  much  on  this  computer  as  was  spent  on  the  manhattan  project  building  the  a-bomb  in  the  first  place .PERIOD talk  about  a  shot  in  the  arm  for  the  computer  industry .PERIOD and  you  can  imagine  that  the  air  force  became  a  pretty  good  salesman .PERIOD here  's  their  marketing  video .PERIOD narrator ,COMMA in  a  mass  raid ,COMMA high-speed  bombers  could  be  in  on  us  before  we  could  determine  their  tracks .PERIOD and  then  it  would  be  too  late  to  act .PERIOD we  cannot  afford  to  take  that  chance .PERIOD it  is  to  meet  this  threat  that  the  air  force  has  been  developing  sage ,COMMA the  semi-automatic  ground  environment  system ,COMMA to  strengthen  our  air  defenses .PERIOD this  new  computer ,COMMA built  to  become  the  nerve  center  of  a  defense  network ,COMMA is  able  to  perform  all  the  complex  mathematical  problems  involved  in  countering  a  mass  enemy  raid .PERIOD it  is  provided  with  its  own  powerhouse  containing  large  diesel-driven  generators ,COMMA air-conditioning  equipment ,COMMA and  cooling  towers  required  to  cool  the  thousands  of  vacuum  tubes  in  the  computer .PERIOD ph ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA that  one  computer  was  huge .PERIOD there  's  an  interesting  marketing  lesson  from  it ,COMMA which  is  basically ,COMMA when  you  market  a  product ,COMMA you  can  either  say ,COMMA this  is  going  to  be  wonderful ,COMMA it  will  make  you  feel  better  and  enliven  you .PERIOD or  there  's  one  other  marketing  proposition ,COMMA if  you  do  n't  use  our  product ,COMMA you  'll  die .PERIOD this  is  a  really  good  example  of  that .PERIOD this  had  the  first  pointing  device .PERIOD it  was  distributed ,COMMA so  it  worked  out ,COMMA distributed  computing  and  modems ,COMMA so  all  these  things  could  talk  to  each  other .PERIOD about  20  percent  of  all  the  nation  's  programmers  were  wrapped  up  in  this  thing ,COMMA and  it  led  to  an  awful  lot  of  what  we  have  today .PERIOD it  also  used  vacuum  tubes .PERIOD you  saw  how  huge  it  was ,COMMA and  to  give  you  a  sense  for  this ,COMMA because  we've  talked  a  lot  about  moore  's  law  and  making  things  small  at  this  conference ,COMMA so  let  's  talk  about  making  things  large .PERIOD if  we  took  whirlwind  and  put  it  in  a  place  that  you  all  know ,COMMA say ,COMMA century  city ,COMMA it  would  fit  beautifully .PERIOD you'd  kind  of  have  to  take  century  city  out ,COMMA but  it  could  fit  in  there .PERIOD but  like ,COMMA let  's  imagine  we  took  the  latest  pentium  processor ,COMMA the  latest  core  2  extreme ,COMMA which  is  a  four-core  processor  that  intel  's  working  on ,COMMA it  will  be  our  laptop  tomorrow .PERIOD to  build  that ,COMMA what  we'd  do  with  whirlwind  technology  is  we'd  have  to  take  up  roughly  from  the  10  to  mulholland ,COMMA and  from  the  405  to  la  cienega  just  with  those  whirlwinds .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA the  92  nuclear  power  plants  that  it  would  take  to  provide  the  power  would  fill  up  the  rest  of  los  angeles .PERIOD that  's  roughly  a  third  more  nuclear  power  than  all  of  france  creates .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  next  time  they  tell  you  they  're  on  to  something ,COMMA clearly  they  're  not .PERIOD so ,COMMA and  we  have  n't  even  worked  out  the  cooling  needs .PERIOD but  it  gives  you  the  kind  of  power  that  people  have ,COMMA that  the  audience  has ,COMMA and  the  reasons  these  transformations  are  happening .PERIOD all  of  this  stuff  starts  moving  into  industry .PERIOD dec  kind  of  reduces  all  this  and  makes  the  first  mini-computer .PERIOD it  shows  up  at  places  like  mit ,COMMA and  then  a  mutation  happens .PERIOD spacewar .PERIOD is  built ,COMMA the  first  computer  game ,COMMA and  all  of  a  sudden ,COMMA interactivity  and  involvement  and  passion  is  worked  out .PERIOD actually ,COMMA many  mit  students  stayed  up  all  night  long  working  on  this  thing ,COMMA and  many  of  the  principles  of  gaming  today  were  worked  out .PERIOD dec  knew  a  good  thing  about  wasting  time .PERIOD it  shipped  every  one  of  its  computers  with  that  game .PERIOD meanwhile ,COMMA as  all  of  this  is  happening ,COMMA by  the  mid-'50s ,COMMA the  business  model  of  traditional  broadcasting  and  cinema  has  been  busted  completely .PERIOD a  new  technology  has  confounded  radio  men  and  movie  moguls  and  they  're  quite  certain  that  television  is  about  to  do  them  in .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA despair  is  in  the  air .PERIOD and  a  quote  that  sounds  largely  reminiscent  from  everything  i've  been  reading  all  week .PERIOD rca  had  david  sarnoff ,COMMA who  basically  commercialized  radio ,COMMA said  this ,COMMA i  do  n't  say  that  radio  networks  must  die .PERIOD every  effort  has  been  made  and  will  continue  to  be  made  to  find  a  new  pattern ,COMMA new  selling  arrangements  and  new  types  of  programs  that  may  arrest  the  declining  revenues .PERIOD it  may  yet  be  possible  to  eke  out  a  poor  existence  for  radio ,COMMA but  i  do  n't  know  how .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA as  the  computer  industry  develops  interactively ,COMMA producers  in  the  emerging  tv  business  actually  hit  on  the  same  idea .PERIOD and  they  fake  it .PERIOD jack  berry ,COMMA boys  and  girls ,COMMA i  think  you  all  know  how  to  get  your  magic  windows  up  on  the  set ,COMMA you  just  get  them  out .PERIOD first  of  all ,COMMA get  your  winky  dink  kits  out .PERIOD put  out  your  magic  window  and  your  erasing  glove ,COMMA and  rub  it  like  this .PERIOD that  's  the  way  we  get  some  of  the  magic  into  it ,COMMA boys  and  girls .PERIOD then  take  it  and  put  it  right  up  against  the  screen  of  your  own  television  set ,COMMA and  rub  it  out  from  the  center  to  the  corners ,COMMA like  this .PERIOD make  sure  you  keep  your  magic  crayons  handy ,COMMA your  winky  dink  crayons  and  your  erasing  glove ,COMMA because  you  'll  be  using  them  during  the  show  to  draw  like  that .PERIOD you  all  set ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA let

should  ever  use  with  your  winky  dink  magic  window ,COMMA other  crayons  may  discolor  or  hurt  the  window .PERIOD this  proprietary  principle  of  vendor  lock-in  would  go  on  to  be  perfected  with  great  success  as  one  of  the  enduring  principles  of  windowing  systems  everywhere .PERIOD it  led  to  lawsuits ,COMMA federal  investigations ,COMMA and  lots  of  repercussions ,COMMA and  that  's  a  scandal  we  wo  n't  discuss  today .PERIOD but  we  will  discuss  this  scandal ,COMMA because  this  man ,COMMA jack  berry ,COMMA the  host  of  winky  dink ,COMMA went  on  to  become  the  host  of  twenty  one ,COMMA one  of  the  most  important  quiz  shows  ever .PERIOD and  it  was  rigged ,COMMA and  it  became  unraveled  when  this  man ,COMMA charles  van  doren ,COMMA was  outed  after  an  unnatural  winning  streak ,COMMA ending  berry  's  career .PERIOD and  actually ,COMMA ending  the  career  of  a  lot  of  people  at  cbs .PERIOD it  turns  out  there  was  a  lot  to  learn  about  how  this  new  medium  worked .PERIOD and  50  years  ago ,COMMA if  you'd  been  at  a  meeting  like  this  and  were  trying  to  understand  the  media ,COMMA there  was  one  prophet  and  only  but  one  you  wanted  to  hear  from ,COMMA professor  marshall  mcluhan .PERIOD he  actually  understood  something  about  a  theme  that  we've  been  discussing  all  week .PERIOD it  's  the  role  of  the  audience  in  an  era  of  pervasive  electronic  communications .PERIOD here  he  is  talking  from  the  1960s .PERIOD marshall  mcluhan ,COMMA if  the  audience  can  become  involved  in  the  actual  process  of  making  the  ad ,COMMA then  it  's  happy .PERIOD it  's  like  the  old  quiz  shows .PERIOD they  were  great  tv  because  it  gave  the  audience  a  role ,COMMA something  to  do .PERIOD they  were  horrified  when  they  discovered  they'd  really  been  left  out  all  the  time  because  the  shows  were  rigged .PERIOD now ,COMMA then ,COMMA this  was  a  horrible  misunderstanding  of  tv  on  the  part  of  the  programmers .PERIOD ph ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA mcluhan  talked  about  the  global  village .PERIOD if  you  substitute  the  word  blogosphere ,COMMA of  the  internet  today ,COMMA it  is  very  true  that  his  understanding  is  probably  very  enlightening  now .PERIOD let  's  listen  in  to  him .PERIOD mm ,COMMA the  global  village  is  a  world  in  which  you  do  n't  necessarily  have  harmony .PERIOD you  have  extreme  concern  with  everybody  else  's  business

.PERIOD ph ,COMMA we  'll  talk  a  little  bit  more  about  him  later .PERIOD we  're  now  right  into  the  1960s .PERIOD it  's  the  era  of  big  business  and  data  centers  for  computing .PERIOD but  all  that  was  about  to  change .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA the  expression  of  technology  reflects  the  people  and  the  time  of  the  culture  it  was  built  in .PERIOD and  when  i  say  that  code  expresses  our  hopes  and  aspirations ,COMMA it  's  not  just  a  joke  about  messianism ,COMMA it  's  actually  what  we  do .PERIOD but  for  this  part  of  the  story ,COMMA i'd  actually  like  to  throw  it  to  america  's  leading  technology  correspondent ,COMMA john  markoff .PERIOD john  markoff ,COMMA do  you  want  to  know  what  the  counterculture  in

,COMMA at  stanford  university ,COMMA between  1960  and  1975 .PERIOD in  the  midst  of  revolution  in  the  streets  and  rock  and  roll  concerts  in  the  parks ,COMMA a  group  of  researchers  led  by  people  like  john  mccarthy ,COMMA a  computer  scientist  at  the  stanford  artificial  intelligence  lab ,COMMA and  doug  engelbart ,COMMA a  computer  scientist  at  sri

on  the  mid-peninsula .PERIOD there  was  lsd  leaking  out  of  kesey  's  veterans  hospital  experiments  and  other  areas  around  the  campus ,COMMA and  there  was  music  literally  in  the

liberation .PERIOD there  was  women  's  liberation .PERIOD this  was  a  remarkable  place ,COMMA at  a  remarkable  time .PERIOD and  into  that  ferment  came  the  microprocessor .PERIOD i  think  it  was  that  interaction  that  led  to  personal  computing .PERIOD they  saw  these  tools  that  were  controlled  by  the  establishment  as  ones  that  could  actually  be  liberated  and

difficult  to  understand ,COMMA because  when  you  're  trapped  in  one  paradigm ,COMMA the  next  paradigm  is  always  like  a  science  fiction  universe ,COMMA it  makes  no  sense .PERIOD the  stories  were  so  compelling  that  i  decided  to  write  a  book  about  them .PERIOD the  title  of  the  book  is ,COMMA what  the  dormouse  said ,COMMA how  the  60s  counterculture  shaped

love  to  throw  it  back  to  marshall  mcluhan ,COMMA who ,COMMA 40  years  ago ,COMMA was  dealing  with  audiences  that  were  going  through  just  as  much  change ,COMMA and  i  think  that ,COMMA today ,COMMA traditional  hollywood  and  the  writers  are  framing  this  perhaps  in  the  way  that  it  was  being  framed  before .PERIOD but  i  do  n't  need  to  tell  you  this ,COMMA let  's  throw  it  back  to  him .PERIOD narrator ,COMMA we  are  in  the  middle  of  a  tremendous  clash  between  the  old  and  the  new .PERIOD mm ,COMMA the  medium  does  things  to  people  and  they  are  always  completely  unaware  of  this .PERIOD they  do  n't  really  notice  the  new  medium  that  is  wrapping  them  up .PERIOD they  think  of  the  old  medium ,COMMA because  the  old  medium  is  always  the  content  of  the  new  medium ,COMMA as  movies  tend  to  be  the  content  of  tv ,COMMA and  as  books  used  to  be  the  content ,COMMA novels  used  to  be  the  content  of  movies .PERIOD and  so  every  time  a  new  medium  arrives ,COMMA the  old  medium  is  the  content ,COMMA and  it  is  highly  observable ,COMMA highly  noticeable ,COMMA but  the  real ,COMMA real  roughing  up  and  massaging  is  done  by  the  new  medium ,COMMA and  it  is  ignored .PERIOD ph ,COMMA i  think  it  's  a  great  time  of  enthrallment .PERIOD there  's  been  more  raw  dna  of  communications  and  media  thrown  out  there .PERIOD content  is  moving  from  shows  to  particles  that  are  batted  back  and  forth ,COMMA and  part  of  social  communications ,COMMA and  i  think  this  is  going  to  be  a  time  of  great  renaissance  and  opportunity .PERIOD and  whereas  television  may  have  gotten  beat  up ,COMMA what  's  getting  built  is  a  really  exciting  new  form  of  communication ,COMMA and  we  kind  of  have  the  merger  of  the  two  industries  and  a  new  way  of  thinking  to  look  at  it .PERIOD thanks  very  much .PERIOD i  want  to  talk  about  penguins  today .PERIOD but  first ,COMMA i  want  to  start  by  saying  that  we  need  a  new  operating  system ,COMMA for  the  oceans  and  for  the  earth .PERIOD when  i  came  to  the  galapagos  40  years  ago ,COMMA there  were  3,000  people  that  lived  in  the  galapagos .PERIOD now  there  are  over  30,000 .PERIOD there  were  two  jeeps  on  santa  cruz .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  are  around  a  thousand  trucks  and  buses  and  cars  there .PERIOD so  the  fundamental  problems  that  we  face  are  overconsumption  and  too  many  people .PERIOD it  's  the  same  problems  in  the  galapagos ,COMMA except ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA it  's  worse  here ,COMMA in  some  ways ,COMMA than  other  places .PERIOD because  we've  only  doubled  the  population  of  the  earth  since  the  1960s ,COMMA a  little  more  than  doubled  -- .PERIOD but  we  have  67  billion  people  in  the  world .PERIOD and  we  all  like  to  consume .PERIOD and  one  of  the  major  problems  that  we  have  is  our  operating  system  is  not  giving  us  the  proper  feedback .PERIOD we  're  not  paying  the  true  environmental  costs  of  our  actions .PERIOD and  when  i  came  at  age  22  to  live  on  fernandina ,COMMA let  me  just  say ,COMMA that  i  had  never  camped  before .PERIOD i  had  never  lived  alone  for  any  period  of  time .PERIOD and  i'd  never  slept  with  sea  lions  snoring  next  to  me  all  night .PERIOD but  moreover ,COMMA i'd  never  lived  on  an  uninhabited  island .PERIOD punta  espinosa  is  where  i  lived  for  over  a  year .PERIOD and  we  call  it  uninhabited  because  there  are  no  people  there .PERIOD but  it  's  alive  with  life .PERIOD it  's  hardly  uninhabited .PERIOD so  a  lot  has  happened  in  the  last  40  years .PERIOD and  what  i  learned  when  i  came  to  the  galapagos  is  the  importance  of  wild  places ,COMMA wild  things ,COMMA certainly  wildlife ,COMMA and  the  amazing  qualities  that  penguins  have .PERIOD penguins  are  real  athletes: .PERIOD they  can  swim  173  kilometers  in  a  day .PERIOD they  can  swim  at  the  same  speed  day  and  night  -- .PERIOD that  's  faster  than  any  olympic  swimmer .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA they  can  do  like  seven  kilometers  an  hour  and  sustain  it .PERIOD but  what  is  really  amazing ,COMMA because  of  this  deepness  here ,COMMA emperor  penguins  can  go  down  more  than  500  meters .PERIOD and  they  can  hold  their  breath  for  23  minutes .PERIOD magellanic  penguins ,COMMA the  ones  that  i  work  on ,COMMA they  can  dive  to  about  90  meters  and  they  can  stay  down  for  about  46  minutes .PERIOD humans ,COMMA without  fins ,COMMA 90  meters ,COMMA 35  minutes .PERIOD and  i  doubt  anybody  in  this  room  could  really  hold  their  breath  for  35  minutes .PERIOD you  have  to  train  to  be  able  to  do  that .PERIOD so  penguins  are  amazing  athletes .PERIOD the  other  thing  is ,COMMA i've  never  met  anybody  that  really  does  n't  say  that  they  like  penguins .PERIOD they  're  comical ,COMMA they  walk  upright ,COMMA and ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA they  're  diligent .PERIOD and ,COMMA more  importantly ,COMMA they  're  well-dressed .PERIOD so  they  have  all  the  criteria  that  people  normally  like .PERIOD but  scientifically ,COMMA they  're  amazing  because  they  're  sentinels .PERIOD they  tell  us  about  our  world  in  a  lot  of  different  ways ,COMMA and  particularly  the  ocean .PERIOD this  is  a  picture  of  a  galapagos  penguin  that  's  on  the  front  of  a  little  zodiac  here  in  the  galapagos .PERIOD and  that  's  what  i  came  to  study .PERIOD i  thought  i  was  going  to  study  the  social  behavior  of  galapagos  penguins ,COMMA but  you  already  know  penguins  are  rare .PERIOD these  are  the  rarest  penguins  in  the  world .PERIOD why  i  thought  i  was  going  to  be  able  to  do  that ,COMMA i  do  n't  know .PERIOD but  the  population  has  changed  dramatically  since  i  was  first  here .PERIOD when  i  counted  penguins  for  the  first  time  and  tried  to  do  a  census ,COMMA we  just  counted  all  the  individual  beaks  that  we  could  around  all  these  islands .PERIOD we  counted  around  2,000 ,COMMA so  i  do  n't  know  how  many  penguins  there  really  are ,COMMA but  i  know  i  can  count  2,000 .PERIOD if  you  go  and  do  it  now ,COMMA the  national  parks  count  about  500 .PERIOD so  we  have  a  quarter  of  the  penguins  that  we  did  40  years  ago .PERIOD and  this  is  true  of  most  of  our  living  systems .PERIOD we  have  less  than  we  had  before ,COMMA and  most  of  them  are  in  fairly  steep  decline .PERIOD and  i  want  to  just  show  you  a  little  bit  about  why .PERIOD that  's  a  penguin  braying  to  tell  you  that  it  's  important  to  pay  attention  to  penguins .PERIOD most  important  of  all ,COMMA i  did  n't  know  what  that  was  the  first  time  i  heard  it .PERIOD and  you  can  imagine  sleeping  on  fernandina  your  first  night  there  and  you  hear  this  lonesome ,COMMA plaintful  call .PERIOD i  fell  in  love  with  penguins ,COMMA and  it  certainly  has  changed  the  rest  of  my  life .PERIOD what  i  found  out  i  was  studying  is  really  the  difference  in  how  the  galapagos  changes ,COMMA the  most  extreme  variation .PERIOD you've  heard  about  these  el  ninos ,COMMA but  this  is  the  extreme  that  penguins  all  over  the  world  have  to  adapt  to .PERIOD this  is  a  cold-water  event  called  la  nina .PERIOD where  it  's  blue  and  it  's  green ,COMMA it  means  the  water  is  really  cold .PERIOD and  so  you  can  see  this  current  coming  up ,COMMA in  this  case ,COMMA the  humboldt  current ,COMMA that  comes  all  the  way  out  to  the  galapagos  islands .PERIOD and  this  deep  undersea  current ,COMMA the  cromwell  current ,COMMA that  upwells  around  the  galapagos .PERIOD that  brings  all  the  nutrients: .PERIOD when  this  is  cold  in  the  galapagos ,COMMA it  's  rich ,COMMA and  there  's  plenty  of  food  for  everyone .PERIOD when  we  have  extreme  el  nino  events ,COMMA you  see  all  this  red ,COMMA and  you  see  no  green  out  here  around  the  galapagos .PERIOD that  means  that  there  's  no  upwelling ,COMMA and  there  's  basically  no  food .PERIOD so  it  's  a  real  desert  for  not  only  for  the  penguins  and  the  sea  lions  and  the  marine  iguanas .PERIOD things  die  when  there  's  no  food .PERIOD but  we  did  n't  even  know  that  that  affected  the  galapagos  when  i  went  to  study  penguins .PERIOD and  you  can  imagine  being  on  an  island  hoping  you  're  going  to  see  penguins ,COMMA and  you  're  in  the  middle  of  an  el  nino  event  and  there  are  no  penguins .PERIOD they  're  not  breeding .PERIOD they  're  not  even  around .PERIOD i  studied  marine  iguanas  at  that  point .PERIOD but  this  is  a  global  phenomenon ,COMMA we  know  that .PERIOD and  if  you  look  along  the  coast  of  argentina ,COMMA where  i  work  now ,COMMA at  a  place  called  punta  tombo ,COMMA the  largest  magellanic  penguin  colony  in  the  world  down  here  about  44  degrees  south  latitude ,COMMA you  see  that  there  's  great  variation  here .PERIOD some  years ,COMMA the  cold  water  goes  all  the  way  up  to  brazil ,COMMA and  other  years ,COMMA in  these  la  nina  years ,COMMA it  does  n't .PERIOD so  the  oceans  do  n't  always  act  together .PERIOD they  act  differently ,COMMA but  that  is  the  kind  of  variation  that  penguins  have  to  live  with ,COMMA and  it  's  not  easy .PERIOD so  when  i  went  to  study  the  magellanic  penguins ,COMMA i  did  n't  have  any  problems .PERIOD there  were  plenty  of  them .PERIOD this  is  a  picture  at  punta  tombo  in  february  showing  all  the  penguins  along  the  beach .PERIOD i  went  there  because  the  japanese  wanted  to  start  harvesting  them  and  turning  them  into  high  fashion  golf  gloves ,COMMA protein  and  oil .PERIOD fortunately ,COMMA nobody  has  harvested  any  penguins  and  we  're  getting  over  100,000  tourists  a  year  to  see  them .PERIOD but  the  population  is  declining .PERIOD and  it  's  declined  fairly  substantially ,COMMA about  21  percent  since  1987 ,COMMA when  i  started  these  surveys ,COMMA in  terms  of  number  of  active  nests .PERIOD here ,COMMA you  can  see  where  punta  tombo  is .PERIOD and  they  breed  in  incredibly  dense  colonies .PERIOD we  know  this  because  of  long-term  science ,COMMA because  we  have  long-term  studies  there .PERIOD and  science  is  important  in  informing  decision  makers ,COMMA and  also  in  changing  how  we  do  and  knowing  the  direction  of  change  that  we  're  going  in .PERIOD and  so  we  have  this  penguin  project .PERIOD the  wildlife  conservation  society  has  funded  me  along  with  a  lot  of  individuals  over  the  last  27  years  to  be  able  to  produce  these  kinds  of  maps .PERIOD and  also ,COMMA we  know  that  it  's  not  only  galapagos  penguins  that  are  in  trouble ,COMMA but  magellanics  and  many  other  species  of  penguins .PERIOD and  so  we  have  started  a  global  penguin  society  to  try  to  focus  on  the  real  plight  of  penguins .PERIOD this  is  one  of  the  plights  of  penguins ,COMMA oil  pollution .PERIOD penguins  do  n't  like  oil  and  they  do  n't  like  to  swim  through  oil .PERIOD the  nice  thing  is ,COMMA if  you  look  down  here  in  argentina ,COMMA there  's  no  surface  oil  pollution  from  this  composite  map .PERIOD but ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA when  we  went  to  argentina ,COMMA penguins  were  often  found  totally  covered  in  oil .PERIOD so  they  were  just  minding  their  own  business .PERIOD they  ended  up  swimming  through  ballast  water  that  had  oil  in  it .PERIOD because  when  tankers  carry  oil  they  have  to  have  ballast  at  some  point ,COMMA so  when  they  're  empty ,COMMA they  have  the  ballast  water  in  there .PERIOD when  they  come  back ,COMMA they  actually  dump  this  oily  ballast  water  into  the  ocean .PERIOD why  do  they  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK because  it  's  cheaper ,COMMA because  they  do  n't  pay  the  real  environmental  costs .PERIOD we  usually  do  n't ,COMMA and  we  want  to  start  getting  the  accounting  system  right  so  we  can  pay  the  real  cost .PERIOD at  first ,COMMA the  argentine  government  said ,COMMA no ,COMMA there  's  no  way .PERIOD you  cannot  find  oiled  penguins  in  argentina .PERIOD we  have  laws .PERIOD and  we  cannot  have  illegal  dumping .PERIOD it  's  against  the  law .PERIOD so  we  ended  up  spending  nine  years  convincing  the  government  that  there  were  lots  of  oiled  penguins .PERIOD in  some  years ,COMMA like  this  year ,COMMA we  found  more  than  80  percent  of  the  adult  penguins  dead  on  the  beach  were  covered  in  oil .PERIOD these  little  blue  dots  are  the  fledglings ,COMMA we  do  this  survey  every  march ,COMMA which  means  that  they  're  only  in  the  environment  from  january  until  march ,COMMA so  maybe  three  months  at  the  most  that  they  could  get  covered  in  oil .PERIOD and  you  can  see ,COMMA in  some  years  over  60  percent  of  the  fledglings  were  oiled .PERIOD eventually ,COMMA the  government  listened  and ,COMMA amazingly ,COMMA they  changed  their  laws .PERIOD they  moved  the  tanker  lanes  40  kilometers  farther  off  shore ,COMMA and  people  are  not  doing  as  much  illegal  dumping .PERIOD so  what  we  're  seeing  now  is  very  few  penguins  are  oiled .PERIOD why  are  there  even  these  penguins  oiled ?QUESTIONMARK because  we've  solved  the  problem  in  chubut  province ,COMMA which  is  like  a  state  in  argentina  where  punta  tombo  is ,COMMA so  that  's  about  1,000  kilometers  of  coastline ,COMMA but  we  have  n't  solved  the  problem  in  northern  argentina ,COMMA uruguay  and  brazil .PERIOD so  now  i  want  to  show  you  that  penguins  are  affected .PERIOD i  'm  just  going  to  talk  about  two  things .PERIOD this  is  climate  change .PERIOD now  this  has  really  been  a  fun  study  because  i  put  satellite  tags  on  the  back  of  these  magellanic  penguins .PERIOD try  to  convince  donors  to  give  you  a  couple  thousand  dollars  to  glue  a  satellite  tag  on  the  back  of  penguins .PERIOD but  we've  been  doing  this  now  for  more  than  a  decade  to  learn  where  they  go .PERIOD we  thought  we  needed  a  marine  protected  area  of  about  30  kilometers ,COMMA and  then  we  put  a  satellite  tag  on  the  back  of  a  penguin .PERIOD and  what  the  penguins  show  us ,COMMA and  these  are  all  the  little  dots  from  where  the  penguins  positions  were  for  penguins  in  incubation  in  2003  -- .PERIOD and  what  you  see  is  some  of  these  individuals  are  going  800  kilometers  away  from  their  nests .PERIOD so  that  means  as  their  mate  is  sitting  on  the  nest  incubating  the  eggs ,COMMA the  other  one  is  out  there  foraging .PERIOD and  the  longer  they  have  to  stay  gone ,COMMA the  worse  condition  the  mate  is  in  when  the  mate  comes  back .PERIOD and ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA all  of  this  then  leads  to  a  vicious  cycle  and  you  cannot  raise  a  lot  of  chicks .PERIOD here  you  see  in  2003 ,COMMA these  are  all  the  dots  of  where  the  penguins  are ,COMMA they  were  raising  a  little  over  a  half  of  a  chick .PERIOD here ,COMMA you  can  see  in  2006 ,COMMA they  raised  almost  three  quarters  of  a  chick  per  nest .PERIOD and  you  can  see  that  they  're  closer  to  punta  tombo .PERIOD they  're  not  going  as  far  away .PERIOD this  past  year ,COMMA in  2009 ,COMMA you  can  see  that  they  're  now  raising  about  a  fourth  of  a  chick .PERIOD and  some  of  these  individuals  are  going  more  than  900  kilometers  away  from  their  nests .PERIOD so  it  's  kind  of  like  you  having  a  job  in  chicago ,COMMA and  then  you  get  transferred  to  st .PERIOD louis ,COMMA and  your  mate  is  not  happy  about  this  because  you've  got  to  pay  airfare ,COMMA because  you  're  gone  longer .PERIOD the  same  thing  's  true  for  penguins  as  well .PERIOD and  they  're  going  about ,COMMA on  average  now ,COMMA 40  kilometers  farther  than  they  did  a  decade  ago .PERIOD we  need  to  be  able  to  get  information  out  to  the  general  public .PERIOD and  so  we  started  a  publication  with  the  society  for  conservation  that  we  think  presents  cutting-edge  science  in  a  new ,COMMA novel  way ,COMMA because  we  have  reporters  that  are  good  writers  that  actually  can  distill  the  information  and  make  it  accessible  to  the  general  public .PERIOD so  if  you  're  interested  in  cutting-edge  science  and  smarter  conservation ,COMMA you  should  join  with  our  11  partners ,COMMA some  of  them  here  in  this  room ,COMMA like  the  nature  conservancy ,COMMA and  look  at  this  magazine  because  we  need  to  get  information  out  about  conservation  to  the  general  public .PERIOD lastly  i  want  to  say  that  all  of  you ,COMMA probably ,COMMA have  had  some  relationship  at  some  time  in  your  life  with  a  dog ,COMMA a  cat ,COMMA some  sort  of  pet ,COMMA and  you  recognized  that  those  are  individuals .PERIOD and  some  of  you  consider  them  almost  part  of  your  family .PERIOD if  you  had  a  relationship  with  a  penguin ,COMMA you'd  see  it  in  the  same  sort  of  way .PERIOD they  're  amazing  creatures  that  really  change  how  you  view  the  world  because  they  're  not  that  different  from  us: .PERIOD they  're  trying  to  make  a  living .PERIOD they  're  trying  to  raise  their  offspring .PERIOD they  're  trying  to  get  on  and  survive  in  the  world .PERIOD this  is  turbo  the  penguin .PERIOD turbo  's  never  been  fed .PERIOD he  met  us  and  got  his  name  because  he  started  standing  under  my  diesel  truck ,COMMA a  turbo  truck ,COMMA so  we  named  him  turbo .PERIOD turbo  has  taken  to  knocking  on  the  door  with  his  beak .PERIOD we  let  him  in  and  he  comes  in  here .PERIOD and  i  just  wanted  to  show  you  what  happened  one  day  when  turbo  brought  in  a  friend .PERIOD so  this  is  turbo .PERIOD he  's  coming  up  to  one  of  my  graduate  students  and  flipper  patting ,COMMA which  he  would  do  to  a  female  penguin .PERIOD and  you  can  see ,COMMA he  's  not  trying  to  bite .PERIOD this  guy  has  never  been  in  before  and  he  's  trying  to  figure  out ,COMMA what  is  going  on ?QUESTIONMARK what  is  this  guy  doing ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  really  pretty  weird .PERIOD and  you  'll  see  soon  that  my  graduate  student .PERIOD and  you  see ,COMMA turbo  's  pretty  intent  on  his  flipper  patting .PERIOD and  now  he  's  looking  at  the  other  guy ,COMMA saying ,COMMA you  are  really  weird .PERIOD and  now  look  at  this ,COMMA not  friendly .PERIOD so  penguins  really  differ  in  their  personalities  just  like  our  dogs  and  our  cats .PERIOD we  're  also  trying  to  collect  our  information  and  become  more  technologically  literate .PERIOD so  we  're  trying  to  put  that  in  computers  in  the  field .PERIOD and  penguins  are  always  involved  in  helping  us  or  not  helping  us  in  one  way  or  another .PERIOD this  is  a  radio  frequency  id  system .PERIOD you  put  a  little  piece  of  rice  in  the  foot  of  a  penguin  that  has  a  barcode ,COMMA so  it  tells  you  who  it  is .PERIOD it  walks  over  the  pad ,COMMA and  you  know  who  it  is .PERIOD okay ,COMMA so  here  are  a  few  penguins  coming  in .PERIOD see ,COMMA this  one  's  coming  back  to  its  nest .PERIOD they  're  all  coming  in  at  this  time ,COMMA walking  across  there ,COMMA just  kind  of  leisurely  coming  in .PERIOD here  's  a  female  that  's  in  a  hurry .PERIOD she  's  got  food .PERIOD she  's  really  rushing  back ,COMMA because  it  's  hot ,COMMA to  try  to  feed  her  chicks .PERIOD and  then  there  's  another  fellow  that  will  leisurely  come  by .PERIOD look  how  fat  he  is .PERIOD he  's  walking  back  to  feed  his  chicks .PERIOD then  i  realize  that  they  're  playing  king  of  the  box .PERIOD this  is  my  box  up  here ,COMMA and  this  is  the  system  that  works .PERIOD you  can  see  this  penguin ,COMMA he  goes  over ,COMMA he  looks  at  those  wires ,COMMA does  not  like  that  wire .PERIOD he  unplugs  the  wire .PERIOD we  have  no  data .PERIOD so ,COMMA they  really  are  pretty  amazing  creatures .PERIOD ok .PERIOD most  important  thing  is ,COMMA only  you  can  change  yourself .PERIOD and  only  you  can  change  the  world  and  make  it  better ,COMMA for  people  as  well  as  penguins .PERIOD let  me  share  with  you  today  an  original  discovery .PERIOD but  i  want  to  tell  it  to  you  the  way  it  really  happened  -- .PERIOD not  the  way  i  present  it  in  a  scientific  meeting ,COMMA or  the  way  you'd  read  it  in  a  scientific  paper .PERIOD it  's  a  story  about  beyond  biomimetics ,COMMA to  something  i  'm  calling  biomutualism .PERIOD i  define  that  as  an  association  between  biology  and  another  discipline .PERIOD where  each  discipline  reciprocally  advances  the  other ,COMMA but  where  the  collective  discoveries  that  emerge  are  beyond  any  single  field .PERIOD now ,COMMA in  terms  of  biomimetics ,COMMA as  human  technologies  take  on  more  of  the  characteristics  of  nature ,COMMA nature  becomes  a  much  more  useful  teacher .PERIOD engineering  can  be  inspired  by  biology  by  using  its  principles  and  analogies  when  they  're  advantageous .PERIOD but  then  integrating  that  with  the  best  human  engineering ,COMMA ultimately  to  make  something  actually  better  than  nature .PERIOD now ,COMMA being  a  biologist ,COMMA i  was  very  curious  about  this .PERIOD these  are  gecko  toes .PERIOD and  we  wondered  how  they  use  these  bizarre  toes  to  climb  up  a  wall  so  quickly .PERIOD we  discovered  it .PERIOD and  what  we  found  was  that  they  have  leaf-like  structures  on  their  toes ,COMMA with  millions  of  tiny  hairs  that  look  like  a  rug .PERIOD and  each  of  those  hairs  has  the  worst  case  of  split-ends  possible ,COMMA about  100  to  1000  split  ends  that  are  nano-size .PERIOD and  the  individual  has  2  billion  of  these  nano-size  split  ends .PERIOD they  do  n't  stick  by  velcro  or  suction  or  glue .PERIOD they  actually  stick  by  intermolecular  forces  alone ,COMMA van  der  waals  forces .PERIOD and  i  'm  really  pleased  to  report  to  you  today  that  the  first  synthetic  self-cleaning ,COMMA dry  adhesive  has  been  made .PERIOD from  the  simplest  version  in  nature ,COMMA one  branch .PERIOD my  engineering  collaborator ,COMMA ron  fearing ,COMMA at  berkeley ,COMMA had  made  the  first  synthetic  version .PERIOD and  so  has  my  other  incredible  collaborator ,COMMA mark  cutkosky ,COMMA at  stanford  -- .PERIOD he  made  much  larger  hairs  than  the  gecko ,COMMA but  used  the  same  general  principles .PERIOD and  here  is  its  first  test .PERIOD that  's  kellar  autumn ,COMMA my  former  phd .PERIOD student ,COMMA professor  now  at  lewis  and  clark ,COMMA literally  giving  his  first-born  child  up  for  this  test .PERIOD more  recently ,COMMA this  happened .PERIOD man ,COMMA this  the  first  time  someone  has  actually  climbed  with  it .PERIOD narrator ,COMMA lynn  verinsky ,COMMA a  professional  climber ,COMMA who  appeared  to  be  brimming  with  confidence .PERIOD lynn  verinsky ,COMMA honestly ,COMMA it  's  going  to  be  perfectly  safe .PERIOD it  will  be  perfectly  safe .PERIOD man ,COMMA how  do  you  know ?QUESTIONMARK lynn  verinsky ,COMMA because  of  liability  insurance .PERIOD narrator ,COMMA with  a  mattress  below  and  attached  to  a  safety  rope ,COMMA lynn  began  her  60-foot  ascent .PERIOD lynn  made  it  to  the  top  in  a  perfect  pairing  of  hollywood  and  science .PERIOD man ,COMMA so  you  're  the  first  human  being  to  officially  emulate  a  gecko .PERIOD lynn  verinsky ,COMMA ha .PERIOD wow .PERIOD and  what  a  privilege  that  has  been .PERIOD robert  full ,COMMA that  's  what  she  did  on  rough  surfaces .PERIOD but  she  actually  used  these  on  smooth  surfaces ,COMMA two  of  them ,COMMA to  climb  up ,COMMA and  pull  herself  up .PERIOD and  you  can  try  this  in  the  lobby ,COMMA and  look  at  the  gecko-inspired  material .PERIOD now  the  problem  with  the  robots  doing  this  is  that  they  cannot  get  unstuck ,COMMA with  the  material .PERIOD this  is  the  gecko  's  solution .PERIOD they  actually  peel  their  toes  away  from  the  surface ,COMMA at  high  rates ,COMMA as  they  run  up  the  wall .PERIOD well  i  'm  really  excited  today  to  show  you  the  newest  version  of  a  robot ,COMMA stickybot ,COMMA using  a  new  hierarchical  dry  adhesive .PERIOD here  is  the  actual  robot .PERIOD and  here  is  what  it  does .PERIOD and  if  you  look ,COMMA you  can  see  that  it  uses  the  toe  peeling ,COMMA just  like  the  gecko  does .PERIOD if  we  can  show  some  of  the  video ,COMMA you  can  see  it  climbing  up  the  wall .PERIOD there  it  is .PERIOD and  now  it  can  go  on  other  surfaces  because  of  the  new  adhesive  that  the  stanford  group  was  able  to  do  in  designing  this  incredible  robot .PERIOD oh .PERIOD one  thing  i  want  to  point  out  is ,COMMA look  at  stickybot .PERIOD you  see  something  on  it .PERIOD it  's  not  just  to  look  like  a  gecko .PERIOD it  has  a  tail .PERIOD and  just  when  you  think  you've  figured  out  nature ,COMMA this  kind  of  thing  happens .PERIOD the  engineers  told  us ,COMMA for  the  climbing  robots ,COMMA that ,COMMA if  they  do  n't  have  a  tail ,COMMA they  fall  off  the  wall .PERIOD so  what  they  did  was  they  asked  us  an  important  question .PERIOD they  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it  kind  of  looks  like  a  tail .PERIOD even  though  we  put  a  passive  bar  there .PERIOD do  animals  use  their  tails  when  they  climb  up  walls ?QUESTIONMARK what  they  were  doing  was  returning  the  favor ,COMMA by  giving  us  a  hypothesis  to  test ,COMMA in  biology ,COMMA that  we  would  n't  have  thought  of .PERIOD so  of  course ,COMMA in  reality ,COMMA we  were  then  panicked ,COMMA being  the  biologists ,COMMA and  we  should  know  this  already .PERIOD we  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what  do  tails  do ?QUESTIONMARK well  we  know  that  tails  store  fat ,COMMA for  example .PERIOD we  know  that  you  can  grab  onto  things  with  them .PERIOD and  perhaps  it  is  most  well  known  that  they  provide  static  balance .PERIOD it  can  also  act  as  a  counterbalance .PERIOD so  watch  this  kangaroo .PERIOD see  that  tail ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  incredible .PERIOD marc  raibert  built  a  uniroo  hopping  robot .PERIOD and  it  was  unstable  without  its  tail .PERIOD now  mostly  tails  limit  maneuverability .PERIOD like  this  human  inside  this  dinosaur  suit .PERIOD my  colleagues  actually  went  on  to  test  this  limitation ,COMMA by  increasing  the  moment  of  inertia  of  a  student ,COMMA so  they  had  a  tail ,COMMA and  running  them  through  and  obstacle  course ,COMMA and  found  a  decrement  in  performance .PERIOD like  you'd  predict .PERIOD but  of  course ,COMMA this  is  a  passive  tail .PERIOD and  you  can  also  have  active  tails .PERIOD and  when  i  went  back  to  research  this ,COMMA i  realized  that  one  of  the  great  ted  moments  in  the  past ,COMMA from  nathan ,COMMA we've  talked  about  an  active  tail .PERIOD video ,COMMA myhrvold  thinks  tail-cracking  dinosaurs  were  interested  in  love ,COMMA not  war .PERIOD robert  full ,COMMA he  talked  about  the  tail  being  a  whip  for  communication .PERIOD it  can  also  be  used  in  defense .PERIOD pretty  powerful .PERIOD so  we  then  went  back  and  looked  at  the  animal .PERIOD and  we  ran  it  up  a  surface .PERIOD but  this  time  what  we  did  is  we  put  a  slippery  patch  that  you  see  in  yellow  there .PERIOD and  watch  on  the  right  what  the  animal  is  doing  with  its  tail  when  it  slips .PERIOD this  is  slowed  down  10  times .PERIOD so  here  is  normal  speed .PERIOD and  watch  it  now  slip ,COMMA and  see  what  it  does  with  its  tail .PERIOD it  has  an  active  tail  that  functions  as  a  fifth  leg .PERIOD and  it  contributes  to  stability .PERIOD if  you  make  it  slip  a  huge  amount ,COMMA this  is  what  we  discovered .PERIOD this  is  incredible .PERIOD the  engineers  had  a  really  good  idea .PERIOD and  then  of  course  we  wondered ,COMMA okay ,COMMA they  have  an  active  tail ,COMMA but  let  's  picture  them .PERIOD they  're  climbing  up  a  wall ,COMMA or  a  tree .PERIOD and  they  get  to  the  top  and  let  's  say  there  's  some  leaves  there .PERIOD and  what  would  happen  if  they  climbed  on  the  underside  of  that  leaf ,COMMA and  there  was  some  wind ,COMMA or  we  shook  it ?QUESTIONMARK and  we  did  that  experiment ,COMMA that  you  see  here .PERIOD and  this  is  what  we  discovered .PERIOD now  that  's  real  time .PERIOD you  cannot  see  anything .PERIOD but  there  it  is  slowed  down .PERIOD what  we  discovered  was  the  world  's  fastest  air-righting  response .PERIOD for  those  of  you  who  remember  your  physics ,COMMA that  's  a  zero-angular-momentum  righting  response .PERIOD but  it  's  like  a  cat .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA cats  falling .PERIOD cats  do  this .PERIOD they  twist  their  bodies .PERIOD but  geckos  do  it  better .PERIOD and  they  do  it  with  their  tail .PERIOD so  they  do  it  with  this  active  tail  as  they  swing  around .PERIOD and  then  they  always  land  in  the  sort  of  superman  skydiving  posture .PERIOD okay ,COMMA now  we  wondered ,COMMA if  we  were  right ,COMMA we  should  be  able  to  test  this  in  a  physical  model ,COMMA in  a  robot .PERIOD so  for  ted  we  actually  built  a  robot ,COMMA over  there ,COMMA a  prototype ,COMMA with  the  tail .PERIOD and  we  're  going  to  attempt  the  first  air-righting  response  in  a  tail ,COMMA with  a  robot .PERIOD if  we  could  have  the  lights  on  it .PERIOD okay ,COMMA there  it  goes .PERIOD and  show  the  video .PERIOD there  it  is .PERIOD and  it  works  just  like  it  does  in  the  animal .PERIOD so  all  you  need  is  a  swing  of  the  tail  to  right  yourself .PERIOD now ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA we  were  normally  frightened  because  the  animal  has  no  gliding  adaptations ,COMMA so  we  thought ,COMMA oh  that  's  okay .PERIOD we  'll  put  it  in  a  vertical  wind  tunnel .PERIOD we  'll  blow  the  air  up ,COMMA we  'll  give  it  a  landing  target ,COMMA a  tree  trunk ,COMMA just  outside  the  plexi-glass  enclosure ,COMMA and  see  what  it  does .PERIOD so  we  did .PERIOD and  here  is  what  it  does .PERIOD so  the  wind  is  coming  from  the  bottom .PERIOD this  is  slowed  down  10  times .PERIOD it  does  an  equilibrium  glide .PERIOD highly  controlled .PERIOD this  is  sort  of  incredible .PERIOD but  actually  it  's  quite  beautiful ,COMMA when  you  take  a  picture  of  it .PERIOD and  it  's  better  than  that ,COMMA it ,COMMA just  in  the  slide ,COMMA maneuvers  in  mid-air .PERIOD and  the  way  it  does  it ,COMMA is  it  takes  its  tail  and  it  swings  it  one  way  to  yaw  left ,COMMA and  it  swings  its  other  way  to  yaw  right .PERIOD so  we  can  maneuver  this  way .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA we  had  to  film  this  several  times  to  believe  this ,COMMA it  also  does  this .PERIOD watch  this .PERIOD it  oscillates  its  tail  up  and  down  like  a  dolphin .PERIOD it  can  actually  swim  through  the  air .PERIOD but  watch  its  front  legs .PERIOD can  you  see  what  they  are  doing ?QUESTIONMARK what  does  that  mean  for  the  origin  of  flapping  flight ?QUESTIONMARK maybe  it  's  evolved  from  coming  down  from  trees ,COMMA and  trying  to  control  a  glide .PERIOD stay  tuned  for  that .PERIOD so  then  we  wondered ,COMMA can  they  actually  maneuver  with  this ?QUESTIONMARK so  there  is  the  landing  target .PERIOD could  they  steer  towards  it  with  these  capabilities ?QUESTIONMARK here  it  is  in  the  wind  tunnel .PERIOD and  it  certainly  looks  like  it .PERIOD you  can  see  it  even  better  from  down  on  top .PERIOD watch  the  animal .PERIOD definitely  moving  towards  the  landing  target .PERIOD watch  the  whip  of  its  tail  as  it  does  it .PERIOD look  at  that .PERIOD it  's  unbelievable .PERIOD so  now  we  were  really  confused .PERIOD because  there  are  no  reports  of  it  gliding .PERIOD so  we  went ,COMMA oh  my  god ,COMMA we  have  to  go  to  the  field ,COMMA and  see  if  it  actually  does  this .PERIOD completely  opposite  of  the  way  you'd  see  it  on  a  nature  film ,COMMA of  course .PERIOD we  wondered ,COMMA do  they  actually  glide  in  nature ?QUESTIONMARK well  we  went  to  the  forests  of  singapore  and  southeast  asia .PERIOD and  the  next  video  you  see  is  the  first  time  we've  showed  this .PERIOD this  is  the  actual  video ,COMMA not  staged ,COMMA a  real  research  video ,COMMA of  animal  gliding  down .PERIOD there  is  a  red  trajectory  line .PERIOD look  at  the  end  to  see  the  animal .PERIOD but  then  as  it  gets  closer  to  the  tree ,COMMA look  at  the  close-up .PERIOD and  see  if  you  can  see  it  land .PERIOD so  there  it  comes  down .PERIOD there  is  a  gecko  at  the  end  of  that  trajectory  line .PERIOD you  see  it  there ?QUESTIONMARK there ?QUESTIONMARK watch  it  come  down .PERIOD now  watch  up  there  and  you  can  see  the  landing .PERIOD did  you  see  it  hit ?QUESTIONMARK it  actually  uses  its  tail  too .PERIOD just  like  we  saw  in  the  lab .PERIOD so  now  we  can  continue  this  mutualism  by  suggesting  that  they  can  make  an  active  tail .PERIOD and  here  is  the  first  active  tail ,COMMA in  the  robot ,COMMA made  by  boston  dynamics .PERIOD so  to  conclude ,COMMA i  think  we  need  to  build  biomutualisms ,COMMA like  i  showed ,COMMA that  will  increase  the  pace  of  basic  discovery  in  their  application .PERIOD to  do  this  though ,COMMA we  need  to  redesign  education  in  a  major  way ,COMMA to  balance  depth  with  interdisciplinary  communication .PERIOD and  explicitly  train  people  how  to  contribute  to ,COMMA and  benefit  from  other  disciplines .PERIOD and  of  course  you  need  the  organisms  and  the  environment  to  do  it .PERIOD that  is ,COMMA whether  you  care  about  security ,COMMA search  and  rescue  or  health ,COMMA we  must  preserve  nature  's  designs ,COMMA otherwise  these  secrets  will  be  lost  forever .PERIOD and  from  what  i  heard  from  our  new  president ,COMMA i  'm  very  optimistic .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD amongst  all  the  troubling  deficits  we  struggle  with  today ,COMMA we  think  of  financial  and  economic  primarily ,COMMA the  ones  that  concern  me  most  is  the  deficit  of  political  dialogue ,COMMA our  ability  to  address  modern  conflicts  as  they  are ,COMMA to  go  to  the  source  of  what  they  're  all  about  and  to  understand  the  key  players  and  to  deal  with  them .PERIOD we  who  are  diplomats ,COMMA we  are  trained  to  deal  with  conflicts  between  states  and  issues  between  states .PERIOD and  i  can  tell  you ,COMMA our  agenda  is  full .PERIOD there  is  trade ,COMMA there  is  disarmament ,COMMA there  is  cross-border  relations .PERIOD but  the  picture  is  changing ,COMMA and  we  are  seeing  that  there  are  new  key  players  coming  onto  the  scene .PERIOD we  loosely  call  them  groups .PERIOD they  may  represent  social ,COMMA religious ,COMMA political ,COMMA economic ,COMMA military  realities .PERIOD and  we  struggle  with  how  to  deal  with  them .PERIOD the  rules  of  engagement ,COMMA how  to  talk ,COMMA when  to  talk ,COMMA and  how  to  deal  with  them .PERIOD let  me  show  you  a  slide  here  which  illustrates  the  character  of  conflicts  since  1946  until  today .PERIOD you  see  the  green  is  a  traditional  interstate  conflict ,COMMA the  ones  we  used  to  read  about .PERIOD the  red  is  modern  conflict ,COMMA conflicts  within  states .PERIOD these  are  quite  different ,COMMA and  they  are  outside  the  grasp  of  modern  diplomacy .PERIOD and  the  core  of  these  key  actors  are  groups  who  represent  different  interests  inside  countries .PERIOD and  the  way  they  deal  with  their  conflicts  rapidly  spreads  to  other  countries .PERIOD so  in  a  way ,COMMA it  is  everybody  's  business .PERIOD another  acknowledgment  we've  seen  during  these  years ,COMMA recent  years ,COMMA is  that  very  few  of  these  domestic  interstate ,COMMA intrastate  conflicts  can  be  solved  militarily .PERIOD they  may  have  to  be  dealt  with  with  military  means ,COMMA but  they  cannot  be  solved  by  military  means .PERIOD they  need  political  solutions .PERIOD and  we ,COMMA therefore ,COMMA have  a  problem ,COMMA because  they  escape  traditional  diplomacy .PERIOD and  we  have  among  states  a  reluctance  in  dealing  with  them .PERIOD plus ,COMMA during  the  last  decade ,COMMA we've  been  in  the  mode  where  dealing  with  groups  was  conceptually  and  politically  dangerous .PERIOD after  9/11 ,COMMA either  you  were  with  us  or  against  us .PERIOD it  was  black  or  white .PERIOD and  groups  are  very  often  immediately  label  terrorists .PERIOD and  who  would  talk  to  terrorists ?QUESTIONMARK the  west ,COMMA as  i  would  see  it ,COMMA comes  out  of  that  decade  weakened ,COMMA because  we  did  n't  understand  the  group .PERIOD so  we've  spent  more  time  on  focusing  on  why  we  should  not  talk  to  others  than  finding  out  how  we  talk  to  others .PERIOD now  i  'm  not  naive .PERIOD you  cannot  talk  to  everybody  all  the  time .PERIOD and  there  are  times  you  should  walk .PERIOD and  sometimes  military  intervention  is  necessary .PERIOD i  happen  to  believe  that  libya  was  necessary  and  that  military  intervention  in  afghanistan  was  also  necessary .PERIOD and  my  country  relies  on  its  security  through  military  alliance ,COMMA that  's  clear .PERIOD but  still  we  have  a  large  deficit  in  dealing  with  and  understanding  modern  conflict .PERIOD let  us  turn  to  afghanistan .PERIOD 10  years  after  that  military  intervention ,COMMA that  country  is  far  from  secure .PERIOD the  situation ,COMMA to  be  honest ,COMMA is  very  serious .PERIOD now  again ,COMMA the  military  is  necessary ,COMMA but  the  military  is  no  problem-solver .PERIOD when  i  first  came  to  afghanistan  in  2005  as  a  foreign  minister ,COMMA i  met  the  commander  of  isaf ,COMMA the  international  troops .PERIOD and  he  told  me  that ,COMMA this  can  be  won  militarily ,COMMA minister .PERIOD we  just  have  to  persevere  now  four  com  isaf  's  later ,COMMA we  hear  a  different  message ,COMMA this  cannot  be  won  militarily .PERIOD we  need  military  presence ,COMMA but  we  need  to  move  to  politics .PERIOD we  can  only  solve  this  through  a  political  solution .PERIOD and  it  is  not  us  who  will  solve  it .PERIOD afghans  have  to  solve  it  but  then  they  need  a  different  political  process  than  the  one  they  were  given  in  2001 ,COMMA 2002 .PERIOD they  need  an  inclusive  process  where  the  real  fabric  of  this  very  complicated  society  can  deal  with  their  issues .PERIOD everybody  seems  to  agree  with  that .PERIOD it  was  very  controversial  to  say  three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five  years  ago .PERIOD now  everybody  agrees .PERIOD but  now ,COMMA as  we  prepare  to  talk ,COMMA we  understand  how  little  we  know .PERIOD because  we  did  n't  talk .PERIOD we  did  n't  grasp  what  was  going  on .PERIOD the  international  committee  of  the  red  cross ,COMMA the  icrc ,COMMA is  talking  to  everyone ,COMMA and  it  is  doing  so  because  it  is  neutral .PERIOD and  that  's  one  reason  why  that  organization  probably  is  the  best  informed  key  player  to  understand  modern  conflict ,COMMA because  they  talk .PERIOD my  point  is  that  you  do  n't  have  to  be  neutral  to  talk .PERIOD and  you  do  n't  have  to  agree  when  you  sit  down  with  the  other  side .PERIOD and  you  can  always  walk .PERIOD but  if  you  do  n't  talk ,COMMA you  cannot  engage  the  other  side .PERIOD and  the  other  side  which  you  're  going  to  engage  is  the  one  with  whom  you  profoundly  disagree .PERIOD prime  minister  rabin  said  when  he  engaged  the  oslo  process ,COMMA you  do  n't  make  peace  with  your  friends ,COMMA you  make  peace  with  your  enemies  it  's  hard ,COMMA but  it  is  necessary .PERIOD let  me  go  one  step  further .PERIOD this  is  tahrir  square .PERIOD there  's  a  revolution  going  on .PERIOD the  arab  spring  is  heading  into  fall  and  is  moving  into  winter .PERIOD it  will  last  for  a  long ,COMMA long  time .PERIOD and  who  knows  what  it  will  be  called  in  the  end .PERIOD that  's  not  the  point .PERIOD the  point  is  that  we  are  probably  seeing ,COMMA for  the  first  time  in  the  history  of  the  arab  world ,COMMA a  revolution  bottom-up ,COMMA people  's  revolution .PERIOD social  groups  are  taking  to  the  streets .PERIOD and  we  find  out  in  the  west  that  we  know  very  little  about  what  's  happening .PERIOD because  we  never  talk  to  the  people  in  these  countries .PERIOD most  governments  followed  the  dictate  of  the  authoritarian  leaders  to  stay  away  from  these  different  groups ,COMMA because  they  were  terrorists .PERIOD so  now  that  they  are  emerging  in  the  street  and  we  salute  the  democratic  revolution ,COMMA we  find  out  how  little  we  know .PERIOD right  now ,COMMA the  discussion  goes ,COMMA should  we  talk  to  the  muslim  brotherhood ?QUESTIONMARK should  we  talk  to  hamas ?QUESTIONMARK if  we  talk  to  them ,COMMA we  may  legitimize  them  i  think  that  is  wrong .PERIOD if  you  talk  in  the  right  way ,COMMA you  make  it  very  clear  that  talking  is  not  agreeing .PERIOD and  how  can  we  tell  the  muslim  brotherhood ,COMMA as  we  should ,COMMA that  they  must  respect  minority  rights ,COMMA if  we  do  n't  accept  majority  rights ?QUESTIONMARK because  they  may  turn  out  to  be  a  majority .PERIOD how  can  we  escape  having  a  double-standard ,COMMA if  we  at  the  same  time  preach  democracy  and  at  the  same  time  do  n't  want  to  deal  with  the  groups  that  are  representative ?QUESTIONMARK how  will  we  ever  be  interlocutors ?QUESTIONMARK now  my  diplomats  are  instructed  to  talk  to  all  these  groups .PERIOD but  talking  can  be  done  in  different  ways .PERIOD we  make  a  distinction  between  talking  from  a  diplomatic  level  and  talking  at  the  political  level .PERIOD now  talking  can  be  accompanied  with  aid  or  not  with  aid .PERIOD talking  can  be  accompanied  with  inclusion  or  not  inclusion .PERIOD there  's  a  big  array  of  the  ways  of  dealing  with  this .PERIOD so  if  we  refuse  to  talk  to  these  new  groups  that  are  going  to  be  dominating  the  news  in  years  to  come ,COMMA we  will  further  radicalization ,COMMA i  believe .PERIOD we  will  make  the  road  from  violent  activities  into  politics  harder  to  travel .PERIOD and  if  we  cannot  demonstrate  to  these  groups  that  if  you  move  towards  democracy ,COMMA if  you  move  towards  taking  part  in  civilized  and  normal  standards  among  states ,COMMA there  are  some  rewards  on  the  other  side .PERIOD the  paradox  here  is  that  the  last  decade  probably  was  a  lost  decade  for  making  progress  on  this .PERIOD and  the  paradox  is  that  the  decade  before  the  last  decade  was  so  promising ,COMMA and  for  one  reason  primarily .PERIOD and  the  reason  is  what  happened  in  south  africa ,COMMA nelson  mandela .PERIOD when  mandela  came  out  of  prison  after  27  years  of  captivity ,COMMA if  he  had  told  his  people ,COMMA it  's  time  to  take  up  the  arms ,COMMA it  's  time  to  fight ,COMMA he  would  have  been  followed .PERIOD and  i  think  the  international  community  would  have  said ,COMMA fair  enough .PERIOD it  's  their  right  to  fight  now  as  you  know ,COMMA mandela  did  n't  do  that .PERIOD in  his  memoirs ,COMMA long  road  to  freedom ,COMMA he  wrote  that  he  survived  during  those  years  of  captivity  because  he  always  decided  to  look  upon  his  oppressor  as  also  being  a  human  being ,COMMA also  being  a  human  being .PERIOD so  he  engaged  a  political  process  of  dialogue ,COMMA not  as  a  strategy  of  the  weak ,COMMA but  as  a  strategy  of  the  strong .PERIOD and  he  engaged  talking  profoundly  by  settling  some  of  the  most  tricky  issues  through  a  truth  and  reconciliation  process  where  people  came  and  talked .PERIOD now  south  african  friends  will  know  that  was  very  painful .PERIOD so  what  can  we  learn  from  all  of  this ?QUESTIONMARK dialogue  is  not  easy ,COMMA not  between  individuals ,COMMA not  between  groups ,COMMA not  between  governments ,COMMA but  it  is  very  necessary .PERIOD if  we  're  going  to  deal  with  political  conflict-solving  of  conflicts ,COMMA if  we  're  going  to  understand  these  new  groups  which  are  coming  from  bottom-up ,COMMA supported  by  technology ,COMMA which  is  available  to  all ,COMMA we  diplomats  cannot  be  sitting  back  in  the  banquets  believing  that  we  are  doing  interstate  relations .PERIOD we  have  to  connect  with  these  profound  changes .PERIOD and  what  is  dialogue  really  about ?QUESTIONMARK when  i  enter  into  dialogue ,COMMA i  really  hope  that  the  other  side  would  pick  up  my  points  of  view ,COMMA that  i  would  impress  upon  them  my  opinions  and  my  values .PERIOD i  cannot  do  that  unless  i  send  the  signals  that  i  will  be  open  to  listen  to  the  other  side  's  signals .PERIOD we  need  a  lot  more  training  on  how  to  do  that  and  a  lot  more  practice  on  how  that  can  take  problem-solving  forward .PERIOD we  know  from  our  personal  experiences  that  it  's  easy  sometimes  just  to  walk ,COMMA and  sometimes  you  may  need  to  fight .PERIOD and  i  would  n't  say  that  is  the  wrong  thing  in  all  circumstances .PERIOD sometimes  you  have  to .PERIOD but  that  strategy  seldom  takes  you  very  far .PERIOD the  alternative  is  a  strategy  of  engagement  and  principled  dialogue .PERIOD and  i  believe  we  need  to  strengthen  this  approach  in  modern  diplomacy ,COMMA not  only  between  states ,COMMA but  also  within  states .PERIOD we  are  seeing  some  new  signs .PERIOD we  could  never  have  done  the  convention  against  anti-personnel  landmines  and  the  convention  that  is  banning  cluster  munitions  unless  we  had  done  diplomacy  differently ,COMMA by  engaging  with  civil  society .PERIOD all  of  a  sudden ,COMMA ngos  were  not  only  standing  in  the  streets ,COMMA crying  their  slogans ,COMMA but  they  were  taking  them  into  the  negotiations ,COMMA partly  because  they  represented  the  victims  of  these  weapons .PERIOD and  they  brought  their  knowledge .PERIOD and  there  was  an  interaction  between  diplomacy  and  the  power  coming  bottom-up .PERIOD this  is  perhaps  a  first  element  of  a  change .PERIOD in  the  future ,COMMA i  believe ,COMMA we  should  draw  examples  from  these  different  illustrations ,COMMA not  to  have  diplomacy  which  is  disconnected  from  people  and  civil  society .PERIOD and  we  have  to  go  also  beyond  traditional  diplomacy  to  the  survival  issue  of  our  times ,COMMA climate  change .PERIOD how  are  we  going  to  solve  climate  change  through  negotiations ,COMMA unless  we  are  able  to  make  civil  society  and  people ,COMMA not  part  of  the  problem ,COMMA but  part  of  the  solution ?QUESTIONMARK it  is  going  to  demand  an  inclusive  process  of  diplomacy  very  different  from  the  one  we  are  practicing  today  as  we  are  heading  to  new  rounds  of  difficult  climate  negotiations ,COMMA but  when  we  move  toward  something  which  has  to  be  much  more  along  a  broad  mobilization .PERIOD it  's  crucial  to  understand ,COMMA i  believe ,COMMA because  of  technology  and  because  of  globalization ,COMMA societies  from  bottom-up .PERIOD we  as  diplomats  need  to  know  the  social  capital  of  communities .PERIOD what  is  it  that  makes  people  trust  each  other ,COMMA not  only  between  states ,COMMA but  also  within  states ?QUESTIONMARK what  is  the  legitimacy  of  diplomacy ,COMMA of  the  the  solution  we  devise  as  diplomats  if  they  cannot  be  reflected  and  understood  by  also  these  broader  forces  of  societies  that  we  now  very  loosely  call  groups ?QUESTIONMARK the  good  thing  is  that  we  are  not  powerless .PERIOD we  have  never  had  as  many  means  of  communication ,COMMA means  of  being  connected ,COMMA means  of  reaching  out ,COMMA means  of  including .PERIOD the  diplomatic  toolbox  is  actually  full  of  different  tools  we  can  use  to  strengthen  our  communication .PERIOD but  the  problem  is  that  we  are  coming  out  of  a  decade  where  we  had  a  fear  of  touching  it .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  hope ,COMMA in  the  coming  years ,COMMA that  we  are  able  to  demonstrate  through  some  concrete  examples  that  fear  is  receding  and  that  we  can  take  courage  from  that  alliance  with  civil  society  in  different  countries  to  support  their  problem-solving ,COMMA among  the  afghans ,COMMA inside  the  palestinian  population ,COMMA between  the  peoples  of  palestine  and  israel .PERIOD and  as  we  try  to  understand  this  broad  movement  across  the  arab  world ,COMMA we  are  not  powerless .PERIOD we  need  to  improve  the  necessary  skills ,COMMA and  we  need  the  courage  to  use  them .PERIOD in  my  country ,COMMA i  have  seen  how  the  council  of  islamist  groups  and  christian  groups  came  together ,COMMA not  as  a  government  initiative ,COMMA but  they  came  together  on  their  own  initiative  to  establish  contact  and  dialogue  in  times  where  things  were  pretty  low-key  tension .PERIOD and  when  tension  increased ,COMMA they  already  had  that  dialogue ,COMMA and  that  was  a  strength  to  deal  with  different  issues .PERIOD our  modern  western  societies  are  more  complex  than  before ,COMMA in  this  time  of  migration .PERIOD how  are  we  going  to  settle  and  build  a  bigger  we  to  deal  with  our  issues  if  we  do  n't  improve  our  skills  of  communication ?QUESTIONMARK so  there  are  many  reasons ,COMMA and  for  all  of  these  reasons ,COMMA this  is  time  and  this  is  why  we  must  talk .PERIOD thank  you  for  your  attention .PERIOD i  'm  often  asked ,COMMA what  surprises  you  about  the  book ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  said ,COMMA that  i  got  to  write  it .PERIOD i  would  have  never  imagined  that ,COMMA not  in  my  wildest  dreams  did  i  think ,COMMA i  do  n't  even  consider  myself  to  be  an  author .PERIOD and  i  'm  often  asked ,COMMA why  do  you  think  so  many  people  have  read  this ?QUESTIONMARK this  thing  's  selling  still  about  a  million  copies  a  month .PERIOD and  i  think  it  's  because  spiritual  emptiness  is  a  universal  disease .PERIOD i  think  inside  at  some  point ,COMMA we  put  our  heads  down  on  the  pillow  and  we  go ,COMMA there  's  got  to  be  more  to  life  than  this .PERIOD get  up  in  the  morning ,COMMA go  to  work ,COMMA come  home  and  watch  tv ,COMMA go  to  bed ,COMMA get  up  in  the  morning ,COMMA go  to  work ,COMMA come  home ,COMMA watch  tv ,COMMA go  to  bed ,COMMA go  to  parties  on  weekends .PERIOD a  lot  of  people  say ,COMMA i  'm  living  no ,COMMA you  're  not  living ,COMMA that  's  just  existing .PERIOD just  existing .PERIOD i  really  think  that  's  there  's  this  inner  desire .PERIOD i  do  believe  what  chris  said .PERIOD i  believe  that  you  're  not  an  accident .PERIOD your  parents  may  not  have  planned  you ,COMMA but  i  believe  god  did .PERIOD i  think  there  are  accidental  parents .PERIOD there  's  no  doubt  about  that .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  there  are  accidental  kids .PERIOD and  i  think  you  matter .PERIOD i  think  you  matter  to  god .PERIOD i  think  you  matter  to  history .PERIOD i  think  you  matter  to  this  universe .PERIOD and  i  think  that  the  difference  between  what  i  call  the  survival  level  of  living ,COMMA the  success  level  of  living  and  the  significant  level  of  living  is ,COMMA do  you  figure  out ,COMMA what  on  earth  am  i  here  for ?QUESTIONMARK i  meet  a  lot  of  people  who  are  very  smart ,COMMA and  say ,COMMA but  why  cannot  i  figure  out  my  problems ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  meet  a  lot  of  people  who  are  very  successful ,COMMA who  say ,COMMA why  do  n't  i  feel  more  fulfilled ?QUESTIONMARK why  do  i  feel  like  a  fake ?QUESTIONMARK why  do  i  feel  like  i've  got  to  pretend  that  i  'm  more  than  i  really  am ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  that  comes  down  to  this  issue  of  meaning ,COMMA of  significance ,COMMA of  purpose .PERIOD i  think  it  comes  down  to  this  issue  of ,COMMA why  am  i  here ?QUESTIONMARK what  am  i  here  for ?QUESTIONMARK where  am  i  going ?QUESTIONMARK these  are  not  religious  issues ,COMMA they  're  human  issues .PERIOD i  wanted  to  tell  michael  before  he  spoke  that  i  really  appreciate

,COMMA dumb  kooks .PERIOD there  are  people ,COMMA a  lady  came  up  to  me  the  other  day ,COMMA and  she  had  a  white  piece  of  paper ,COMMA michael ,COMMA you  'll  like  this  one ,COMMA and  she  said ,COMMA what  do  you  see  in  it ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  looked  at  it  and  i  said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i  do  n't  see  anything .PERIOD and  she  goes ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  see  jesus ,COMMA and  started  crying  and  left .PERIOD i  'm  going ,COMMA ok ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD fine .PERIOD um .PERIOD when  the  book  became  the  best-selling  book  in  the  world  for  the  last  three  years ,COMMA i  kind  of  had  my  little  crisis .PERIOD and  that  was ,COMMA what  is  the  purpose  of  this ?QUESTIONMARK because  it  brought  in  enormous  amounts  of  money .PERIOD when  you  write  the  best-selling  book  in  the  world ,COMMA it  's  tons  and  tons  of  money  -- .PERIOD and  it  brought  in  a  lot  of  attention ,COMMA neither  of  which  i  wanted .PERIOD when  i  started  saddleback  church ,COMMA i  was  25  years  old .PERIOD i  started  it  with  one  other  family  in  1980 .PERIOD and  i  decided  that  i  was  never  going  to  go  on  tv ,COMMA because  i  did  n't  want  to  be  a  celebrity ,COMMA i  did  n't  want  to  be  a ,COMMA quote ,COMMA evangelist ,COMMA televangelist ,COMMA that  's  not  my  thing .PERIOD and  all  of  a  sudden ,COMMA it  brought  a  lot  of  money  and  a  lot  of  attention .PERIOD i  do  n't  think ,COMMA now ,COMMA this  is  a  worldview ,COMMA and  i  will  tell  you ,COMMA everybody  's  got  a

know ,COMMA i  had  no  plans  to  do  what  it  's  doing  now .PERIOD and  then  when  i  wrote  this  book ,COMMA and  all  of  a  sudden  it  just  took  off ,COMMA then  i  started  saying ,COMMA now ,COMMA what  's  the  purpose  of  this ?QUESTIONMARK because  as  i  started  to  say ,COMMA i  do  n't  think  you  're  given  money  or  fame  for  your  own  ego ,COMMA ever .PERIOD i  just  do  n't  believe  that .PERIOD and  when  you  write  a  book  that  the  first  sentence  of  the  book  is ,COMMA it  's  not  about  you ,COMMA then ,COMMA when  all  of  a  sudden  it  becomes  the  best-selling  book  in  history ,COMMA you  got  to  figure ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  guess  it  's  not  about  me .PERIOD that  's  kind  of  a  no-brainer .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  is  it  for ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  began  to  think  about  what  i  call  the  stewardship  of  affluence  and  the  stewardship  of  influence .PERIOD so  i  believe ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA that  leadership  is  stewardship .PERIOD that  if  you  are  a  leader  in  any  area ,COMMA in  business ,COMMA in  politics ,COMMA in  sports ,COMMA in  art ,COMMA in  academics ,COMMA in  any  area ,COMMA you  do

 you  believe  that  human  beings  are  responsible  to  make  the  world  a  little  bit  better  place  for  the  next  generation ?QUESTIONMARK do  you  think  we  have  a  stewardship  here ,COMMA to  take  the  environment  seriously ?QUESTIONMARK and  he  said ,COMMA no .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you  do  n't  i  said ,COMMA let  me  make  this  clear  again .PERIOD do  you  believe  that  as  human  beings ,COMMA i  'm  not  talking  about  religion ,COMMA do  you  believe  that  as  human  beings ,COMMA it  is  our  responsibility  to  take  care  of  this  planet  and  make  it  just  a  little  bit  better  for  the  next  generation ?QUESTIONMARK and  he  said ,COMMA no .PERIOD not  any  more  than  any  other  species .PERIOD when  he  said  the  word  species ,COMMA he  was  revealing  his  worldview .PERIOD and  he  was  saying ,COMMA i  'm  no  more  responsible  to  take  care  of  this  environment  than  a  duck  is .PERIOD well  now ,COMMA i  know  a

need  to  understand  what  your  worldview  is .PERIOD the  problem  is  most  people  never  really  think  it  through .PERIOD they  never  really  codify  it  or  qualify  it  or  quantify  it ,COMMA and  say ,COMMA this  is  what  i  believe  in .PERIOD this  is  why  i  believe  what  i  believe .PERIOD i  do  n't  personally  have  enough  faith  to  be  an  atheist .PERIOD but  you  may ,COMMA you  may .PERIOD your  worldview ,COMMA though ,COMMA does  determine  everything  else  in  your  life ,COMMA because  it  determines  your  decisions .PERIOD it  determines  your

,COMMA we  're  not  going  to  use  it  on  ourselves .PERIOD i  did  n't  go  out  and  buy  a  bigger  house .PERIOD i  do  n't  own  a  guesthouse .PERIOD i  still  drive  the  same  four-year-old

it  for  money .PERIOD i  know  that  's  a  stereotype .PERIOD i've  never  met  one  of  them .PERIOD believe  me ,COMMA there  's  a  whole  lot  easier  ways  to  make  money .PERIOD pastors  are  like  on  24-hours-a-day  call .PERIOD they  're  like  doctors .PERIOD i  left  late  today .PERIOD i'd  hoped  to  be  here  yesterday ,COMMA because  my  father-in-law  is  in  his  last ,COMMA

.PERIOD you  know ,COMMA the  test  of  your  worldview  is  not  how  you  act  in  the  good  times .PERIOD the  test  of  your  worldview  is  how  you  act  at  the  funeral .PERIOD and  having  been  through  literally  hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  funerals ,COMMA it  makes  a  difference .PERIOD it  makes  a  difference  what  you  believe .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  gave  it  all  back ,COMMA and  then  we  set  up  three  foundations ,COMMA working  on  some  of  the  major  problems  of  the  world ,COMMA illiteracy ,COMMA poverty ,COMMA pandemic  diseases ,COMMA particularly  hiv/aids ,COMMA and  set  up  these  three  foundations ,COMMA and  put  the  money  into  that .PERIOD the  last  thing  we  did  is  we  became  what  i  call  reverse  tithers .PERIOD and  that  is ,COMMA when  my  wife  and  i  got  married  30  years  ago ,COMMA we  started  tithing .PERIOD now ,COMMA that  's  a  principle  in  the  bible  that  says  give  10  percent  of  what  you  get  back  to  charity ,COMMA give  it  away  to  help  other  people .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  started  doing  that ,COMMA and  each  year  we  would  raise  our  tithe  1  percent .PERIOD so ,COMMA our  first  year  of  marriage  we  went  to  11  percent ,COMMA second  year  we  went  to  12  percent ,COMMA and  the  third  year  we  went  to  13  percent ,COMMA and  on  and  on  and  on .PERIOD why  did  i  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK because  every  time  i  give ,COMMA it  breaks  the  grip  of  materialism  in  my  life .PERIOD materialism  is  all  about  getting ,COMMA get ,COMMA get ,COMMA get ,COMMA get  all  you  can ,COMMA can  all  you  get ,COMMA sit  on  the  can  and  spoil  the  rest .PERIOD it  's  all  about  more ,COMMA having  more .PERIOD and  we  think  that  the  good  life

meet  people  all  the  time  who  have  those ,COMMA and  they  're  not  necessarily  happy .PERIOD if  money  actually  made  you  happy ,COMMA then  the  wealthiest  people  in  the  world  would  be  the  happiest .PERIOD and  that  i  know ,COMMA personally ,COMMA i  know ,COMMA is  not  true .PERIOD it  's  just  not  true .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  good  life  is  not  about  looking  good ,COMMA feeling  good  or  having  the  goods .PERIOD it  's  about  being  good  and  doing  good .PERIOD giving  your  life  away .PERIOD significance  in  life  does  n't  come  from  status ,COMMA because  you  can  always  find  somebody  who  's  got  more  than  you .PERIOD it  does  n't  come  from  sex .PERIOD it  does  n't  come  from  salary .PERIOD it  comes  from  serving .PERIOD it  is  in  giving  our  lives  away  that  we  find  meaning ,COMMA we  find  significance .PERIOD that  's  the  way  we  were  wired ,COMMA i  believe ,COMMA by  god .PERIOD and  so  we  began  to  give  away ,COMMA and  now  after  30  years ,COMMA my  wife  and  i  are  reverse  tithers ,COMMA we  give  away  90  percent  and  live  on  10 .PERIOD that ,COMMA actually ,COMMA was  the  easy  part .PERIOD the  hard  part  is ,COMMA what  do  i  do  with  all  this  attention ?QUESTIONMARK because  i  start  getting  all  kinds  of  invitations .PERIOD i  just  came  off  a  nearly  month-long  speaking  tour  on  three  different  continents ,COMMA and  i  wo  n't  go  into  that ,COMMA but  it  was  an  amazing  thing .PERIOD and  i  'm  going ,COMMA what  do  i  do  with  this  notoriety  that  the  book  has  brought ?QUESTIONMARK and  being  a  pastor ,COMMA i  started  reading  the  bible .PERIOD there  's  a  chapter  in  the  bible  called  psalm  72 ,COMMA and  it  's  solomon  's  prayer  for  more  influence .PERIOD when  you  read  this  prayer ,COMMA it  sounds  incredibly  selfish ,COMMA self-centered .PERIOD it  sounds  like ,COMMA he  says ,COMMA god ,COMMA i  want  you  to  make  me  famous .PERIOD that  's  what  he  prays .PERIOD he  says ,COMMA i  want  you  to  make  me  famous .PERIOD i  want  you  to  spread  the  fame  of  my  name  through  every  land .PERIOD i  want  you  to  give  me  power .PERIOD i  want  you  to  make  me  famous .PERIOD i  want  you  to  give  me  influence .PERIOD and  it  just  sounds  like  the  most  egotistical  request  you  could  make  if  you  were  going  to  pray .PERIOD until  you  read  the  whole  psalm ,COMMA the  whole  chapter .PERIOD and  then  he  says ,COMMA so  that  the  king ,COMMA he  was  the  king  of  israel  at  that  time  at  its  apex  in  power ,COMMA so  that  the  king  may  care  for  the  widow  and  orphan ,COMMA support  depressed ,COMMA defend  the  defenseless ,COMMA care  for  the  sick ,COMMA assist  the  poor ,COMMA speak  up  for  the  foreigner ,COMMA those  in  prison .PERIOD basically ,COMMA he  's  talking  about  all  the  marginalized  in  society .PERIOD and  as  i  read  that ,COMMA i  looked  at  it ,COMMA and  i  thought ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA what  this  is  saying  is  that  the  purpose  of  influence  is  to  speak  up  for  those  who  have  no  influence .PERIOD the  purpose  of  influence  is  not  to  build  your  ego ,COMMA or  your  net  worth .PERIOD and ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA your  net  worth  is  not  the  same  thing  as  your  self-worth .PERIOD your  value  is  not  based  on  your  valuables .PERIOD it  's  based  on  a  whole  different  set  of  things .PERIOD and  so  the  purpose  of  influence  is  to  speak  up  for  those  who  have  no  influence .PERIOD and  i  had  to  admit ,COMMA i  cannot  think  of  the  last  time  i  thought  of  widows  and  orphans .PERIOD they  're  not  on  my  radar .PERIOD i  pastor  a  church  in  one  of  the  most  affluent  areas  of  america ,COMMA a  bunch  of  gated  communities .PERIOD i  have  a  church  full  of  ceos  and  scientists .PERIOD

.PERIOD so ,COMMA i  had  to  say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA i  would  use  whatever  affluence  and  whatever  influence  i've  got  to  help  those  who  do  n't  have  either  of  those .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA there  's  a  story  in  the  bible  about  moses .PERIOD whether  you  believe  it  's  true  or  not ,COMMA it  really  did  n't  matter  to  me .PERIOD but  moses ,COMMA if  you  saw  the  movie ,COMMA the  ten  commandments ,COMMA moses  goes  out ,COMMA and  there  's  this  burning  bush ,COMMA and  god  talks  to  him .PERIOD and  god  says ,COMMA moses ,COMMA what  's  in  your  hand ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  that  's  one  of  the  most  important  questions  you  'll  ever  be  asked .PERIOD what  's  in  your  hand ?QUESTIONMARK moses  says ,COMMA it  's  a  staff .PERIOD it  's  a  shepherd  's  staff .PERIOD and  god  says ,COMMA throw  it  down .PERIOD and  if  you  saw  the  movie ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA he  throws  it  down  and  it  becomes  a  snake .PERIOD and  then  god  says ,COMMA pick  it  up .PERIOD and  he  picks  it  back  up  again ,COMMA and  it  becomes  a  staff  again .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  'm  reading  this  thing ,COMMA and  i  'm  going ,COMMA what  is  that  all  about ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD what  's  that  all  about ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA i  do  know  a  couple  of  things .PERIOD number  one ,COMMA god  never  does  a  miracle  to  show  off .PERIOD it  's  not  just ,COMMA wow ,COMMA is  n't  that  cool ?QUESTIONMARK and ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA my  god  does  n't  have  to  show  up  on  cheese  bread .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA if  god  's  going  to  show  up ,COMMA he  's  not  going  to  show  up  on  cheese  bread .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK i  just ,COMMA this  is  why  i  love  what  michael  does ,COMMA because  it  's  like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA if  he  's  debunking  it ,COMMA then  i  do  n't  have  to .PERIOD but  god ,COMMA my  god ,COMMA does  n't  show  up  on  sprinkler  images .PERIOD he  got  a  few  more  powerful  ways  than  that  to  do  whatever  he  wants  to  do .PERIOD but  he  does  n't  do  miracles  just  to  show  off .PERIOD second  thing  is ,COMMA if  god  ever  asks  you  a  question ,COMMA he  already  knows  the  answer .PERIOD obviously ,COMMA if  he  's  god ,COMMA then  that  would  mean  that  when  he  asks  the  question ,COMMA it  's  for  your  benefit ,COMMA not  his .PERIOD so ,COMMA he  's  going ,COMMA what  's  in  your  hand ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA what  was  in  moses  hand ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA it  was  a  shepherd  's  staff .PERIOD now ,COMMA follow  me  on  this .PERIOD this  staff  represented  three  things  about  moses  life .PERIOD first ,COMMA it  represented  his  identity .PERIOD he  was  a  shepherd .PERIOD it  's  the  symbol  of  his  own  occupation .PERIOD i  am  a  shepherd .PERIOD it  's  a  symbol  of  his  identity ,COMMA his  career ,COMMA his  job .PERIOD second ,COMMA it  's  a  symbol  of  not  only  his  identity .PERIOD it  's  a  symbol  of  his  income ,COMMA because  all  of  his  assets  are  tied  up  in  sheep .PERIOD in  those  days  nobody  had  bank  accounts ,COMMA or  american  express  cards ,COMMA or  hedge  funds .PERIOD your  assets  are  tied  up  in  your  flocks .PERIOD so  it  's  a  symbol  of  his  identity ,COMMA and  it  's  a  symbol  of  his  income .PERIOD and  the  third  thing ,COMMA it  's  a  symbol  of  his  influence .PERIOD what  do  you  do  with  a  shepherd  's  staff ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  move  sheep  from  point  a  to  point  b  with  it ,COMMA by  hook  or  by  crook .PERIOD you  pull  them  or  you  poke  them ,COMMA one  or  the  other .PERIOD so ,COMMA he  's  saying ,COMMA you  're  going  to  lay  down  your  identity .PERIOD what  's  in  your  hand ?QUESTIONMARK you've  got  identity .PERIOD you've  got  income .PERIOD you've  got  influence .PERIOD what  's  in  your  hand ?QUESTIONMARK and  he  's  saying ,COMMA if  you  lay  it  down ,COMMA i  'll  make  it  come  alive .PERIOD i  'll  do  some  things  you  could  never  imagine  possible .PERIOD and  if  you've  watched  that  movie ,COMMA ten  commandments ,COMMA all  of  those  big  miracles  that  happen  in  egypt  are  done  through  this  staff .PERIOD last  year ,COMMA i  was  invited  to  speak  at  nba  all-stars  game .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA i  'm  talking  to  the  players ,COMMA because  most  of  the  nba  teams ,COMMA nfl  teams  and  all  the  other  teams  have  done  this  40  days  of  purpose ,COMMA based  on  the  book .PERIOD and  i  asked  them ,COMMA i  said ,COMMA what  's  in  your  hand ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA what  's  in  your  hand  i  said ,COMMA it  's  a  basketball ,COMMA and  that  basketball  represents  your  identity ,COMMA who  you  are .PERIOD you  're  an  nba  player .PERIOD it  represents  your  income .PERIOD you  're  making  a  lot  of  money  off  that  little  ball .PERIOD and  it  represents  your  influence .PERIOD and  even  though  you  're  only  going  to  be  in  the  nba  for  a  few  years ,COMMA you  're  going  to  be  an  nba  player  for  the  rest  of  your  life .PERIOD and  that  gives  with  you  enormous  influence .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  are  you  going  to  do  with  what  you've  been  given ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  guess  that  's  the  main  reason  i  came  up  here  today ,COMMA to  all  of  you  very  bright  people  at  ted ,COMMA is  to  say ,COMMA what  's  in  your  hand ?QUESTIONMARK what  do  you  have  that  you've  been  given ?QUESTIONMARK talent ,COMMA background ,COMMA education ,COMMA freedom ,COMMA networks ,COMMA opportunities ,COMMA wealth ,COMMA ideas ,COMMA creativity .PERIOD what  are  you  doing  with  what  you've  been  given ?QUESTIONMARK that ,COMMA to  me ,COMMA is  the  primary  question  about  life .PERIOD that ,COMMA to  me ,COMMA is  what  being  purpose-driven  is  all  about .PERIOD in  the  book  i  talk  about  how  you  're  wired  to  do  certain  things ,COMMA you  're  shaped .PERIOD this  little  cross  takes  spiritual  gifts ,COMMA heart ,COMMA ability ,COMMA personality  and  experiences .PERIOD these  things  shape  you .PERIOD and  if  you  want  to  know  what  you  ought  to  be  doing  with  your  life ,COMMA you  need  to  look  at  your  shape .PERIOD what  am  i  wired  to  do ?QUESTIONMARK why  would  god  wire  you  to  do  something  and  then  not  have  you  do  it ?QUESTIONMARK if  you  're  wired  to  be  an  anthropologist ,COMMA you  'll  be  an  anthropologist .PERIOD if  you  're  wired  to  be  an  undersea  explorer ,COMMA you  'll  be  an  undersea  explorer .PERIOD if  you  're  wired  to  make  deals ,COMMA you  make  deals .PERIOD if  you  're  wired  to  paint ,COMMA you  paint .PERIOD did  you  know  that  god  smiles  when  you  be  you ?QUESTIONMARK when  my  little  kids  were  little ,COMMA they  're  all  grown ,COMMA now  i  have  grandkids ,COMMA i  used  to  go  in  and  sit  on  the  side  of  their  bed ,COMMA and  i  used  to  watch  my  kids  sleep .PERIOD and  i  just  watched  their  little  bodies  rise  and  lower ,COMMA rise  and  lower .PERIOD and  i  would  look  at  them ,COMMA this  is  not  an  accident .PERIOD rise  and  lower  -- .PERIOD and  i  got  joy  out  of  just  watching  them  sleep .PERIOD some  people  have  the  misguided  idea  that  god  only  gets  excited  when  you  're  doing ,COMMA quote ,COMMA spiritual  things ,COMMA like  going  to  church  or  helping  the  poor ,COMMA or ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA confessing  or  doing  something  like  that .PERIOD the  bottom  line  is ,COMMA god  gets  pleasure  watching  you  be  you .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK he  made  you .PERIOD and  when  you  do  what  you  were  made  to  do ,COMMA he  goes ,COMMA that  's  my  boy .PERIOD that  's  my  girl .PERIOD you  're  using  the  talent  and  ability  that  i  gave  you .PERIOD so  my  advice  to  you  is ,COMMA look  at  what  's  in  your  hand ,COMMA your  identity ,COMMA your  influence ,COMMA your  income ,COMMA and  say ,COMMA it  's  not  about  me .PERIOD it  's  about  making  the  world  a  better  place .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD so  i  'm  here  to  explain  why  i  'm  wearing  these  ninja  pajamas .PERIOD and  to  do  that ,COMMA i'd  like  to  talk  first  about  environmental  toxins  in  our  bodies .PERIOD so  some  of  you  may  know  about  the  chemical  bisphenol  a ,COMMA bpa .PERIOD it  's  a  material  hardener  and  synthetic  estrogen  that  's  found  in  the  lining  of  canned  foods  and  some  plastics .PERIOD so  bpa  mimics  the  body  's  own  hormones  and  causes  neurological  and  reproductive  problems .PERIOD and  it  's  everywhere .PERIOD a  recent  study  found  bpa  in  93  percent  of  people  six  and  older .PERIOD but  it  's  just  one  chemical .PERIOD the  center  for  disease  control  in  the  us .PERIOD says  we  have  219  toxic  pollutants  in  our  bodies ,COMMA and  this  includes  preservatives ,COMMA pesticides  and  heavy  metals  like  lead  and  mercury .PERIOD to  me ,COMMA this  says  three  things .PERIOD first ,COMMA do  n't  become  a  cannibal .PERIOD second ,COMMA we  are  both  responsible  for  and  the  victims  of  our  own  pollution .PERIOD and  third ,COMMA our  bodies  are  filters  and  storehouses  for  environmental  toxins .PERIOD so  what  happens  to  all  these  toxins  when  we  die ?QUESTIONMARK the  short  answer  is ,COMMA they  return  to  the  environment  in  one  way  or  another ,COMMA continuing  the  cycle  of  toxicity .PERIOD but  our  current  funeral  practices  make  the  situation  much  worse .PERIOD if  you  're  cremated ,COMMA all  those  toxins  i  mentioned  are  released  into  the  atmosphere .PERIOD and  this  includes  5,000  pounds  of  mercury  from  our  dental  fillings  alone  every  year .PERIOD and  in  a  traditional  american  funeral ,COMMA a  dead  body  is  covered  with  fillers  and  cosmetics  to  make  it  look  alive .PERIOD it  's  then  pumped  with  toxic  formaldehyde  to  slow  decomposition ,COMMA a  practice  which  causes  respiratory  problems  and  cancer  in  funeral  personnel .PERIOD so  by  trying  to  preserve  our  dead  bodies ,COMMA we  deny  death ,COMMA poison  the  living  and  further  harm  the  environment .PERIOD green  or  natural  burials ,COMMA which  do  n't  use  embalming ,COMMA are  a  step  in  the  right  direction ,COMMA but  they  do  n't  address  the  existing  toxins  in  our  bodies .PERIOD i  think  there  's  a  better  solution .PERIOD i  'm  an  artist ,COMMA so  i'd  like  to  offer  a  modest  proposal  at  the  intersection  of  art ,COMMA science  and  culture .PERIOD the  infinity  burial  project ,COMMA an  alternative  burial  system  that  uses  mushrooms  to  decompose  and  clean  toxins  in  bodies .PERIOD the  infinity  burial  project  began  a  few  years  ago  with  a  fantasy  to  create  the  infinity  mushroom ,COMMA a  new  hybrid  mushroom  that  would  decompose  bodies ,COMMA clean  the  toxins  and  deliver  nutrients  to  plant  roots ,COMMA leaving  clean  compost .PERIOD but  i  learned  it  's  nearly  impossible  to  create  a  new  hybrid  mushroom .PERIOD i  also  learned  that  some  of  our  tastiest  mushrooms  can  clean  environmental  toxins  in  soil .PERIOD so  i  thought  maybe  i  could  train  an  army  of  toxin-cleaning  edible  mushrooms  to  eat  my  body .PERIOD so  today ,COMMA i  'm  collecting  what  i  shed  or  slough  off ,COMMA my  hair ,COMMA skin  and  nails ,COMMA and  i  'm  feeding  these  to  edible  mushrooms .PERIOD as  the  mushrooms  grow ,COMMA i  pick  the  best  feeders  to  become  infinity  mushrooms .PERIOD it  's  a  kind  of  imprinting  and  selective  breeding  process  for  the  afterlife .PERIOD so  when  i  die ,COMMA the  infinity  mushrooms  will  recognize  my  body  and  be  able  to  eat  it .PERIOD all  right ,COMMA so  for  some  of  you ,COMMA this  may  be  really ,COMMA really  out  there .PERIOD just  a  little .PERIOD i  realize  this  is  not  the  kind  of  relationship  that  we  usually  aspire  to  have  with  our  food .PERIOD we  want  to  eat ,COMMA not  be  eaten  by ,COMMA our  food .PERIOD but  as  i  watch  the  mushrooms  grow  and  digest  my  body ,COMMA i  imagine  the  infinity  mushroom  as  a  symbol  of  a  new  way  of  thinking  about  death  and  the  relationship  between  my  body  and  the  environment .PERIOD see  for  me ,COMMA cultivating  the  infinity  mushroom  is  more  than  just  scientific  experimentation  or  gardening  or  raising  a  pet ,COMMA it  's  a  step  towards  accepting  the  fact  that  someday  i  will  die  and  decay .PERIOD it  's  also  a  step  towards  taking  responsibility  for  my  own  burden  on  the  planet .PERIOD growing  a  mushroom  is  also  part  of  a  larger  practice  of  cultivating  decomposing  organisms  called  decompiculture ,COMMA a  concept  that  was  developed  by  an  entomologist ,COMMA timothy  myles .PERIOD the  infinity  mushroom  is  a  subset  of  decompiculture  i  'm  calling  body  decompiculture  and  toxin  remediation ,COMMA the  cultivation  of  organisms  that  decompose  and  clean  toxins  in  bodies .PERIOD and  now  about  these  ninja  pajamas .PERIOD once  it  's  completed ,COMMA i  plan  to  integrate  the  infinity  mushrooms  into  a  number  of  objects .PERIOD first ,COMMA a  burial  suit  infused  with  mushroom  spores ,COMMA the  mushroom  death  suit .PERIOD i  'm  wearing  the  second  prototype  of  this  burial  suit .PERIOD it  's  covered  with  a  crocheted  netting  that  is  embedded  with  mushroom  spores .PERIOD the  dendritic  pattern  you  see  mimics  the  growth  of  mushroom  mycelia ,COMMA which  are  the  equivalent  of  plant  roots .PERIOD i  'm  also  making  a  decompiculture  kit ,COMMA a  cocktail  of  capsules  that  contain  infinity  mushroom  spores  and  other  elements  that  speed  decomposition  and  toxin  remediation .PERIOD these  capsules  are  embedded  in  a  nutrient-rich  jelly ,COMMA a  kind  of  second  skin ,COMMA which  dissolves  quickly  and  becomes  baby  food  for  the  growing  mushrooms .PERIOD so  i  plan  to  finish  the  mushroom  and  decompiculture  kit  in  the  next  year  or  two ,COMMA and  then  i'd  like  to  begin  testing  them ,COMMA first  with  expired  meat  from  the  market  and  then  with  human  subjects .PERIOD and  believe  it  or  not ,COMMA a  few  people  have  offered  to  donate  their  bodies  to  the  project  to  be  eaten  by  mushrooms .PERIOD what  i've  learned  from  talking  to  these  folks  is  that  we  share  a  common  desire  to  understand  and  accept  death  and  to  minimize  the  impact  of  our  death  on  the  environment .PERIOD i  wanted  to  cultivate  this  perspective  just  like  the  mushrooms ,COMMA so  i  formed  the  decompiculture  society ,COMMA a  group  of  people  called  decompinauts  who  actively  explore  their  postmortem  options ,COMMA seek  death  acceptance  and  cultivate  decomposing  organisms  like  the  infinity  mushroom .PERIOD the  decompiculture  society  shares  a  vision  of  a  cultural  shift ,COMMA from  our  current  culture  of  death  denial  and  body  preservation  to  one  of  decompiculture ,COMMA a  radical  acceptance  of  death  and  decomposition .PERIOD accepting  death  means  accepting  that  we  are  physical  beings  who  are  intimately  connected  to  the  environment ,COMMA as  the  research  on  environmental  toxins  confirms .PERIOD and  the  saying  goes ,COMMA we  came  from  dust  and  will  return  to  dust .PERIOD and  once  we  understand  that  we  're  connected  to  the  environment ,COMMA we  see  that  the  survival  of  our  species  depends  on  the  survival  of  the  planet .PERIOD i  believe  this  is  the  beginning  of  true  environmental  responsibility .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD let  's  talk  about  billions .PERIOD let  's  talk  about  past  and  future  billions .PERIOD we  know  that  about  106  billion  people  have  ever  lived .PERIOD and  we  know  that  most  of  them  are  dead .PERIOD and  we  also  know  that  most  of  them  live  or  lived  in  asia .PERIOD and  we  also  know  that  most  of  them  were  or  are  very  poor ,COMMA did  not  live  for  very  long .PERIOD let  's  talk  about  billions .PERIOD the  195,000  billion  dollars  of  wealth  in  the  world  today .PERIOD we  know  that  most  of  that  wealth  was  made  after  the  year  1800 .PERIOD and  we  know  that  most  of  it  is  currently  owned  by  people  we  might  call  westerners ,COMMA europeans ,COMMA north  americans ,COMMA australasians .PERIOD 19  percent  of  the  world  's  population  today ,COMMA westerners  own  two-thirds  of  its  wealth .PERIOD economic  historians  call  this  the  great  divergence .PERIOD and  this  slide  here  is  the  best  simplification  of  the  great  divergence  story  i  can  offer  you .PERIOD it  's  basically  two  ratios  of  per  capita  gdp ,COMMA per  capita  gross  domestic  product ,COMMA so  average  income .PERIOD one ,COMMA the  red  line ,COMMA is  the  ratio  of  british  to  indian  per  capita  income .PERIOD and  the  blue  line  is  the  ratio  of  american  to  chinese .PERIOD and  this  chart  goes  back  to  1500 .PERIOD and  you  can  see  here  that  there  's  an  exponential  great  divergence .PERIOD they  start  off  pretty  close  together .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA in  1500 ,COMMA the  average  chinese  was  richer  than  the  average  north  american .PERIOD when  you  get  to  the  1970s ,COMMA which  is  where  this  chart  ends ,COMMA the  average  briton  is  more  than  10  times  richer  than  the  average  indian .PERIOD and  that  's  allowing  for  differences  in  the  cost  of  living .PERIOD it  's  based  on  purchasing  power  parity .PERIOD the  average  american  is  nearly  20  times  richer  than  the  average  chinese  by  the  1970s .PERIOD so  why ?QUESTIONMARK this  was  n't  just  an  economic  story .PERIOD if  you  take  the  10  countries  that  went  on  to  become  the  western  empires ,COMMA in  1500  they  were  really  quite  tiny ,COMMA five  percent  of  the  world  's  land  surface ,COMMA 16  percent  of  its  population ,COMMA maybe  20  percent  of  its  income .PERIOD by  1913 ,COMMA these  10  countries ,COMMA plus  the  united  states ,COMMA controlled  vast  global  empires ,COMMA 58  percent  of  the  world  's  territory .PERIOD about  the  same  percentage  of  its  population ,COMMA and  a  really  huge ,COMMA nearly  three-quarters  share  of  global  economic  output .PERIOD and  notice ,COMMA most  of  that  went  to  the  motherland ,COMMA to  the  imperial  metropoles ,COMMA not  to  their  colonial  possessions .PERIOD now  you  cannot  just  blame  this  on  imperialism ,COMMA though  many  people  have  tried  to  do  so ,COMMA for  two  reasons .PERIOD one ,COMMA empire  was  the  least  original  thing  that  the  west  did  after  1500 .PERIOD everybody  did  empire .PERIOD they  beat  preexisting  oriental  empires  like  the  mughals  and  the  ottomans .PERIOD so  it  really  does  n't  look  like  empire  is  a  great  explanation  for  the  great  divergence .PERIOD in  any  case ,COMMA as  you  may  remember ,COMMA the  great  divergence  reaches  its  zenith  in  the  1970s ,COMMA some  considerable  time  after  decolonization .PERIOD this  is  not  a  new  question .PERIOD samuel  johnson ,COMMA the  great  lexicographer ,COMMA posed  it  through  his  character  rasselas  in  his  novel  rasselas ,COMMA prince  of  abissinia ,COMMA published  in  1759 .PERIOD by  what  means  are  the  europeans  thus  powerful .PERIOD or  why ,COMMA since  they  can  so  easily  visit  asia  and  africa  for  trade  or  conquest ,COMMA cannot  the  asiaticks  and  africans  invade  their  coasts ,COMMA plant  colonies  in  their  ports ,COMMA and  give  laws  to  their  natural  princes ?QUESTIONMARK the  same  wind  that  carries  them  back  would  bring  us  thither ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  a  great  question .PERIOD and  you  know  what ,COMMA it  was  also  being  asked  at  roughly  the  same  time  by  the  resterners ,COMMA by  the  people  in  the  rest  of  the  world ,COMMA like  ibrahim  muteferrika ,COMMA an  ottoman  official ,COMMA the  man  who  introduced  printing ,COMMA very  belatedly ,COMMA to  the  ottoman  empire ,COMMA who  said  in  a  book  published  in  1731 ,COMMA why  do  christian  nations  which  were  so  weak  in  the  past  compared  with  muslim  nations  begin  to  dominate  so  many  lands  in  modern  times  and  even  defeat  the  once  victorious  ottoman  armies ?QUESTIONMARK unlike  rasselas ,COMMA muteferrika  had  an  answer  to  that  question ,COMMA which  was  correct .PERIOD he  said  it  was  because  they  have  laws  and  rules  invented  by  reason .PERIOD it  's  not  geography .PERIOD you  may  think  we  can  explain  the  great  divergence  in  terms  of  geography .PERIOD we  know  that  's  wrong ,COMMA because  we  conducted  two  great  natural  experiments  in  the  20th  century  to  see  if  geography  mattered  more  than  institutions .PERIOD we  took  all  the  germans ,COMMA we  divided  them  roughly  in  two ,COMMA and  we  gave  the  ones  in  the  east  communism ,COMMA and  you  see  the  result .PERIOD within  an  incredibly  short  period  of  time ,COMMA people  living  in  the  german  democratic  republic .PERIOD produced  trabants ,COMMA the  trabbi ,COMMA one  of  the  world  's  worst  ever  cars ,COMMA while  people  in  the  west  produced  the  mercedes  benz .PERIOD if  you  still  do  n't  believe  me ,COMMA we  conducted  the  experiment  also  in  the  korean  peninsula .PERIOD and  we  decided  we'd  take  koreans  in  roughly  the  same  geographical  place  with ,COMMA notice ,COMMA the  same  basic  traditional  culture ,COMMA and  we  divided  them  in  two ,COMMA and  we  gave  the  northerners  communism .PERIOD and  the  result  is  an  even  bigger  divergence  in  a  very  short  space  of  time  than  happened  in  germany .PERIOD not  a  big  divergence  in  terms  of  uniform  design  for  border  guards  admittedly ,COMMA but  in  almost  every  other  respect ,COMMA it  's  a  huge  divergence .PERIOD which  leads  me  to  think  that  neither  geography  nor  national  character ,COMMA popular  explanations  for  this  kind  of  thing ,COMMA are  really  significant .PERIOD it  's  the  ideas .PERIOD it  's  the  institutions .PERIOD this  must  be  true  because  a  scotsman  said  it .PERIOD and  i  think  i  'm  the  only  scotsman  here  at  the  edinburgh  ted .PERIOD so  let  me  just  explain  to  you  that  the  smartest  man  ever  was  a  scotsman .PERIOD he  was  adam  smith ,COMMA not  billy  connolly ,COMMA not  sean  connery ,COMMA though  he  is  very  smart  indeed .PERIOD smith ,COMMA and  i  want  you  to  go  and  bow  down  before  his  statue  in  the  royal  mile .PERIOD it  's  a  wonderful  statue ,COMMA smith ,COMMA in  the  wealth  of  nations  published  in  1776 ,COMMA that  's  the  most  important  thing  that  happened  that  year .PERIOD you  bet .PERIOD there  was  a  little  local  difficulty  in  some  of  our  minor  colonies ,COMMA but .PERIOD china  seems  to  have  been  long  stationary ,COMMA and  probably  long  ago  acquired  that  full  complement  of  riches  which  is  consistent  with  the  nature  of  its  laws  and  institutions .PERIOD but  this  complement  may  be  much  inferior  to  what ,COMMA with  other  laws  and  institutions ,COMMA the  nature  of  its  soil ,COMMA climate ,COMMA and  situation  might  admit  of .PERIOD that  is  so  right  and  so  cool .PERIOD and  he  said  it  such  a  long  time  ago .PERIOD but  you  know ,COMMA this  is  a  ted  audience ,COMMA and  if  i  keep  talking  about  institutions ,COMMA you  're  going  to  turn  off .PERIOD so  i  'm  going  to  translate  this  into  language  that  you  can  understand .PERIOD let  's  call  them  the  killer  apps .PERIOD i  want  to  explain  to  you  that  there  were  six  killer  apps  that  set  the  west  apart  from  the  rest .PERIOD and  they  're  kind  of  like  the  apps  on  your  phone ,COMMA in  the  sense  that  they  look  quite  simple .PERIOD they  're  just  icons .PERIOD you  click  on  them .PERIOD but  behind  the  icon ,COMMA there  's  complex  code .PERIOD it  's  the  same  with  institutions .PERIOD there  are  six  which  i  think  explain  the  great  divergence .PERIOD one ,COMMA competition .PERIOD two ,COMMA the  scientific  revolution .PERIOD three ,COMMA property  rights .PERIOD four ,COMMA modern  medicine .PERIOD five ,COMMA the  consumer  society .PERIOD and  six ,COMMA the  work  ethic .PERIOD you  can  play  a  game  and  try  and  think  of  one  i've  missed  at ,COMMA or  try  and  boil  it  down  to  just  four ,COMMA but  you  'll  lose .PERIOD let  me  very  briefly  tell  you  what  i  mean  by  this ,COMMA synthesizing  the  work  of  many  economic  historians  in  the  process .PERIOD competition  means ,COMMA not  only  were  there  a  hundred  different  political  units  in  europe  in  1500 ,COMMA but  within  each  of  these  units ,COMMA there  was  competition  between  corporations  as  well  as  sovereigns .PERIOD the  ancestor  of  the  modern  corporation ,COMMA the  city  of  london  corporation ,COMMA existed  in  the  12th  century .PERIOD nothing  like  this  existed  in  china ,COMMA where  there  was  one  monolithic  state  covering  a  fifth  of  humanity ,COMMA and  anyone  with  any  ambition  had  to  pass  one  standardized  examination ,COMMA which  took  three  days  and  was  very  difficult  and  involved  memorizing  vast  numbers  of  characters  and  very  complex  confucian  essay  writing .PERIOD the  scientific  revolution  was  different  from  the  science  that  had  been  achieved  in  the  oriental  world  in  a  number  of  crucial  ways ,COMMA the  most  important  being  that ,COMMA through  the  experimental  method ,COMMA it  gave  men  control  over  nature  in  a  way  that  had  not  been  possible  before .PERIOD example ,COMMA benjamin  robins  's  extraordinary  application  of  newtonian  physics  to  ballistics .PERIOD once  you  do  that ,COMMA your  artillery  becomes  accurate .PERIOD think  of  what  that  means .PERIOD that  really  was  a  killer  application .PERIOD meanwhile ,COMMA there  's  no  scientific  revolution  anywhere  else .PERIOD the  ottoman  empire  's  not  that  far  from  europe ,COMMA but  there  's  no  scientific  revolution  there .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA they  demolish  taqi  al-din  's  observatory ,COMMA because  it  's  considered  blasphemous  to  inquire  into  the  mind  of  god .PERIOD property  rights ,COMMA it  's  not  the  democracy ,COMMA folks .PERIOD it  's  having  the  rule  of  law  based  on  private  property  rights .PERIOD that  's  what  makes  the  difference  between  north  america  and  south  america .PERIOD you  could  turn  up  in  north  america  having  signed  a  deed  of  indenture  saying ,COMMA i  'll  work  for  nothing  for  five  years .PERIOD you  just  have  to  feed  me .PERIOD but  at  the  end  of  it ,COMMA you've  got  a  hundred  acres  of  land .PERIOD that  's  the  land  grant  on  the  bottom  half  of  the  slide .PERIOD that  's  not  possible  in  latin  america  where  land  is  held  onto  by  a  tiny  elite  descended  from  the  conquistadors .PERIOD and  you  can  see  here  the  huge  divergence  that  happens  in  property  ownership  between  north  and  south .PERIOD most  people  in  rural  north  america  owned  some  land  by  1900 .PERIOD hardly  anyone  in  south  america  did .PERIOD that  's  another  killer  app .PERIOD modern  medicine  in  the  late  19th  century  began  to  make  major  breakthroughs  against  the  infectious  diseases  that  killed  a  lot  of  people .PERIOD and  this  was  another  killer  app ,COMMA the  very  opposite  of  a  killer ,COMMA because  it  doubled ,COMMA and  then  more  than  doubled ,COMMA human  life  expectancy .PERIOD it  even  did  that  in  the  european  empires .PERIOD even  in  places  like  senegal ,COMMA beginning  in  the  early  20th  century ,COMMA there  were  major  breakthroughs  in  public  health ,COMMA and  life  expectancy  began  to  rise .PERIOD it  does  n't  rise  any  faster  after  these  countries  become  independent .PERIOD the  empires  were  n't  all  bad .PERIOD the  consumer  society  is  what  you  need  for  the  industrial  revolution  to  have  a  point .PERIOD you  need  people  to  want  to  wear  tons  of  clothes .PERIOD you've  all  bought  an  article  of  clothing  in  the  last  month .PERIOD i  guarantee  it .PERIOD that  's  the  consumer  society .PERIOD and  it  propels  economic  growth  more  than  even  technological  change  itself .PERIOD japan  was  the  first  non-western  society  to  embrace  it .PERIOD the  alternative ,COMMA which  was  proposed  by  mahatma  gandhi ,COMMA was  to  institutionalize  and  make  poverty  permanent .PERIOD very  few  indians  today  wish  that  india  had  gone  down  mahatma  gandhi  's  road .PERIOD finally ,COMMA the  work  ethic .PERIOD max  weber  thought  that  was  peculiarly  protestant .PERIOD he  was  wrong .PERIOD any  culture  can  get  the  work  ethic  if  the  institutions  are  there  to  create  the  incentive  to  work .PERIOD we  know  this  because  today  the  work  ethic  is  no  longer  a  protestant ,COMMA western  phenomenon .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA the  west  has  lost  its  work  ethic .PERIOD today ,COMMA the  average  korean  works  a  thousand  hours  more  a  year  than  the  average  german ,COMMA a  thousand .PERIOD and  this  is  part  of  a  really  extraordinary  phenomenon ,COMMA and  that  is  the  end  of  the  great  divergence .PERIOD who  's  got  the  work  ethic  now ?QUESTIONMARK take  a  look  at  mathematical  attainment  by  15  year-olds .PERIOD at  the  top  of  the  international  league  table  according  to  the  latest  pisa  study ,COMMA is  the  shanghai  district  of  china .PERIOD the  gap  between  shanghai  and  the  united  kingdom  and  the  united  states  is  as  big  as  the  gap  between  the  uk .PERIOD and  the  us .PERIOD and  albania  and  tunisia .PERIOD you  probably  assume  that  because  the  iphone  was  designed  in  california  but  assembled  in  china  that  the  west  still  leads  in  terms  of  technological  innovation .PERIOD you  're  wrong .PERIOD in  terms  of  patents ,COMMA there  's  no  question  that  the  east  is  ahead .PERIOD not  only  has  japan  been  ahead  for  some  time ,COMMA south  korea  has  gone  into  third  place ,COMMA and  china  is  just  about  to  overtake  germany .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK because  the  killer  apps  can  be  downloaded .PERIOD it  's  open  source .PERIOD any  society  can  adopt  these  institutions ,COMMA and  when  they  do ,COMMA they  achieve  what  the  west  achieved  after  1500 ,COMMA only  faster .PERIOD this  is  the  great  reconvergence ,COMMA and  it  's  the  biggest  story  of  your  lifetime .PERIOD because  it  's  on  your  watch  that  this  is  happening .PERIOD it  's  our  generation  that  is  witnessing  the  end  of  western  predominance .PERIOD the  average  american  used  to  be  more  than  20  times  richer  than  the  average  chinese .PERIOD now  it  's  just  five  times ,COMMA and  soon  it  will  be  25  times .PERIOD so  i  want  to  end  with  three  questions  for  the  future  billions ,COMMA just  ahead  of  2016 ,COMMA when  the  united  states  will  lose  its  place  as  number  one  economy  to  china .PERIOD the  first  is ,COMMA can  you  delete  these  apps ,COMMA and  are  we  in  the  process  of  doing  so  in  the  western  world ?QUESTIONMARK the  second  question  is ,COMMA does  the  sequencing  of  the  download  matter ?QUESTIONMARK and  could  africa  get  that  sequencing  wrong ?QUESTIONMARK one  obvious  implication  of  modern  economic  history  is  that  it  's  quite  hard  to  transition  to  democracy  before  you've  established  secure  private  property  rights .PERIOD warning ,COMMA that  may  not  work .PERIOD and  third ,COMMA can  china  do  without  killer  app  number  three ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  the  one  that  john  locke  systematized  when  he  said  that  freedom  was  rooted  in  private  property  rights  and  the  protection  of  law .PERIOD that  's  the  basis  for  the  western  model  of  representative  government .PERIOD now  this  picture  shows  the  demolition  of  the  chinese  artist  ai  weiwei  's  studio  in  shanghai  earlier  this  year .PERIOD he  's  now  free  again ,COMMA having  been  detained ,COMMA as  you  know ,COMMA for  some  time .PERIOD but  i  do  n't  think  his  studio  has  been  rebuilt .PERIOD winston  churchill  once  defined  civilization  in  a  lecture  he  gave  in  the  fateful  year  of  1938 .PERIOD and  i  think  these  words  really  nail  it ,COMMA it  means  a  society  based  upon  the  opinion  of  civilians .PERIOD it  means  that  violence ,COMMA the  rule  of  warriors  and  despotic  chiefs ,COMMA the  conditions  of  camps  and  warfare ,COMMA of  riot  and  tyranny ,COMMA give  place  to  parliaments  where  laws  are  made ,COMMA and  independent  courts  of  justice  in  which  over  long  periods  those  laws  are  maintained .PERIOD that  is  civilization ,COMMA and  in  its  soil  grow  continually  freedom ,COMMA comfort  and  culture ,COMMA what  all  tedsters  care  about  most .PERIOD when  civilization  reigns  in  any  country ,COMMA a  wider  and  less  harassed  life  is  afforded  to  the  masses  of  the  people .PERIOD that  's  so  true .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  the  decline  of  western  civilization  is  inevitable ,COMMA because  i  do  n't  think  history  operates  in  this  kind  of  life-cycle  model ,COMMA beautifully  illustrated  by  thomas  cole  's  course  of  empire  paintings .PERIOD that  's  not  the  way  history  works .PERIOD that  's  not  the  way  the  west  rose ,COMMA and  i  do  n't  think  it  's  the  way  the  west  will  fall .PERIOD the  west  may  collapse  very  suddenly .PERIOD complex  civilizations  do  that ,COMMA because  they  operate ,COMMA most  of  the  time ,COMMA on  the  edge  of  chaos .PERIOD that  's  one  of  the  most  profound  insights  to  come  out  of  the  historical  study  of  complex  institutions  like  civilizations .PERIOD no ,COMMA we  may  hang  on ,COMMA despite  the  huge  burdens  of  debt  that  we've  accumulated ,COMMA despite  the  evidence  that  we've  lost  our  work  ethic  and  other  parts  of  our  historical  mojo .PERIOD but  one  thing  is  for  sure ,COMMA the  great  divergence  is  over ,COMMA folks .PERIOD thanks  very  much .PERIOD bruno  giussani ,COMMA niall ,COMMA i  am  just  curious  about  your  take  on  the  other  region  of  the  world  that  's  booming ,COMMA which  is  latin  america .PERIOD what  's  your  view  on  that ?QUESTIONMARK niall  ferguson ,COMMA well  i  really  am  not  just  talking  about  the  rise  of  the  east .PERIOD i  'm  talking  about  the  rise  of  the  rest ,COMMA and  that  includes  south  america .PERIOD i  once  asked  one  of  my  colleagues  at  harvard ,COMMA hey ,COMMA is  south  america  part  of  the  west ?QUESTIONMARK he  was  an  expert  in  latin  american  history .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA i  do  n't  know .PERIOD i  'll  have  to  think  about  that .PERIOD that  tells  you  something  really  important .PERIOD i  think  if  you  look  at  what  is  happening  in  brazil  in  particular ,COMMA but  also  chile ,COMMA which  was  in  many  ways  the  one  that  led  the  way  in  transforming  the  institutions  of  economic  life ,COMMA there  's  a  very  bright  future  indeed .PERIOD so  my  story  really  is  as  much  about  that  convergence  in  the  americas  as  it  's  a  convergence  story  in  eurasia .PERIOD bg ,COMMA and  there  is  this  impression  that  north  america  and  europe  are  not  really  paying  attention  to  these  trends .PERIOD mostly  they  're  worried  about  each  other .PERIOD the  americans  think  that  the  european  model  is  going  to  crumble  tomorrow .PERIOD the  europeans  think  that  the  american  budget  is  going  to  explode  tomorrow .PERIOD and  that  's  all  we  seem  to  be  caring  about  recently .PERIOD nf ,COMMA i  think  the  fiscal  crisis  that  we  see  in  the  developed  world  right  now ,COMMA both  sides  of  the  atlantic ,COMMA is  essentially  the  same  thing  taking  different  forms  in  terms  of  political  culture .PERIOD and  it  's  a  crisis  that  has  its  structural  facet ,COMMA it  's  partly  to  do  with  demographics .PERIOD but  it  's  also ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA to  do  with  the  massive  crisis  that  followed  excessive  leverage ,COMMA excessive  borrowing  in  the  private  sector .PERIOD that  crisis ,COMMA which  has  been  the  focus  of  so  much  attention ,COMMA including  by  me ,COMMA i  think  is  an  epiphenomenon .PERIOD the  financial  crisis  is  really  a  relatively  small  historic  phenomenon ,COMMA which  has  just  accelerated  this  huge  shift ,COMMA which  ends  half  a  millennium  of  western  ascendancy .PERIOD i  think  that  's  its  real  importance .PERIOD bg ,COMMA niall ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD what  technology  can  we  really  apply  to  reducing  global  poverty ?QUESTIONMARK and  what  i  found  was  quite  surprising .PERIOD we  started  looking  at  things  like  death  rates  in  the  20th  century ,COMMA and  how  they'd  been  improved ,COMMA and  very  simple  things  turned  out .PERIOD you'd  think  maybe  antibiotics  made  more  difference  than  clean  water ,COMMA but  it  's  actually  the  opposite .PERIOD and  so  very  simple  things ,COMMA off-the-shelf  technologies  that  we  could  easily  find  on  the  then-early  web ,COMMA would  clearly  make  a  huge  difference  to  that  problem .PERIOD but  i  also ,COMMA in  looking  at  more  powerful  technologies  and  nanotechnology  and  genetic  engineering  and  other  new  emerging  kind  of  digital  technologies ,COMMA became  very  concerned  about  the  potential  for  abuse .PERIOD if  you  think  about  it ,COMMA in  history ,COMMA a  long ,COMMA long  time  ago  we  dealt  with  the  problem  of  an  individual  abusing  another  individual .PERIOD we  came  up  with  something ,COMMA the  ten  commandments ,COMMA thou  shalt  not  kill .PERIOD that  's  a ,COMMA kind  of  a  one-on-one  thing .PERIOD we  organized  into  cities .PERIOD we  had  many  people .PERIOD and  to  keep  the  many  from  tyrannizing  the  one ,COMMA we  came  up  with  concepts  like  individual  liberty .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA to  have  to  deal  with  large  groups ,COMMA say ,COMMA at  the  nation-state  level ,COMMA and  we  had  to  have  mutual  non-aggression ,COMMA or  through  a  series  of  conflicts ,COMMA we  eventually  came  to  a  rough  international  bargain  to  largely  keep  the  peace .PERIOD but  now  we  have  a  new  situation ,COMMA really  what  people  call  an  asymmetric  situation ,COMMA where  technology  is  so  powerful  that  it  extends  beyond  a  nation-state .PERIOD it  's  not  the  nation-states  that  have  potential  access  to  mass  destruction ,COMMA but  individuals .PERIOD and  this  is  a  consequence  of  the  fact  that  these  new  technologies  tend  to  be  digital .PERIOD we  saw  genome  sequences .PERIOD you  can  download  the  gene  sequences  of  pathogens  off  the  internet  if  you  want  to ,COMMA and  clearly  someone  recently ,COMMA i  saw  in  a  science  magazine ,COMMA they  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA the  1918  flu  is  too  dangerous  to  fedex  around .PERIOD if  people  want  to  use  it  in  their  labs  for  working  on  research ,COMMA just  reconstruct  it  yourself ,COMMA because ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA it  might  break  in  fedex .PERIOD so  that  this  is  possible  to  do  this  is  not  deniable .PERIOD so  individuals  in  small  groups  super-empowered  by  access  to  these  kinds  of  self-replicating  technologies ,COMMA whether  it  be  biological  or  other ,COMMA are  clearly  a  danger  in  our  world .PERIOD and  the  danger  is  that  they  can  cause  roughly  what  's  a  pandemic .PERIOD and  we  really  do  n't  have  experience  with  pandemics .PERIOD and  we  're  also  not  very  good  as  a  society  at  acting  to  things  we  do  n't  have  direct  and  sort  of  gut-level  experience  with .PERIOD so  it  's  not  in  our  nature  to  pre-act .PERIOD and  in  this  case ,COMMA piling  on  more  technology  does  n't  solve  the  problem ,COMMA because  it  only  super-empowers  people  more .PERIOD so  the  solution  has  to  be ,COMMA as  people  like  russell  and  einstein  and  others  imagine  in  a  conversation  that  existed  in  a  much  stronger  form ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA early  in  the  20th  century ,COMMA that  the  solution  had  to  be  not  just  the  head  but  the  heart .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA public  policy  and  moral  progress .PERIOD the  bargain  that  gives  us  civilization  is  a  bargain  to  not  use  power .PERIOD we  get  our  individual  rights  by  society  protecting  us  from  others  not  doing  everything  they  can  do  but  largely  doing  only  what  is  legal .PERIOD and  so  to  limit  the  danger  of  these  new  things ,COMMA we  have  to  limit ,COMMA ultimately ,COMMA the  ability  of  individuals  to  have  access ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA to  pandemic  power .PERIOD we  also  have  to  have  sensible  defense ,COMMA because  no  limitation  is  going  to  prevent  a  crazy  person  from  doing  something .PERIOD and  you  know ,COMMA and  the  troubling  thing  is  that  it  's  much  easier  to  do  something  bad  than  to  defend  against  all  possible  bad  things ,COMMA so  the  offensive  uses  really  have  an  asymmetric  advantage .PERIOD so  these  are  the  kind  of  thoughts  i  was  thinking  in  1999  and  2000 ,COMMA and  my  friends  told  me  i  was  getting  really  depressed ,COMMA and  they  were  really  worried  about  me .PERIOD and  then  i  signed  a  book  contract  to  write  more  gloomy  thoughts  about  this  and  moved  into  a  hotel  room  in  new  york  with  one  room  full  of  books  on  the  plague ,COMMA and  you  know ,COMMA nuclear  bombs  exploding  in  new  york  where  i  would  be  within  the  circle ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD and  then  i  was  there  on  september  11th ,COMMA and  i  stood  in  the  streets  with  everyone .PERIOD and  it  was  quite  an  experience  to  be  there .PERIOD i  got  up  the  next  morning  and  walked  out  of  the  city ,COMMA and  all  the  sanitation  trucks  were  parked  on  houston  street  and  ready  to  go  down  and  start  taking  the  rubble  away .PERIOD and  i  walked  down  the  middle ,COMMA up  to  the  train  station ,COMMA and  everything  below  14th  street  was  closed .PERIOD it  was  quite  a  compelling  experience ,COMMA but  not  really ,COMMA i  suppose ,COMMA a  surprise  to  someone  who'd  had  his  room  full  of  the  books .PERIOD it  was  always  a  surprise  that  it  happened  then  and  there ,COMMA but  it  was  n't  a  surprise  that  it  happened  at  all .PERIOD and  everyone  then  started  writing  about  this .PERIOD thousands  of  people  started  writing  about  this .PERIOD and  i  eventually  abandoned  the  book ,COMMA and  then  chris  called  me  to  talk  at  the  conference .PERIOD i  really  do  n't  talk  about  this  anymore  because ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA there  's  enough  frustrating  and  depressing  things  going  on .PERIOD but  i  agreed  to  come  and  say  a  few  things  about  this .PERIOD and  i  would  say  that  we  cannot  give  up  the  rule  of  law  to  fight  an  asymmetric  threat ,COMMA which  is  what  we  seem  to  be  doing  because  of  the  present ,COMMA the  people  that  are  in  power ,COMMA because  that  's  to  give  up  the  thing  that  makes  civilization .PERIOD and  we  cannot  fight  the  threat  in  the  kind  of  stupid  way  we  're  doing ,COMMA because  a  million-dollar  act  causes  a  billion  dollars  of  damage ,COMMA causes  a  trillion  dollar  response  which  is  largely  ineffective  and  arguably ,COMMA probably  almost  certainly ,COMMA has  made  the  problem  worse .PERIOD so  we  cannot  fight  the  thing  with  a  million-to-one  cost ,COMMA one-to-a-million  cost-benefit  ratio .PERIOD so  after  giving  up  on  the  book ,COMMA and  i  had  the  great  honor  to  be  able  to  join  kleiner  perkins  about  a  year  ago .PERIOD and  to  work  through  venture  capital  on  the  innovative  side ,COMMA and  to  try  to  find  some  innovations  that  could  address  what  i  saw  as  some  of  these  big  problems .PERIOD things  where ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA a  factor  of  10  difference  can  make  a  factor  of  1,000  difference  in  the  outcome .PERIOD i've  been  amazed  in  the  last  year  at  the  incredible  quality  and  excitement  of  the  innovations  that  have  come  across  my  desk .PERIOD it  's  overwhelming  at  times .PERIOD i  'm  very  thankful  for  google  and  wikipedia  so  i  can  understand  at  least  a  little  of  what  people  are  talking  about  who  come  through  the  doors .PERIOD but  i  wanted  to  share  with  you  three  areas  that  i  'm  particularly  excited  about  and  that  relate  to  the  problems  that  i  was  talking  about  in  the  wired  article .PERIOD the  first  is  this  whole  area  of  education ,COMMA and  it  really  relates  to  what  nicholas  was  talking  about  with  a  $100  computer .PERIOD and  that  is  to  say  that  there  's  a  lot  of  legs  left  in  moore  's  law .PERIOD the  most  advanced  transistors  today  are  at  65  nanometers ,COMMA and  we've  seen ,COMMA and  i've  had  the  pleasure  to  invest  in ,COMMA companies  that  give  me  great  confidence  that  we  'll  extend  moore  's  law  all  the  way  down  to  roughly  the  10  nanometer  scale .PERIOD another  factor  of ,COMMA say ,COMMA six  in  dimensional  reduction ,COMMA which  should  give  us  about  another  factor  of  100  in  raw  improvement  in  what  the  chips  can  do .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA to  put  that  in  practical  terms ,COMMA if  something  costs  about  1,000  dollars  today ,COMMA say ,COMMA the  best  personal  computer  you  can  buy ,COMMA that  might  be  its  cost ,COMMA i  think  we  can  have  that  in  2020  for  10  dollars .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA just  imagine  what  that  $100  computer  will  be  in  2020  as  a  tool  for  education .PERIOD i  think  the  challenge  for  us  is ,COMMA i  'm  very  certain  that  that  will  happen ,COMMA the  challenge  is ,COMMA will  we  develop  the  kind  of  educational  tools  and  things  with  the  net  to  let  us  take  advantage  of  that  device ?QUESTIONMARK i'd  argue  today  that  we  have  incredibly  powerful  computers ,COMMA but  we  do  n't  have  very  good  software  for  them .PERIOD and  it  's  only  in  retrospect ,COMMA after  the  better  software  comes  along ,COMMA and  you  take  it  and  you  run  it  on  a  ten-year-old  machine ,COMMA you  say ,COMMA god ,COMMA the  machine  was  that  fast ?QUESTIONMARK i  remember  when  they  took  the  apple  mac  interface  and  they  put  it  back  on  the  apple  ii .PERIOD the  apple  ii  was  perfectly  capable  of  running  that  kind  of  interface ,COMMA we  just  did  n't  know  how  to  do  it  at  the  time .PERIOD so  given  that  we  know  and  should  believe ,COMMA because  moore  's  law  's  been ,COMMA like ,COMMA a  constant ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA it  's  just  been  very  predictable  progress  over  the  last  40  years  or  whatever .PERIOD we  can  know  what  the  computers  are  going  to  be  like  in  2020 .PERIOD it  's  great  that  we  have  initiatives  to  say ,COMMA let  's  go  create  the  education  and  educate  people  in  the  world ,COMMA because  that  's  a  great  force  for  peace .PERIOD and  we  can  give  everyone  in  the  world  a  $100  computer  or  a  $10  computer  in  the  next  15  years .PERIOD the  second  area  that  i  'm  focusing  on  is  the  environmental  problem ,COMMA because  that  's  clearly  going  to  put  a  lot  of  pressure  on  this  world .PERIOD we  'll  hear  a  lot  more  about  that  from  al  gore  very  shortly .PERIOD the  thing  that  we  see  as  the  kind  of  moore  's  law  trend  that  's  driving  improvement  in  our  ability  to  address  the  environmental  problem  is  new  materials .PERIOD we  have  a  challenge ,COMMA because  the  urban  population  is  growing  in  this  century  from  two  billion  to  six  billion  in  a  very  short  amount  of  time .PERIOD people  are  moving  to  the  cities .PERIOD they  all  need  clean  water ,COMMA they  need  energy ,COMMA they  need  transportation ,COMMA and  we  want  them  to  develop  in  a  green  way .PERIOD we  're  reasonably  efficient  in  the  industrial  sectors .PERIOD we've  made  improvements  in  energy  and  resource  efficiency ,COMMA but  the  consumer  sector ,COMMA especially  in  america ,COMMA is  very  inefficient .PERIOD but  these  new  materials  bring  such  incredible  innovations  that  there  's  a  strong  basis  for  hope  that  these  things  will  be  so  profitable  that  they  can  be  brought  to  the  market .PERIOD and  i  want  to  give  you  a  specific  example  of  a  new  material  that  was  discovered  15  years  ago .PERIOD if  we  take  carbon  nanotubes ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA iijima  discovered  them  in  1991 ,COMMA they  just  have  incredible  properties .PERIOD and  these  are  the  kinds  of  things  we  're  going  to  discover  as  we  start  to  engineer  at  the  nano  scale .PERIOD their  strength ,COMMA they  're  almost  the  strongest  material ,COMMA tensile  strength  material  known .PERIOD they  're  very ,COMMA very  stiff .PERIOD they  stretch  very ,COMMA very  little .PERIOD in  two  dimensions ,COMMA if  you  make ,COMMA like ,COMMA a  fabric  out  of  them ,COMMA they  're  30  times  stronger  than  kevlar .PERIOD and  if  you  make  a  three-dimensional  structure ,COMMA like  a  buckyball ,COMMA they  have  all  sorts  of  incredible  properties .PERIOD if  you  shoot  a  particle  at  them  and  knock  a  hole  in  them ,COMMA they  repair  themselves .PERIOD they  go  zip  and  they  repair  the  hole  in  femtoseconds ,COMMA which  is  not ,COMMA is  really  quick .PERIOD if  you  shine  a  light  on  them ,COMMA they  produce  electricity .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA if  you  flash  them  with  a  camera  they  catch  on  fire .PERIOD if  you  put  electricity  on  them ,COMMA they  emit  light .PERIOD if  you  run  current  through  them ,COMMA you  can  run  1,000  times  more  current  through  one  of  these  than  through  a  piece  of  metal .PERIOD you  can  make  both  p-  and  n-type  semiconductors ,COMMA which  means  you  can  make  transistors  out  of  them .PERIOD they  conduct  heat  along  their  length  but  not  across ,COMMA well ,COMMA there  is  no  width ,COMMA but  not  in  the  other  direction  if  you  stack  them  up .PERIOD that  's  a  property  of  carbon  fiber  also .PERIOD if  you  put  particles  in  them ,COMMA and  they  go  shooting  out  the  tip ,COMMA they  're  like  miniature  linear  accelerators  or  electron  guns .PERIOD the  inside  of  the  nanotubes  is  so  small ,COMMA the  smallest  ones  are  07  nanometers ,COMMA that  it  's  basically  a  quantum  world .PERIOD it  's  a  strange  place  inside  a  nanotube .PERIOD and  so  we  begin  to  see ,COMMA and  we've  seen  business  plans  already ,COMMA where  the  kind  of  things  lisa  randall  's  talking  about  are  in  there .PERIOD i  had  one  business  plan  where  i  was  trying  to  learn  more  about  witten  's  cosmic  dimension  strings  to  try  to  understand  what  the  phenomenon  was  going  on  in  this  proposed  nanomaterial .PERIOD so  inside  of  a  nanotube ,COMMA we  're  really  at  the  limit  here .PERIOD so  what  we  see  is  with  these  and  other  new  materials  that  we  can  do  things  with  different  properties ,COMMA lighter ,COMMA stronger ,COMMA and  apply  these  new  materials  to  the  environmental  problems .PERIOD new  materials  that  can  make  water ,COMMA new  materials  that  can  make  fuel  cells  work  better ,COMMA new  materials  that  catalyze  chemical  reactions ,COMMA that  cut  pollution  and  so  on .PERIOD ethanol ,COMMA new  ways  of  making  ethanol .PERIOD new  ways  of  making  electric  transportation .PERIOD the  whole  green  dream ,COMMA because  it  can  be  profitable .PERIOD and  we've  dedicated ,COMMA we've  just  raised  a  new  fund ,COMMA we  dedicated  100  million  dollars  to  these  kinds  of  investments .PERIOD we  believe  that  genentech ,COMMA the  compaq ,COMMA the  lotus ,COMMA the  sun ,COMMA the  netscape ,COMMA the  amazon ,COMMA the  google  in  these  fields  are  yet  to  be  found ,COMMA because  this  materials  revolution  will  drive  these  things  forward .PERIOD the  third  area  that  we  're  working  on ,COMMA and  we  just  announced  last  week ,COMMA we  were  all  in  new  york .PERIOD we  raised  200  million  dollars  in  a  specialty  fund  to  work  on  a  pandemic  in  biodefense .PERIOD and  to  give  you  an  idea  of  the  last  fund  that  kleiner  raised  was  a  $400  million  fund ,COMMA so  this  for  us  is  a  very  substantial  fund .PERIOD and  what  we  did ,COMMA over  the  last  few  months ,COMMA well ,COMMA a  few  months  ago ,COMMA ray  kurzweil  and  i  wrote  an  op-ed  in  the  new  york  times  about  how  publishing  the  1918  genome  was  very  dangerous .PERIOD and  john  doerr  and  brook  and  others  got  concerned ,COMMA unclear ,COMMA and  we  started  looking  around  at  what  the  world  was  doing  about  being  prepared  for  a  pandemic .PERIOD and  we  saw  a  lot  of  gaps .PERIOD and  so  we  asked  ourselves ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA can  we  find  innovative  things  that  will  go  fill  these  gaps ?QUESTIONMARK and  brooks  told  me  in  a  break  here ,COMMA he  said  he  's  found  so  much  stuff  he  cannot  sleep .PERIOD because  there  's  so  many  great  technologies  out  there ,COMMA we  're  essentially  buried .PERIOD and  we  need  them ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD we  have  one  antiviral  that  people  are  talking  about  stockpiling  that  still  works ,COMMA roughly .PERIOD that  's  tamiflu .PERIOD but  tamiflu ,COMMA the  virus  is  resistant .PERIOD it  is  resistant  to  tamiflu .PERIOD we've  discovered  with  aids  we  need  cocktails  to  work  well  so  that  the  viral  resistance ,COMMA we  need  several  anti-virals .PERIOD we  need  better  surveillance .PERIOD we  need  networks  that  can  find  out  what  's  going  on .PERIOD we  need  rapid  diagnostics  so  that  we  can  tell  if  somebody  has  a  strain  of  flu  which  we  have  only  identified  very  recently .PERIOD we've  got  to  be  able  to  make  the  rapid  diagnostics  quickly .PERIOD we  need  new  anti-virals  and  cocktails .PERIOD we  need  new  kinds  of  vaccines .PERIOD vaccines  that  are  broad  spectrum .PERIOD vaccines  that  we  can  manufacture  quickly .PERIOD cocktails ,COMMA more  polyvalent  vaccines .PERIOD you  normally  get  a  trivalent  vaccine  against  three  possible  strains .PERIOD we  need ,COMMA we  do  n't  know  where  this  thing  is  going .PERIOD we  believe  that  if  we  could  fill  these  10  gaps ,COMMA we  have  a  chance  to  help  really  reduce  the  risk  of  a  pandemic .PERIOD and  the  difference  between  a  normal  flu  season  and  a  pandemic  is  about  a  factor  of  1,000  in  deaths  and  certainly  enormous  economic  impact .PERIOD so  we  're  very  excited  because  we  think  we  can  fund  10 ,COMMA or  speed  up  10  projects  and  see  them  come  to  market  in  the  next  couple  years  that  will  address  this .PERIOD so  if  we  can  address ,COMMA use  technology ,COMMA help  address  education ,COMMA help  address  the  environment ,COMMA help  address  the  pandemic ,COMMA does  that  solve  the  larger  problem  that  i  was  talking  about  in  the  wired  article ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  'm  afraid  the  answer  is  really  no .PERIOD because  you  cannot  solve  a  problem  with  the  management  of  technology  with  more  technology .PERIOD if  we  let  an  unlimited  amount  of  power  loose ,COMMA then  we  will ,COMMA a  very  small  number  of  people  will  be  able  to  abuse  it .PERIOD we  cannot  fight  at  a  million-to-one  disadvantage .PERIOD so  what  we  need  to  do  is ,COMMA we  need  better  policy .PERIOD and  for  example ,COMMA some  things  we  could  do  that  would  be  policy  solutions  which  are  not  really  in  the  political  air  right  now  but  perhaps  with  the  change  of  administration  would  be ,COMMA use  markets .PERIOD markets  are  a  very  strong  force .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA rather  than  trying  to  regulate  away  problems ,COMMA which  probably  wo  n't  work ,COMMA if  we  could  price  into  the  cost  of  doing  business ,COMMA the  cost  of  catastrophe ,COMMA so  that  people  who  are  doing  things  that  had  a  higher  cost  of  catastrophe  would  have  to  take  insurance  against  that  risk .PERIOD so  if  you  wanted  to  put  a  drug  on  the  market  you  could  put  it  on .PERIOD but  it  would  n't  have  to  be  approved  by  regulators .PERIOD you'd  have  to  convince  an  actuary  that  it  would  be  safe .PERIOD and  if  you  apply  the  notion  of  insurance  more  broadly ,COMMA you  can  use  a  more  powerful  force ,COMMA a  market  force ,COMMA to  provide  feedback .PERIOD how  could  you  keep  the  law ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  the  law  would  be  a  really  good  thing  to  keep .PERIOD well ,COMMA you  have  to  hold  people  accountable .PERIOD the  law  requires  accountability .PERIOD today  scientists ,COMMA technologists ,COMMA businessmen ,COMMA engineers  do  n't  have  any  personal  responsibility  for  the  consequences  of  their  actions .PERIOD so  if  you  tie  that ,COMMA you  have  to  tie  that  back  with  the  law .PERIOD and  finally ,COMMA i  think  we  have  to  do  something  that  's  not  really ,COMMA it  's  almost  unacceptable  to  say  this ,COMMA which ,COMMA we  have  to  begin  to  design  the  future .PERIOD we  cannot  pick  the  future ,COMMA but  we  can  steer  the  future .PERIOD our  investment  in  trying  to  prevent  pandemic  flu  is  affecting  the  distribution  of  possible  outcomes .PERIOD we  may  not  be  able  to  stop  it ,COMMA but  the  likelihood  that  it  will  get  past  us  is  lower  if  we  focus  on  that  problem .PERIOD so  we  can  design  the  future  if  we  choose  what  kind  of  things  we  want  to  have  happen  and  not  have  happen ,COMMA and  steer  us  to  a  lower-risk  place .PERIOD vice  president  gore  will  talk  about  how  we  could  steer  the  climate  trajectory  into  a  lower  probability  of  catastrophic  risk .PERIOD but  above  all ,COMMA what  we  have  to  do  is  we  have  to  help  the  good  guys ,COMMA the  people  on  the  defensive  side ,COMMA have  an  advantage  over  the  people  who  want  to  abuse  things .PERIOD and  what  we  have  to  do  to  do  that  is  we  have  to  limit  access  to  certain  information .PERIOD and  growing  up  as  we  have ,COMMA and  holding  very  high  the  value  of  free  speech ,COMMA this  is  a  hard  thing  for  us  to  accept ,COMMA for  all  of  us  to  accept .PERIOD it  's  especially  hard  for  the  scientists  to  accept  who  still  remember ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA galileo  essentially  locked  up ,COMMA and  who  are  still  fighting  this  battle  against  the  church .PERIOD but  that  's  the  price  of  having  a  civilization .PERIOD the  price  of  retaining  the  rule  of  law  is  to  limit  the  access  to  the  great  and  kind  of  unbridled  power .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD imagine  spending  seven  years  at  mit  and  research  laboratories ,COMMA only  to  find  out  that  you  're  a  performance  artist .PERIOD i  'm  also  a  software  engineer ,COMMA and  i  make  lots  of  different  kinds  of  art  with  the  computer .PERIOD and  i  think  the  main  thing  that  i  'm  interested  in  is  trying  to  find  a  way  of  making  the  computer  into  a  personal  mode  of  expression .PERIOD and  many  of  you  out  there  are  the  heads  of  macromedia  and  microsoft ,COMMA and  in  a  way  those  are  my  bane: .PERIOD i  think  there  's  a  great  homogenizing  force  that  software  imposes  on  people  and  limits  the  way  they  think  about  what  's  possible  on  the  computer .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA it  's  also  a  great  liberating  force  that  makes  possible ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA publishing  and  so  forth ,COMMA and  standards ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD but ,COMMA in  a  way ,COMMA the  computer  makes  possible  much  more  than  what  most  people  think ,COMMA and  my  art  has  just  been  about  trying  to  find  a  personal  way  of  using  the  computer ,COMMA and  so  i  end  up  writing  software  to  do  that .PERIOD chris  has  asked  me  to  do  a  short  performance ,COMMA and  so  i  'm  going  to  take  just  this  time ,COMMA maybe  10  minutes ,COMMA to  do  that ,COMMA and  hopefully  at  the  end  have  just  a  moment  to  show  you  a  couple  of  my  other  projects  in  video  form .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD we've  got  about  a  minute  left .PERIOD i'd  just  like  to  show  a  clip  from  a  most  recent  project .PERIOD i  did  a  performance  with  two  singers  who  specialize  in  making  strange  noises  with  their  mouths .PERIOD and  this  just  came  off  last  september  at  ars  electronica .PERIOD we  repeated  it  in  england .PERIOD and  the  idea  is  to  visualize  their  speech  and  song  behind  them  with  a  large  screen .PERIOD we  used  a  computer  vision  tracking  system  in  order  to  know  where  they  were .PERIOD and  since  we  know  where  their  heads  are ,COMMA and  we  have  a  wireless  mic  on  them  that  we  're  processing  the  sound  from ,COMMA we  're  able  to  create  visualizations  which  are  linked  very  tightly  to  what  they  're  doing  with  their  speech .PERIOD this  will  take  about  30  seconds  or  so .PERIOD he  's  making  a ,COMMA kind  of ,COMMA cheek-flapping  sound .PERIOD well ,COMMA suffice  it  to  say  it  's  not  all  like  that ,COMMA but  that  's  part  of  it .PERIOD thanks  very  much .PERIOD there  's  always  lots  more .PERIOD i  'm  overtime ,COMMA so  i  just  wanted  to  say  you  can ,COMMA if  you  're  in  new  york ,COMMA you  can  check  out  my  work  at  the  whitney  biennial  next  week ,COMMA and  also  at  bitforms  gallery  in  chelsea .PERIOD and  with  that ,COMMA i  think  i  should  give  up  the  stage .PERIOD so ,COMMA thank  you  so  much .PERIOD so  sometimes  i  get  invited  to  give  weird  talks .PERIOD i  got  invited  to  speak  to  the  people  who  dress  up  in  big  stuffed  animal  costumes  to  perform  at  sporting  events .PERIOD unfortunately  i  could  n't  go .PERIOD but  it  got  me  thinking  about  the  fact  that  these  guys ,COMMA at  least  most  of  them ,COMMA know  what  it  is  that  they  do  for  a  living .PERIOD what  they  do  is  they  dress  up  as  stuffed  animals  and  entertain  people  at  sporting  events .PERIOD shortly  after  that  i  got  invited  to  speak  at  the  convention  of  the  people  who  make  balloon  animals .PERIOD and  again ,COMMA i  could  n't  go .PERIOD but  it  's  a  fascinating  group .PERIOD they  make  balloon  animals .PERIOD there  is  a  big  schism  between  the  ones  who  make  gospel  animals  and  porn  animals ,COMMA but  -- .PERIOD they  do  a  lot  of  really  cool  stuff  with  balloons .PERIOD sometimes  they  get  in  trouble ,COMMA but  not  often .PERIOD and  the  other  thing  about  these  guys  is ,COMMA they  also  know  what  they  do  for  a  living .PERIOD they  make  balloon  animals .PERIOD but  what  do  we  do  for  a  living ?QUESTIONMARK what  exactly  to  the  people  watching  this  do  every  day ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  want  to  argue  that  what  we  do  is  we  try  to  change  everything .PERIOD that  we  try  to  find  a  piece  of  the  status  quo ,COMMA something  that  bothers  us ,COMMA something  that  needs  to  be  improved ,COMMA something  that  is  itching  to  be  changed ,COMMA and  we  change  it .PERIOD we  try  to  make  big ,COMMA permanent ,COMMA important  change .PERIOD but  we  do  n't  think  about  it  that  way .PERIOD and  we  have  n't  spent  a  lot  of  time  talking  about  what  that  process  is  like .PERIOD and  i've  been  studying  it  for  a  couple  years .PERIOD and  i  want  to  share  a  couple  stories  with  you  today .PERIOD first ,COMMA about  a  guy  named  nathan  winograd .PERIOD nathan  was  the  number  two  person  at  the  san  francisco  spca .PERIOD and  what  you  may  not  know  about  the  history  of  the  spca  is ,COMMA it  was  founded  to  kill  dogs  and  cats .PERIOD cities  gave  them  a  charter  to  get  rid  of  the  stray  animals  on  the  street  and  destroy  them .PERIOD in  a  typical  year  four  million  dogs  and  cats  were  killed ,COMMA most  of  them  within  24  hours  of  being  scooped  off  of  the  street .PERIOD nathan  and  his  boss  saw  this .PERIOD and  they  could  not  tolerate  it .PERIOD so  they  set  out  to  make  san  francisco  a  no-kill  city: .PERIOD create  an  entire  city  where  every  dog  and  cat ,COMMA unless  it  was  ill  or  dangerous ,COMMA would  be  adopted ,COMMA not  killed .PERIOD and  everyone  said  it  was  impossible .PERIOD nathan  and  his  boss  went  to  the  city  council  to  get  a  change  in  the  ordinance .PERIOD and  people  from  spcas  and  humane  shelters  around  the  country  flew  to  san  francisco  to  testify  against  them ,COMMA to  say  it  would  hurt  the  movement  and  it  was  inhumane .PERIOD they  persisted .PERIOD and  nathan  went  directly  to  the  community .PERIOD he  connected  with  people  who  cared  about  this: .PERIOD nonprofessionals ,COMMA people  with  passion .PERIOD and  within  just  a  couple  years ,COMMA san  francisco  became  the  first  no-kill  city .PERIOD running  no  deficit ,COMMA completely  supported  by  the  community .PERIOD nathan  left  and  went  to  tompkins  county ,COMMA new  york  -- .PERIOD a  place  as  different  from  san  francisco  as  you  can  be  and  still  be  in  the  united  states .PERIOD and  he  did  it  again .PERIOD he  went  from  being  a  glorified  dogcatcher  to  completely  transforming  the  community .PERIOD and  then  he  went  to  north  carolina  and  did  it  again .PERIOD and  he  went  to  reno  and  he  did  it  again .PERIOD and  when  i  think  about  what  nathan  did ,COMMA and  when  i  think  about  what  people  here  do ,COMMA i  think  about  ideas .PERIOD and  i  think  about  the  idea  that  creating  an  idea ,COMMA spreading  an  idea  has  a  lot  behind  it .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  if  you've  ever  been  to  a  jewish  wedding .PERIOD but  what  they  do  is ,COMMA they  take  a  light  bulb  and  they  smash  it .PERIOD now  there  is  a  bunch  of  reasons  for  that ,COMMA and  stories  about  it .PERIOD but  one  reason  is  because  it  indicates  a  change ,COMMA from  before  to  after .PERIOD it  is  a  moment  in  time .PERIOD and  i  want  to  argue  that  we  are  living  through  and  are  right  at  the  key  moment  of  a  change  in  the  way  ideas  are  created  and  spread  and  implemented .PERIOD we  started  with  the  factory  idea: .PERIOD that  you  could  change  the  whole  world  if  you  had  an  efficient  factory  that  could  churn  out  change .PERIOD we  then  went  to  the  tv  idea .PERIOD that  said  if  you  had  a  big  enough  mouthpiece ,COMMA if  you  could  get  on  tv  enough  times ,COMMA if  you  could  buy  enough  ads ,COMMA you  could  win .PERIOD and  now  we  're  in  this  new  model  of  leadership .PERIOD where  the  way  we  make  change  is  not  by  using  money  or  power  to  lever  a  system ,COMMA but  by  leading .PERIOD so  let  me  tell  you  about  the  three  cycles .PERIOD the  first  one  is  the  factory  cycle .PERIOD henry  ford  comes  up  with  a  really  cool  idea .PERIOD it  enables  him  to  hire  men  who  used  to  get  paid  50  cents  a  day  and  pay  them  five  dollars  a  day .PERIOD because  he  's  got  an  efficient  enough  factory .PERIOD well  with  that  sort  of  advantage  you  can  churn  out  a  lot  of  cars .PERIOD you  can  make  a  lot  of  change .PERIOD you  can  get  roads  built .PERIOD you  can  change  the  fabric  of  an  entire  country .PERIOD that  the  essence  of  what  you  're  doing  is  you  need  ever-cheaper  labor ,COMMA and  ever-faster  machines .PERIOD and  the  problem  we've  run  into  is ,COMMA we  're  running  out  of  both .PERIOD ever-cheaper  labor  and  ever-faster  machines .PERIOD so  we  shift  gears  for  a  minute ,COMMA and  say ,COMMA i  know ,COMMA television .PERIOD advertising .PERIOD push  push .PERIOD take  a  good  idea  and  push  it  on  the  world .PERIOD i  have  a  better  mousetrap .PERIOD and  if  i  can  just  get  enough  money  to  tell  enough  people ,COMMA i  'll  sell  enough .PERIOD and  you  can  build  an  entire  industry  on  that .PERIOD if  necessary  you  can  put  babies  in  your  ads .PERIOD if  necessary  you  can  use  babies  to  sell  other  stuff .PERIOD and  if  babies  do  n't  work ,COMMA you  can  use  doctors .PERIOD but  be  careful .PERIOD because  you  do  n't  want  to  get  an  unfortunate  juxtaposition ,COMMA where  you  're  talking  about  one  thing  instead  of  the  other .PERIOD this  model  requires  you  to  act  like  the  king ,COMMA like  the  person  in  the  front  of  the  room  throwing  things  to  the  peons  in  the  back .PERIOD that  you  are  in  charge ,COMMA and  you  're  going  to  tell  people  what  to  do  next .PERIOD the  quick  little  diagram  of  it  is ,COMMA you  're  up  here ,COMMA and  you  are  pushing  it  out  to  the  world .PERIOD this  method ,COMMA mass  marketing ,COMMA requires  average  ideas ,COMMA because  you  're  going  to  the  masses ,COMMA and  plenty  of  ads .PERIOD what  we've  done  as  spammers  is  tried  to  hypnotize  everyone  into  buying  our  idea .PERIOD hypnotize  everyone  into  donating  to  our  cause .PERIOD hypnotize  everyone  into  voting  for  our  candidate .PERIOD and ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA it  does  n't  work  so  well  anymore  either .PERIOD but  there  is  good  news  around  the  corner ,COMMA really  good  news .PERIOD i  call  it  the  idea  of  tribes .PERIOD what  tribes  are ,COMMA is  a  very  simple  concept  that  goes  back  50,000  years .PERIOD it  's  about  leading  and  connecting  people  and  ideas .PERIOD and  it  's  something  that  people  have  wanted  forever .PERIOD lots  of  people  are  used  to  having  a  spiritual  tribe ,COMMA or  a  church  tribe ,COMMA having  a  work  tribe ,COMMA having  a  community  tribe .PERIOD but  now ,COMMA thanks  to  the  internet ,COMMA thanks  to  the  explosion  of  mass  media ,COMMA thanks  to  a  lot  of  other  things  that  are  bubbling  through  our  society  around  the  world ,COMMA tribes  are  everywhere .PERIOD the  internet  was  supposed  to  homogenize  everyone  by  connecting  us  all .PERIOD instead  what  it  's  allowed  is  silos  of  interest .PERIOD so  you've  got  the  red-hat  ladies  over  here .PERIOD you've  got  the  red-hat  triathletes  over  there .PERIOD you've  got  the  organized  armies  over  here .PERIOD you've  got  the  disorganized  rebels  over  here .PERIOD you've  got  people  in  white  hats  making  food .PERIOD and  people  in  white  hats  sailing  boats .PERIOD the  point  is  that  you  can  find  ukrainian  folk  dancers  and  connect  with  them .PERIOD because  you  want  to  be  connected .PERIOD that  people  on  the  fringes  can  find  each  other ,COMMA connect  and  go  somewhere .PERIOD every  town  that  has  a  volunteer  fire  department  understands  this  way  of  thinking .PERIOD now  it  turns  out  this  is  a  legitimate  non-photoshopped  photo .PERIOD people  i  know  who  are  firemen  told  me  that  this  is  not  uncommon .PERIOD and  that  what  firemen  do  to  train  sometimes  is  they  take  a  house  that  is  going  to  be  torn  down ,COMMA and  they  burn  it  down  instead ,COMMA and  practice  putting  it  out .PERIOD but  they  always  stop  and  take  a  picture .PERIOD you  know  the  pirate  tribe  is  a  fascinating  one .PERIOD they've  got  their  own  flag .PERIOD they've  got  the  eye  patches .PERIOD you  can  tell  when  you  're  running  into  someone  in  a  tribe .PERIOD and  it  turns  out  that  it  's  tribes ,COMMA not  money ,COMMA not  factories ,COMMA that  can  change  our  world ,COMMA that  can  change  politics ,COMMA that  can  align  large  numbers  of  people .PERIOD not  because  you  force  them  to  do  something  against  their  will .PERIOD but  because  they  wanted  to  connect .PERIOD that  what  we  do  for  a  living  now ,COMMA all  of  us ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA is  find  something  worth  changing ,COMMA and  then  assemble  tribes  that  assemble  tribes  that  spread  the  idea  and  spread  the  idea .PERIOD and  it  becomes  something  far  bigger  than  ourselves .PERIOD it  becomes  a  movement .PERIOD so  when  al  gore  set  out  to  change  the  world  again ,COMMA he  did  n't  do  it  by  himself .PERIOD and  he  did  n't  do  it  by  buying  a  lot  of  ads .PERIOD he  did  it  by  creating  a  movement .PERIOD thousands  of  people  around  the  country  who  could  give  his  presentation  for  him .PERIOD because  he  cannot  be  in  100  or  200  or  500  cities  in  each  night .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  everyone .PERIOD what  kevin  kelley  has  taught  us  is  you  just  need ,COMMA i  do  n't  know ,COMMA a  thousand  true  fans  -- .PERIOD a  thousand  people  who  care  enough  that  they  will  get  you  the  next  round  and  the  next  round  and  the  next  round .PERIOD and  that  means  that  the  idea  you  create ,COMMA the  product  you  create ,COMMA the  movement  you  create  is  n't  for  everyone .PERIOD it  's  not  a  mass  thing .PERIOD that  's  not  what  this  is  about .PERIOD what  it  's  about  instead  is  finding  the  true  believers .PERIOD it  's  easy  to  look  at  what  i've  said  so  far ,COMMA and  say ,COMMA wait  a  minute ,COMMA i  do  n't  have  what  it  takes  to  be  that  kind  of  leader .PERIOD so  here  are  two  leaders .PERIOD they  do  n't  have  a  lot  in  common .PERIOD they  're  about  the  same  age .PERIOD but  that  's  about  it .PERIOD what  they  did ,COMMA though ,COMMA is  each  in  their  own  way ,COMMA created  a  different  way  of  navigating  your  way  through  technology .PERIOD so  some  people  will  go  out  and  get  people  to  be  on  one  team .PERIOD and  some  people  will  get  people  to  be  on  the  other  team .PERIOD it  also  informs  the  decisions  you  make  when  you  make  products  or  services .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA this  is  one  of  my  favorite  devices .PERIOD but  what  a  shame  that  it  's  not  organized  to  help  authors  create  movements .PERIOD what  would  happen  if ,COMMA when  you  're  using  your  kindle ,COMMA you  could  see  the  comments  and  quotes  and  notes  from  all  the  other  people  reading  the  same  book  as  you  in  that  moment .PERIOD or  from  your  book  group .PERIOD or  from  your  friends ,COMMA or  from  the  circle  you  want .PERIOD what  would  happen  if  authors ,COMMA or  people  with  ideas  could  use  version  two ,COMMA which  comes  out  on  monday ,COMMA and  use  it  to  organize  people  who  want  to  talk  about  something .PERIOD now  there  is  a  million  things  i  could  share  with  you  about  the  mechanics  here .PERIOD but  let  me  just  try  a  couple .PERIOD the  beatles  did  not  invent  teenagers .PERIOD they  merely  decided  to  lead  them .PERIOD that  most  movements ,COMMA most  leadership  that  we  're  doing  is  about  finding  a  group  that  's  disconnected  but  already  has  a  yearning  -- .PERIOD not  persuading  people  to  want  something  they  do  n't  have  yet .PERIOD when  diane  hatz  worked  on  the  meatrix ,COMMA her  video  that  spread  all  across  the  internet  about  the  way  farm  animals  are  treated ,COMMA she  did  n't  invent  the  idea  of  being  a  vegan .PERIOD she  did  n't  invent  the  idea  of  caring  about  this  issue .PERIOD but  she  helped  organize  people ,COMMA and  helped  turn  it  into  a  movement .PERIOD hugo  chavez  did  not  invent  the  disaffected  middle  and  lower  class  of  venezuela .PERIOD he  merely  led  them .PERIOD bob  marley  did  not  invent  rastafarians .PERIOD he  just  stepped  up  and  said ,COMMA follow  me .PERIOD derek  sivers  invented  cd  baby ,COMMA which  allowed  independent  musicians  to  have  a  place  to  sell  their  music  without  selling  out  to  the  man  -- .PERIOD to  have  place  to  take  the  mission  they  already  wanted  to  go  to ,COMMA and  connect  with  each  other .PERIOD what  all  these  people  have  in  common  is  that  they  are  heretics .PERIOD that  heretics  look  at  the  status  quo  and  say ,COMMA this  will  not  stand .PERIOD i  cannot  abide  this  status  quo .PERIOD i  am  willing  to  stand  up  and  be  counted  and  move  things  forward .PERIOD i  see  what  the  status  quo  is .PERIOD i  do  n't  like  it .PERIOD that  instead  of  looking  at  all  the  little  rules  and  following  each  one  of  them ,COMMA that  instead  of  being  what  i  call  a  sheepwalker ,COMMA somebody  who  's  half  asleep ,COMMA following  instructions ,COMMA keeping  their  head  down ,COMMA fitting  in ,COMMA every  once  in  a  while  someone  stands  up  and  says ,COMMA not  me .PERIOD someone  stands  up  and  says ,COMMA this  one  is  important .PERIOD we  need  to  organize  around  it .PERIOD and  not  everyone  will .PERIOD but  you  do  n't  need  everyone .PERIOD you  just  need  a  few  people ,COMMA who  will  look  at  the  rules ,COMMA realize  they  make  no  sense ,COMMA and  realize  how  much  they  want  to  be  connected .PERIOD so  tony  shea  does  not  run  a  shoe  store .PERIOD zappos  is  n't  a  shoe  store .PERIOD zappos  is  the  one ,COMMA the  only ,COMMA the  best-there-ever-was  place  for  people  who  are  into  shoes  to  find  each  other ,COMMA to  talk  about  their  passion ,COMMA to  connect  with  people  who  care  more  about  customer  service  than  making  a  nickel  tomorrow .PERIOD it  can  be  something  as  prosaic  as  shoes ,COMMA and  something  as  complicated  as  overthrowing  a  government .PERIOD it  's  exactly  the  same  behavior  though .PERIOD what  it  requires ,COMMA as  geraldine  carter  has  discovered ,COMMA is  to  be  able  to  say ,COMMA i  cannot  do  this  by  myself .PERIOD but  if  i  can  get  other  people  to  join  my  climb  and  ride ,COMMA then  together  we  can  get  something  that  we  all  want .PERIOD we  're  just  waiting  for  someone  to  lead  us .PERIOD michelle  kaufman  has  pioneered  new  ways  of  thinking  about  environmental  architecture .PERIOD she  does  n't  do  it  by  quietly  building  one  house  at  a  time .PERIOD she  does  it  by  telling  a  story  to  people  who  want  to  hear  it .PERIOD by  connecting  a  tribe  of  people  who  are  desperate  to  be  connected  to  each  other .PERIOD by  leading  a  movement  and .PERIOD making  change .PERIOD and  around  and  around  and  around  it  goes .PERIOD so  three  questions  i'd  offer  you .PERIOD the  first  one  is ,COMMA who  exactly  are  you  upsetting ?QUESTIONMARK because  if  you  're  not  upsetting  anyone ,COMMA you  're  not  changing  the  status  quo .PERIOD the  second  question  is ,COMMA who  are  you  connecting ?QUESTIONMARK because  for  a  lot  of  people ,COMMA that  's  what  they  're  in  it  for: .PERIOD the  connections  that  are  being  made ,COMMA one  to  the  other .PERIOD and  the  third  one  is ,COMMA who  are  you  leading ?QUESTIONMARK because  focusing  on  that  part  of  it ,COMMA not  the  mechanics  of  what  you  're  building ,COMMA but  the  who ,COMMA and  the  leading  part ,COMMA is  where  change  comes .PERIOD so  blake ,COMMA at  tom  's  shoes ,COMMA had  a  very  simple  idea .PERIOD what  would  happen  if  every  time  someone  bought  a  pair  of  these  shoes  i  gave  exactly  the  same  pair  to  someone  who  does  n't  even  own  a  pair  of  shoes ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  not  the  story  of  how  you  get  shelf  space  at  neiman  marcus .PERIOD it  's  a  story  of  a  product  that  tells  a  story .PERIOD and  as  you  walk  around  with  this  remarkable  pair  of  shoes  and  someone  says ,COMMA what  are  those ?QUESTIONMARK you  get  to  tell  the  story  on  blake  's  behalf ,COMMA on  behalf  of  the  people  who  got  the  shoes .PERIOD and  suddenly  it  's  not  one  pair  of  shoes  or  100  pairs  of  shoes .PERIOD it  's  tens  of  thousands  of  pairs  of  shoes .PERIOD my  friend  red  maxwell  has  spent  the  last  10  years  fighting  against  juvenile  diabetes .PERIOD not  fighting  the  organization  that  's  fighting  it ,COMMA fighting  with  them ,COMMA leading  them ,COMMA connecting  them ,COMMA challenging  the  status  quo  because  it  's  important  to  him .PERIOD and  the  people  he  surrounds  himself  with  need  the  connection .PERIOD they  need  the  leadership .PERIOD it  makes  a  difference .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  permission  from  people  to  lead  them .PERIOD but  in  case  you  do ,COMMA here  it  is: .PERIOD they  're  waiting ,COMMA we  're  waiting  for  you  to  show  us  where  to  go  next .PERIOD so  here  is  what  leaders  have  in  common .PERIOD the  first  thing  is ,COMMA they  challenge  the  status  quo .PERIOD they  challenge  what  's  currently  there .PERIOD the  second  thing  is ,COMMA they  build  a  culture .PERIOD a  secret  language ,COMMA a  seven-second  handshake .PERIOD a  way  of  knowing  that  you  're  in  or  out .PERIOD they  have  curiosity .PERIOD curiosity  about  people  in  the  tribe .PERIOD curiosity  about  outsiders .PERIOD they  're  asking  questions .PERIOD they  connect  people  to  one  another .PERIOD do  you  know  what  people  want  more  than  anything ?QUESTIONMARK they  want  to  be  missed .PERIOD they  want  to  be  missed  the  day  they  do  n't  show  up .PERIOD they  want  to  be  missed  when  they  're  gone .PERIOD and  tribe  leaders  can  do  that .PERIOD it  's  fascinating ,COMMA because  all  tribe  leaders  have  charisma .PERIOD but  you  do  n't  need  charisma  to  become  a  leader .PERIOD being  a  leader  gives  you  charisma .PERIOD if  you  look  and  study  the  leaders  who  have  succeeded ,COMMA that  's  where  charisma  comes  from ,COMMA from  the  leading .PERIOD finally ,COMMA they  commit .PERIOD they  commit  to  the  cause .PERIOD they  commit  to  the  tribe .PERIOD they  commit  to  the  people  who  are  there .PERIOD so  i'd  like  you  to  do  something  for  me .PERIOD and  i  hope  you  'll  think  about  it  before  you  reject  it  out-of-hand .PERIOD what  i  want  you  to  do ,COMMA it  only  takes  24  hours ,COMMA is ,COMMA create  a  movement .PERIOD something  that  matters .PERIOD start .PERIOD do  it .PERIOD we  need  it .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD i  appreciate  it .PERIOD i  told  you  three  things  last  year .PERIOD i  told  you  that  the  statistics  of  the  world  have  not  been  made  properly  available .PERIOD because  of  that ,COMMA we  still  have  the  old  mindset  of  developing  in  industrialized  countries ,COMMA which  is  wrong .PERIOD and  that  animated  graphics  can  make  a  difference .PERIOD things  are  changing .PERIOD and  today ,COMMA on  the  united  nations  statistic  division  home  page ,COMMA it  says ,COMMA by  first  of  may ,COMMA full  access  to  the  databases .PERIOD and  if  i  could  share  the  image  with  you  on  the  screen .PERIOD so  three  things  have  happened .PERIOD un .PERIOD opened  their  statistic  databases ,COMMA and  we  have  a  new  version  of  the  software  up  working  as  a  beta  on  the  net ,COMMA so  you  do  n't  have  to  download  it  any  longer .PERIOD and  let  me  repeat  what  you  saw  last  year .PERIOD the  bubbles  are  the  countries .PERIOD here  you  have  the  fertility  rate ,COMMA the  number  of  children  per  woman ,COMMA and  there  you  have  the  length  of  life  in  years .PERIOD this  is  1950 ,COMMA those  were  the  industrialized  countries ,COMMA those  were  developing  countries .PERIOD at  that  time  there  was  a  we  and  them .PERIOD there  was  a  huge  difference  in  the  world .PERIOD but  then  it  changed ,COMMA and  it  went  on  quite  well .PERIOD and  this  is  what  happens .PERIOD you  can  see  how  china  is  the  red ,COMMA big  bubble .PERIOD the  blue  there  is  india .PERIOD a  little  more  serious  this  year  in  showing  you  how  things  really  changed .PERIOD and  it  's  africa  that  stands  out  as  the  problem  down  here ,COMMA does  n't  it ?QUESTIONMARK large  families  still ,COMMA and  the  hiv  epidemic  brought  down  the  countries  like  this .PERIOD this  is  more  or  less  what  we  saw  last  year ,COMMA and  this  is  how  it  will  go  on  into  the  future .PERIOD and  i  will  talk  on ,COMMA is  this  possible ?QUESTIONMARK because  you  see  now ,COMMA i  presented  statistics  that  do  n't  exist .PERIOD because  this  is  where  we  are .PERIOD will  it  be  possible  that  this  will  happen ?QUESTIONMARK i  cover  my  lifetime  here ,COMMA you  know ?QUESTIONMARK i  expect  to  live  100  years .PERIOD and  this  is  where  we  are  today .PERIOD now  could  we  look  here  instead  at  the  economic  situation  in  the  world ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  would  like  to  show  that  against  child  survival .PERIOD we  'll  swap  the  axis .PERIOD here  you  have  child  mortality ,COMMA that  is ,COMMA survival ,COMMA four  kids  dying  there ,COMMA 200  dying  there .PERIOD and  this  is  gdp  per  capita  on  this  axis .PERIOD and  this  was  2007 .PERIOD and  if  i  go  back  in  time ,COMMA i've  added  some  historical  statistics ,COMMA here  we  go ,COMMA here  we  go ,COMMA here  we  go ,COMMA not  so  much  statistics  100  years  ago .PERIOD some  countries  still  had  statistics .PERIOD we  are  looking  down  in  the  archive ,COMMA and  when  we  are  down  into  1820 ,COMMA there  is  only  austria  and  sweden  that  can  produce  numbers .PERIOD but  they  were  down  here .PERIOD they  had  1,000  dollars  per  person  per  year .PERIOD and  they  lost  one-fifth  of  their  kids  before  their  first  birthday .PERIOD so  this  is  what  happens  in  the  world ,COMMA if  we  play  the  entire  world .PERIOD how  they  got  slowly  richer  and  richer ,COMMA and  they  add  statistics .PERIOD is  n't  it  beautiful  when  they  get  statistics ?QUESTIONMARK you  see  the  importance  of  that ?QUESTIONMARK and  here ,COMMA children  do  n't  live  longer .PERIOD the  last  century ,COMMA 1870 ,COMMA was  bad  for  the  kids  in  europe ,COMMA because  most  of  this  statistics  is  europe .PERIOD it  was  only  by  the  turn  of  the  century  that  more  than  90  percent  of  the  children  survived  their  first  year .PERIOD this  is  india  coming  up ,COMMA with  the  first  data  from  india .PERIOD and  this  is  the  united  states  moving  away  here ,COMMA earning  more  money .PERIOD and  we  will  soon  see  china  coming  up  in  the  very  far  end  corner  here .PERIOD and  it  moves  up  with  mao  tse-tung  getting  health ,COMMA not  getting  so  rich .PERIOD there  he  died ,COMMA then  deng  xiaoping  brings  money .PERIOD it  moves  this  way  over  here .PERIOD and  the  bubbles  keep  moving  up  there ,COMMA and  this  is  what  the  world  looks  like  today .PERIOD let  us  have  a  look  at  the  united  states .PERIOD we  have  a  function  here ,COMMA i  can  tell  the  world ,COMMA stay  where  you  are  and  i  take  the  united  states ,COMMA we  still  want  to  see  the  background ,COMMA i  put  them  up  like  this ,COMMA and  now  we  go  backwards .PERIOD and  we  can  see  that  the  united  states  goes  to  the  right  of  the  mainstream .PERIOD they  are  on  the  money  side  all  the  time .PERIOD and  down  in  1915 ,COMMA the  united  states  was  a  neighbor  of  india ,COMMA present ,COMMA contemporary  india .PERIOD and  that  means  united  states  was  richer ,COMMA but  lost  more  kids  than  india  is  doing  today ,COMMA proportionally .PERIOD and  look  here ,COMMA compare  to  the  philippines  of  today .PERIOD the  philippines  of  today  has  almost  the  same  economy  as  the  united  states  during  the  first  world  war .PERIOD but  we  have  to  bring  united  states  forward  quite  a  while  to  find  the  same  health  of  the  united  states  as  we  have  in  the  philippines .PERIOD about  1957  here ,COMMA the  health  of  the  united  states  is  the  same  as  the  philippines .PERIOD and  this  is  the  drama  of  this  world  which  many  call  globalized ,COMMA is  that  asia ,COMMA arabic  countries ,COMMA latin  america ,COMMA are  much  more  ahead  in  being  healthy ,COMMA educated ,COMMA having  human  resources  than  they  are  economically .PERIOD there  's  a  discrepancy  in  what  's  happening  today  in  the  emerging  economies .PERIOD there  now ,COMMA social  benefits ,COMMA social  progress ,COMMA are  going  ahead  of  economical  progress .PERIOD and  1957 ,COMMA the  united  states  had  the  same  economy  as  chile  has  today .PERIOD and  how  long  do  we  have  to  bring  united  states  to  get  the  same  health  as  chile  has  today ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  we  have  to  go ,COMMA there ,COMMA we  have  2001 ,COMMA or  2002 ,COMMA the  united  states  has  the  same  health  as  chile .PERIOD chile  's  catching  up .PERIOD within  some  years  chile  may  have  better  child  survival  than  the  united  states .PERIOD this  is  really  a  change ,COMMA that  you  have  this  lag  of  more  or  less  30 ,COMMA 40  years  difference  on  the  health .PERIOD and  behind  the  health  is  the  educational  level .PERIOD and  there  's  a  lot  of  infrastructure  things ,COMMA and  general  human  resources  are  there .PERIOD now  we  can  take  away  this ,COMMA and  i  would  like  to  show  you  the  rate  of  speed ,COMMA the  rate  of  change ,COMMA how  fast  they  have  gone .PERIOD and  we  go  back  to  1920 ,COMMA and  i  want  to  look  at  japan .PERIOD and  i  want  to  look  at  sweden  and  the  united  states .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  stage  a  race  here  between  this  sort  of  yellowish  ford  here  and  the  red  toyota  down  there ,COMMA and  the  brownish  volvo .PERIOD and  here  we  go .PERIOD here  we  go .PERIOD the  toyota  has  a  very  bad  start  down  here ,COMMA you  can  see ,COMMA and  the  united  states  ford  is  going  off-road  there .PERIOD and  the  volvo  is  doing  quite  fine .PERIOD this  is  the  war .PERIOD the  toyota  got  off  track ,COMMA and  now  the  toyota  is  coming  on  the  healthier  side  of  sweden ,COMMA can  you  see  that ?QUESTIONMARK and  they  are  taking  over  sweden ,COMMA and  they  are  now  healthier  than  sweden .PERIOD that  's  the  part  where  i  sold  the  volvo  and  bought  the  toyota .PERIOD and  now  we  can  see  that  the  rate  of  change  was  enormous  in  japan .PERIOD they  really  caught  up .PERIOD and  this  changes  gradually .PERIOD we  have  to  look  over  generations  to  understand  it .PERIOD and  let  me  show  you  my  own  sort  of

on  the  hindu  ritual  of  darshan .PERIOD hindus  do  n't  have  the  concept  of  commandments .PERIOD so ,COMMA there  is  nothing  right  or  wrong  in  what  you  do  in  life .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  're  not  really  sure  how  you  stand  in  front  of  god .PERIOD so ,COMMA when  you  go  to  the  temple ,COMMA all  you  seek  is  an  audience  with  god .PERIOD you  want  to  see  god .PERIOD and  you  want  god  to  see  you ,COMMA and  hence  the  gods  have  very  large  eyes ,COMMA large  unblinking  eyes ,COMMA sometimes  made  of  silver ,COMMA so  they  look  at  you .PERIOD because  you  do  n't  know  whether  you  're  right  or  wrong ,COMMA and  so  all  you  seek  is  divine  empathy .PERIOD just  know  where  i  came  from ,COMMA why  i  did  the  jugaad  why  did

,COMMA because  the  customer  is  god .PERIOD that  sensitivity  is  what  we  need .PERIOD once  this  belief  enters ,COMMA behavior  will  happen ,COMMA business  will  happen .PERIOD and  it  has .PERIOD so ,COMMA then  we  come  back  to  alexander  and  to  the  gymnosophist .PERIOD and  everybody  asks  me ,COMMA which  is  the  better  way ,COMMA this  way  or  that  way  and  it  's  a  very  dangerous  question .PERIOD because  it  leads  you  to  the  path  of  fundamentalism  and  violence .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  will  not  answer  the  question .PERIOD what  i  will  give  you  is  an  indian  answer ,COMMA the  indian  head-shake .PERIOD depending  on  the  context ,COMMA depending  on  the  outcome ,COMMA choose  your  paradigm .PERIOD you  see ,COMMA because  both  the

,COMMA renting  them ,COMMA often  eight  or  10  people  to  a  room .PERIOD and  it  's  known  for  prostitution ,COMMA violence ,COMMA drugs: .PERIOD a  hard  place  to  grow  up .PERIOD and  when  we  were  walking  through  the  narrow  alleys ,COMMA it  was  literally  impossible  not  to  step  in  the  raw  sewage  and  the  garbage  alongside  the  little  homes .PERIOD but  at  the  same  time  it  was  also  impossible  not  to  see  the  human  vitality ,COMMA the  aspiration  and  the  ambition  of  the  people  who  live  there: .PERIOD women  washing  their  babies ,COMMA washing  their  clothes ,COMMA hanging  them  out  to  dry .PERIOD i  met  this  woman ,COMMA mama  rose ,COMMA who  has  rented  that  little  tin  shack  for  32  years ,COMMA where  she  lives  with  her  seven  children .PERIOD four  sleep  in  one  twin  bed ,COMMA and  three  sleep  on  the  mud  and  linoleum  floor .PERIOD and  she  keeps  them  all  in  school  by  selling  water  from  that  kiosk ,COMMA and  from  selling  soap  and  bread  from  the  little  store  inside .PERIOD it  was  also  the  day  after  the  inauguration ,COMMA and  i  was  reminded  how  mathare  is  still  connected  to  the  globe .PERIOD and  i  would  see  kids  on  the  street  corners .PERIOD and  they'd  say  obama ,COMMA he  's  our  brother .PERIOD and  i'd  say  well ,COMMA obama  's  my  brother ,COMMA so  that  makes  you  my  brother  too .PERIOD and  they  would  look  quizzically ,COMMA and  then  be  like ,COMMA high  five .PERIOD and  it  was  here  that  i  met  jane .PERIOD i  was  struck  immediately  by  the  kindness  and  the  gentleness  in  her  face ,COMMA and  i  asked  her  to  tell  me  her  story .PERIOD she  started  off  by  telling  me  her  dream .PERIOD she  said ,COMMA i  had  two .PERIOD my  first  dream  was  to  be  a  doctor ,COMMA and  the  second  was  to  marry  a  good  man  who  would  stay  with  me  and  my  family .PERIOD because  my  mother  was  a  single  mom ,COMMA and  could  n't  afford  to  pay  for  school  fees .PERIOD so  i  had  to  give  up  the  first  dream ,COMMA and  i  focused  on  the  second .PERIOD she  got  married  when  she  was  18 ,COMMA had  a  baby  right  away .PERIOD and  when  she  turned  20 ,COMMA found  herself  pregnant  with  a  second  child ,COMMA her  mom  died  and  her  husband  left  her ,COMMA married  another  woman .PERIOD so  she  was  again  in  mathare ,COMMA with  no  income ,COMMA no  skill  set ,COMMA no  money .PERIOD and  so  she  ultimately  turned  to  prostitution .PERIOD it  was  n't  organized  in  the  way  we  often  think  of  it .PERIOD she  would  go  into  the  city  at  night  with  about  20  girls ,COMMA look  for  work ,COMMA and  sometimes  come  back  with  a  few  shillings .PERIOD or  sometimes  with  nothing .PERIOD and  she  said ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA the  poverty  was  n't  so  bad .PERIOD it  was  the  humiliation .PERIOD and  the  embarrassment  of  it  all .PERIOD in  2001 ,COMMA her  life  changed .PERIOD she  had  a  girlfriend  who  had  heard  about  this  organization ,COMMA jamii  bora ,COMMA that  would  lend  money  to  people  no  matter  how  poor  you  were ,COMMA as  long  as  you  provided  a  commensurate  amount  in  savings .PERIOD and  so  she  spent  a  year  to  save  50  dollars ,COMMA and  started  borrowing ,COMMA and  over  time  she  was  able  to  buy  a  sewing  machine .PERIOD she  started  tailoring .PERIOD and  that  turned  into  what  she  does  now ,COMMA which  is  to  go  into  the  secondhand  clothing  markets ,COMMA and  for  about  three  dollars  and  25  cents  she  buys  an  old  ball  gown .PERIOD some  of  them  might  be  ones  you  gave .PERIOD and  she  repurposes  them  with  frills  and  ribbons ,COMMA and  makes  these  frothy  confections  that  she  sells  to  women  for  their  daughter  's  sweet  16  or  first  holy  communion ,COMMA those  milestones  in  a  life  that  people  want  to  celebrate .PERIOD all  along  the  economic  spectrum .PERIOD and  she  does  really  good  business .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA i  watched  her  walk  through  the  streets  hawking .PERIOD and  before  you  knew  it ,COMMA there  was  a  crowd  of  women  around  her ,COMMA buying  these  dresses .PERIOD and  i  reflected ,COMMA as  i  was  watching  her  sell  the  dresses ,COMMA and  also  the  jewelry  that  she  makes ,COMMA that  now  jane  makes  more  than  four  dollars  a  day .PERIOD and  by  many  definitions  she  is  no  longer  poor .PERIOD but  she  still  lives  in  mathare  valley .PERIOD and  so  she  cannot  move  out .PERIOD she  lives  with  all  of  that  insecurity ,COMMA and  in  fact ,COMMA in  january ,COMMA during  the  ethnic  riots ,COMMA she  was  chased  from  her  home  and  had  to  find  a  new  shack .PERIOD in  which  she  would  live .PERIOD jamii  bora  understands  that  and  understands  that  when  we  're  talking  about  poverty ,COMMA we've  got  to  look  at  people  all  along  the  economic  spectrum .PERIOD and  so  with  patient  capital  from  acumen  and  other  organizations ,COMMA loans  and  investments  that  will  go  the  long  term  with  them ,COMMA they  built  a  low-cost  housing  development ,COMMA about  an  hour  outside  nairobi  central .PERIOD and  they  designed  it  from  the  perspective  of  customers  like  jane  herself ,COMMA insisting  on  responsibility  and  accountability .PERIOD so  she  has  to  give  10  percent  of  the  mortgage ,COMMA of  the  total  value ,COMMA or  about  400  dollars  in  savings .PERIOD and  then  they  match  her  mortgage  to  what  she  paid  in  rent  for  her  little  shanty .PERIOD and  in  the  next  couple  of  weeks ,COMMA she  's  going  to  be  among  the  first  200  families  to  move  into  this  development .PERIOD when  i  asked  her  if  she  feared  anything ,COMMA or  whether  she  would  miss  anything  from  mathare ,COMMA she  said ,COMMA what  would  i  fear .PERIOD that  i  have  n't  confronted  already ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  hiv  positive .PERIOD i've  dealt  with  it  all .PERIOD and  she  said ,COMMA what  would  i  miss ?QUESTIONMARK you  think  i  will  miss  the  violence  or  the  drugs ?QUESTIONMARK the  lack  of  privacy ?QUESTIONMARK do  you  think  i  'll  miss  not  knowing  if  my  children  are  going  to  come  home  at  the  end  of  the  day  she  said  if  you  gave  me  10  minutes .PERIOD my  bags  would  be  packed .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA well  what  about  your  dreams ?QUESTIONMARK and  she  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA my  dreams  do  n't  look  exactly  like  i  thought  they  would  when  i  was  a  little  girl .PERIOD but  if  i  think  about  it ,COMMA i  thought  i  wanted  a  husband ,COMMA but  what  i  really  wanted  was  a  family .PERIOD that  was  loving .PERIOD and  i  fiercely  love  my  children ,COMMA and  they  love  me  back .PERIOD she  said ,COMMA i  thought  that  i  wanted  to  be  a  doctor ,COMMA but  what  i  really  wanted  to  be  was  somebody .PERIOD who  served  and  healed  and  cured .PERIOD and  so  i  feel  so  blessed  with  everything  that  i  have ,COMMA that  two  days  a  week  i  go  and  i  counsel  hiv  patients .PERIOD and  i  say ,COMMA look  at  me .PERIOD you  are  not  dead .PERIOD you  are  still  alive .PERIOD and  if  you  are  still  alive  you  have  to  serve' .PERIOD and  she  said ,COMMA i  'm  not  a  doctor  who  gives  out  pills .PERIOD but  maybe  me ,COMMA i  give  out  something  better .PERIOD because  i  give  them  hope .PERIOD and  in  the  middle  of  this  economic  crisis ,COMMA where  so  many  of  us  are  inclined  to  pull  in  with  fear ,COMMA i  think  we  're  well  suited  to  take  a  cue  from  jane  and  reach  out ,COMMA recognizing  that  being  poor  does  n't  mean  being  ordinary .PERIOD because  when  systems  are  broken ,COMMA like  the  ones  that  we  're  seeing  around  the  world ,COMMA it  's  an  opportunity  for  invention  and  for  innovation .PERIOD it  's  an  opportunity  to  truly  build  a  world  where  we  can  extend  services  and  products  to  all  human  beings ,COMMA so  that  they  can  make  decisions  and  choices  for  themselves .PERIOD i  truly  believe  it  's  where  dignity  starts .PERIOD we  owe  it  to  the  janes  of  the  world .PERIOD and  just  as  important ,COMMA we  owe  it  to  ourselves .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD this  is  the  first  of  two  rather  extraordinary  photographs  i  'm  going  to  show  you  today .PERIOD it  was  taken  18  years  ago .PERIOD i  was  19  years  old  at  the  time .PERIOD i  had  just  returned  from  one  of  the  deepest  dives  i'd  ever  made  at  that  time, ,COMMA a  little  over  200  feet  -- .PERIOD and ,COMMA i  had  caught  this  little  fish  here .PERIOD it  turns  out  that  that  particular  one  was  the  first  live  one  of  that  ever  taken  alive .PERIOD i  'm  not  just  an  ichthyologist ,COMMA i  'm  a  bona  fide  fish  nerd .PERIOD and  to  a  fish  nerd ,COMMA this  is  some  pretty  exciting  stuff .PERIOD and  more  exciting  was  the  fact  that  the  person  who  took  this  photo  was  a  guy  named  jack  randall ,COMMA the  greatest  living  ichthyologist  on  earth ,COMMA the  grand  poobah  of  fish  nerds ,COMMA if  you  will .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA it  was  really  exciting  to  me  to  have  this  moment  in  time ,COMMA it  really  set  the  course  for  the  rest  of  my  life .PERIOD but  really  the  most  significant  thing ,COMMA the  most  profound  thing  about  this  picture  is  that  it  was  taken  two  days  before  i  was  completely  paralyzed  from  the  neck  down .PERIOD i  made  a  really  stupid  kind  of  mistake  that  most  19-year-old  males  do  when  they  think  they  're  immortal ,COMMA and  i  got  a  bad  case  of  the  bends ,COMMA and  was  paralyzed ,COMMA and  had  to  be  flown  back  for  treatment .PERIOD i  learned  two  really  important  things  that  day .PERIOD the  first  thing  i  learned ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  'm  mortal ,COMMA that  's  a  really  big  one .PERIOD and  the  second  thing  i  learned  was  that  i  knew ,COMMA with  profound  certainty ,COMMA that  this  is  exactly  what  i  was  going  to  do  for  the  rest  of  my  life .PERIOD i  had  to  focus  all  my  energies  towards  going  to  find  new  species  of  things  down  on  deep  coral  reefs .PERIOD now ,COMMA when  you  think  of  a  coral  reef ,COMMA this  is  what  most  people  think  of ,COMMA all  these  big ,COMMA hard ,COMMA elaborate  corals  and  lots  of  bright ,COMMA colorful  fishes  and  things .PERIOD but ,COMMA this  is  really  just  the  tip  of  the  iceberg .PERIOD if  you  look  at  this  diagram  of  a  coral  reef ,COMMA we  know  a  lot  about  that  part  up  near  the  top ,COMMA and  the  reason  we  know  so  much  about  it  is  scuba  divers  can  very  easily  go  down  there  and  access  it .PERIOD there  is  a  problem  with  scuba  though ,COMMA in  that  it  imposes  some  limitations  on  how  deep  you  can  go ,COMMA and  it  turns  out  that  depth  is  about  200  feet .PERIOD i  'll  get  into  why  that  is  in  just  a  minute .PERIOD but ,COMMA the  point  is  that  scuba  divers  generally  stay  less  than  100  feet  deep ,COMMA and  very  rarely  go  much  below  this ,COMMA at  least ,COMMA not  with  any  kind  of  sanity .PERIOD so ,COMMA to  go  deeper ,COMMA most  biologists  have  turned  to  submersibles .PERIOD now ,COMMA submersibles  are  great ,COMMA wonderful  things ,COMMA but  if  you  're  going  to  spend  30,000  dollars  a  day  to  use  one  of  these  things ,COMMA and  it  's  capable  of  going  2,000  feet ,COMMA you  're  sure  not  going  to  go  farting  around  up  here  in  a  couple  of  hundred  feet ,COMMA you  're  going  to  go  way ,COMMA way ,COMMA way ,COMMA down  deep .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  bottom  line  is  that  almost  all  research  using  submersibles  has  taken  place  well  below  500  feet .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  's  pretty  obvious  at  this  point  that  there  's  this  zone  here  in  the  middle  and  that  's  the  zone  that  really  centers  around  my  own  personal  pursuit  of  happiness .PERIOD i  want  to  find  out  what  's  in  this  zone .PERIOD we  know  almost  nothing  about  it .PERIOD scuba  divers  cannot  get  there ,COMMA submarines  go  right  on  past  it .PERIOD it  took  me  a  year  to  learn  how  to  walk  again  after  i  had  my  diving  accident  in  palau  and  during  that  year  i  spent  a  lot  of  time  learning  about  the  physics  and  physiology  of  diving  and  figuring  out  how  to  overcome  these  limitations .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  'm  just  going  to  show  you  a  basic  idea .PERIOD we  're  all  breathing  air  right  now .PERIOD air  is  a  mixture  of  oxygen  and  nitrogen ,COMMA about  20  percent  oxygen .PERIOD about  80  percent  nitrogen  is  in  our  lungs .PERIOD and  there  's  a  phenomenon  called  henry  's  law  that  says  that  gases  will  dissolve  into  a  fluid  in  proportion  to  the  partial  pressures  which  you  're  exposing  them  to .PERIOD so ,COMMA basically  the  gas  dissolves  into  our  body .PERIOD the  oxygen  is  bound  by  metabolism ,COMMA we  use  it  for  energy .PERIOD the  nitrogen  just  sort  of  floats  around  in  our  blood  and  tissues ,COMMA and  that  's  all  fine ,COMMA that  's  how  we  're  designed .PERIOD the  problem  happens  when  you  start  to  go  underwater .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  deeper  you  go  underwater ,COMMA the  higher  the  pressure  is .PERIOD if  you  were  to  go  down  to  a  depth  of  about  130  feet ,COMMA which  is  the  recommended  limit  for  most  scuba  divers ,COMMA you  get  this  pressure  effect .PERIOD and  the  effect  of  that  pressure  is  that  you  have  an  increased  density  of  gas  molecules  in  every  breath  you  take .PERIOD over  time ,COMMA those  gas  molecules  dissolve  into  your  blood  and  tissues  and  start  to  fill  you  up .PERIOD now ,COMMA if  you  were  to  go  down  to ,COMMA say ,COMMA 300  feet ,COMMA you  do  n't  have  five  times  as  many  gas  molecules  in  your  lungs ,COMMA you've  got  10  times  as  many  gas  molecules  in  your  lungs .PERIOD and ,COMMA sure  enough ,COMMA they  dissolve  into  your  blood ,COMMA and  into  your  tissues  as  well .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA if  you  were  to  down  to  where  there  's  15  times  as  much ,COMMA the  deeper  you  go ,COMMA the  more  exacerbating  the  problem  becomes .PERIOD and  the  problem ,COMMA the  limitation  of  diving  with  air  is  all  those  dots  in  your  body ,COMMA all  the  nitrogen  and  all  the  oxygen .PERIOD there  're  three  basic  limitations  of  scuba  diving .PERIOD the  first  limitation  is  the  oxygen ,COMMA oxygen  toxicity .PERIOD now ,COMMA we  all  know  the  song ,COMMA love  is  like  oxygen/ .PERIOD you  get  too  much ,COMMA you  get  too  high/ .PERIOD not  enough ,COMMA and  you  're  going  to  die .PERIOD well ,COMMA in  the  context  of  diving ,COMMA you  get  too  much ,COMMA you  die  also .PERIOD you  die  also  because  oxygen  toxicity  can  cause  a  seizure ,COMMA makes  you  convulse  underwater ,COMMA not  a  good  thing  to  happen  underwater .PERIOD it  happens  because  there  's  too  much  concentration  of  oxygen  in  your  body .PERIOD the  nitrogen  has  two  problems .PERIOD one  of  them  is  what  jacques  cousteau  called  rapture  of  the  deep .PERIOD it  's  nitrogen  narcosis .PERIOD it  makes  you  loopy .PERIOD the  deeper  you  go ,COMMA the  loopier  you  get .PERIOD you  do  n't  want  to  drive  drunk ,COMMA you  do  n't  want  to  dive  drunk ,COMMA so  that  's  a  real  big  problem .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA the  third  problem  is  the  one  i  found  out  the  hard  way  in  palau ,COMMA which  is  the  bends .PERIOD now  the  one  thing  that  i  forgot  to  mention ,COMMA is  that  to  obviate  the  problem  of  the  nitrogen  narcosis ,COMMA all  of  those  blue  dots  in  our  body ,COMMA you  remove  the  nitrogen  and  you  replace  it  with  helium .PERIOD now  helium  's  a  gas ,COMMA there  're  a  lot  of  reasons  why  helium  's  good ,COMMA it  's  a  tiny  molecule ,COMMA it  's  inert ,COMMA it  does  n't  give  you  narcosis .PERIOD so  that  's  the  basic  concept  that  we  use .PERIOD but ,COMMA the  theory  's  relatively  easy .PERIOD the  tricky  part  is  the  implementation .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  is  how  i  began ,COMMA about  15  years  ago .PERIOD i  'll  admit ,COMMA it  was  n't  exactly  the  smartest  of  starts ,COMMA but ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  got  to  start  somewhere .PERIOD at  the  time ,COMMA i  was  n't  the  only  one  who  did  n't  know  what  i  was  doing ,COMMA almost  nobody  did .PERIOD and  this  rig  was  actually  used  for  a  dive  of  300  feet .PERIOD over  time  we  got  a  little  bit  better  at  it ,COMMA and  we  came  up  with  this  really  sophisticated-looking  rig  with  four  scuba  tanks  and  five  regulators  and  all  the  right  gas  mixtures  and  all  that  good  stuff .PERIOD and  it  was  fine  and  dandy ,COMMA and  it  allowed  us  to  go  down  and  find  new  species .PERIOD this  picture  was  taken  300  feet  deep ,COMMA catching  new  species  of  fish .PERIOD but ,COMMA the  problem  was  that  it  did  n't  allow  us  much  time .PERIOD for  all  its  bulk  and  size ,COMMA it  only  gave  us  about  15  minutes  at  most  down  at  those  sorts  of  depths .PERIOD we  needed  more  time .PERIOD there  had  to  be  a  better  way .PERIOD and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA there  is  a  better  way .PERIOD in  1994 ,COMMA i  was  fortunate  enough  to  get  access  to  these  prototype  closed-circuit  rebreathers .PERIOD alright ,COMMA closed-circuit  rebreather ,COMMA what  is  it  about  it  that  makes  it  different  from  scuba ,COMMA and  why  is  it  better ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA there  are  three  main  advantages  to  a  rebreather .PERIOD one ,COMMA they  're  quiet ,COMMA they  do  n't  make  any  noise .PERIOD two ,COMMA they  allow  you  to  stay  underwater  longer .PERIOD three ,COMMA they  allow  you  to  go  deeper .PERIOD how  is  it  that  they  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA in  order  to  really  understand  how  they  do  that  you  have  to  take  off  the  hood ,COMMA and  look  underneath  and  see  what  's  going  on .PERIOD there  are  three  basic  systems  to  a  closed-  circuit  rebreather .PERIOD the  most  fundamental  of  these  is  called  the  breathing  loop .PERIOD it  's  a  breathing  loop  because  you  breathe  off  of  it ,COMMA and  it  's  a  closed  loop ,COMMA and  you  breathe  the  same  gas  around  and  around  and  around .PERIOD so  there  's  a  mouthpiece  that  you  put  in  your  mouth ,COMMA and  there  's  also  a  counterlung ,COMMA or  in  this  case ,COMMA two  counterlungs .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  counterlungs  are  n't  high-tech ,COMMA they  're  just  simply  flexible  bags .PERIOD they  allow  you  to  mechanically  breathe ,COMMA or  mechanically  ventilate .PERIOD when  you  exhale  your  breath ,COMMA it  goes  in  the  exhale  counterlung ,COMMA when  you  inhale  a  breath ,COMMA it  comes  from  the  inhale  counterlung .PERIOD it  's  just  pure  mechanics ,COMMA allowing  you  to  cycle  air  through  this  breathing  loop .PERIOD and ,COMMA the  other  component  on  a  breathing  loop  is  the  carbon  dioxide  absorbent  canister .PERIOD now ,COMMA as  we  breathe ,COMMA we  produce  carbon  dioxide ,COMMA and  that  carbon  dioxide  needs  to  be  scrubbed  out  of  the  system .PERIOD there  's  a  chemical  filter  in  there  that  pulls  the  carbon  dioxide  out  of  the  breathing  gas ,COMMA so  that ,COMMA when  it  comes  back  to  us  to  breathe  again ,COMMA it  's  safe  to  breathe  again .PERIOD so  that  's  the  breathing  loop  in  a  nutshell .PERIOD the  second  main  component  of  a  closed-circuit  rebreather  is  the  gas  system .PERIOD the  primary  purpose  of  the  gas  system  is  to  provide  oxygen ,COMMA to  replenish  the  oxygen  that  your  body  consumes .PERIOD so  the  main  tank ,COMMA the  main  critical  thing ,COMMA is  this  oxygen  gas  supply  cylinder  we  have  here .PERIOD but ,COMMA if  we  only  had  an  oxygen  gas  supply  cylinder  we  would  n't  be  able  to  go  very  deep ,COMMA because  we'd  run  into  oxygen  toxicity  very ,COMMA very  quickly .PERIOD so  we  need  another  gas ,COMMA something  to  dilute  the  oxygen  with .PERIOD and  that ,COMMA fittingly  enough ,COMMA is  called  the  diluent  gas  supply .PERIOD in  our  applications ,COMMA we  generally  put  air  inside  this  diluent  gas  supply ,COMMA because  it  's  a  very  cheap  and  easy  source  of  nitrogen .PERIOD so  that  's  where  we  get  our  nitrogen  from .PERIOD but ,COMMA if  we  want  to  go  deeper ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA we  need  another  gas  supply .PERIOD we  need  helium ,COMMA and  the  helium  is  what  we  really  need  to  go  deep .PERIOD and  usually  we  'll  have  a  slightly  larger  cylinder  mounted  exterior  on  the  rebreather ,COMMA like  this .PERIOD and  that  's  what  we  use  to  inject ,COMMA as  we  start  to  do  our  deep  dives .PERIOD we  also  have  a  second  oxygen  cylinder ,COMMA that  's  solely  as  a  back-up  in  case  there  's  a  problem  with  our  first  oxygen  supply  we  can  continue  to  breathe .PERIOD and  the  way  you  manage  all  these  different  gases  and  all  these  different  gas  supplies  is  this  really  high-tech ,COMMA sophisticated  gas  block  up  on  the  front  here ,COMMA where  it  's  easy  to  reach .PERIOD it  's  got  all  the  valves  and  knobs  and  things  you  need  to  do  to  inject  the  right  gases  at  the  right  time .PERIOD now ,COMMA normally  you  do  n't  have  to  do  that  because  all  of  it  's  done  automatically  for  you  with  the  electronics ,COMMA the  third  system  of  a  rebreather .PERIOD the  most  critical  part  of  a  rebreather  is  the  oxygen  sensors .PERIOD you  need  three  of  them ,COMMA so  that  if  one  of  them  goes  bad ,COMMA you  know  which  one  it  is .PERIOD you  need  voting  logic .PERIOD you  also  have  three  microprocessors .PERIOD any  one  of  those  computers  can  run  the  entire  system ,COMMA so  if  you  have  to  lose  two  of  them .PERIOD there  's  also  back-up  power  supplies .PERIOD and  of  course  there  're  multiple  displays ,COMMA to  get  the  information  to  the  diver .PERIOD this  is  the  high-tech  gadgetry  that  allows  us  to  do  what  we  do  on  these  kinds  of  deep  dives .PERIOD and  i  can  talk  about  it  all  day ,COMMA just  ask  my  wife  -- .PERIOD but  i  want  to  move  on  to  something  that  's  kind  of  much  more  interesting .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  take  you  on  a  deep  dive .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  show  you  what  it  's  like  to  do  one  of  these  dives  that  we  do .PERIOD we  start  up  here  on  the  boat ,COMMA and  for  all  this  high-tech ,COMMA expensive  equipment ,COMMA this  is  still  the  best  way  to  get  in  the  water ,COMMA just  pfft ,COMMA flop  over  the  side  of  the  boat .PERIOD now ,COMMA as  i  showed  you  in  the  earlier  diagram ,COMMA these  reefs  that  we  dive  on  start  out  near  the  surface  and  they  go  almost  vertically ,COMMA completely  straight  down .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  drop  in  the  water ,COMMA and  we  just  sort  of  go  over  the  edge  of  this  cliff ,COMMA and  then  we  just  start  dropping ,COMMA dropping ,COMMA dropping .PERIOD people  have  asked  me ,COMMA it  must  take  a  long  time  to  get  there ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA it  only  takes  a  couple  of  minutes  to  get  all  the  way  down  to  three  or  four  hundred  feet ,COMMA which  is  where  we  're  aiming  for .PERIOD it  's  kind  of  like  skydiving  in  slow  motion .PERIOD it  's  really  a  very  interesting ,COMMA you  ever  see  the  abyss  where  ed  harris ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA he  's  sinking  down  along  the  side  of  the  wall ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  kind  of  what  it  feels  like .PERIOD it  's  pretty  amazing .PERIOD also ,COMMA when  you  get  down  there ,COMMA you  find  that  the  water  is  very ,COMMA very  clear .PERIOD it  's  extremely  clear  water ,COMMA because  there  's  hardly  any  plankton .PERIOD but ,COMMA when  you  turn  on  your  light ,COMMA you  look  around  at  the  caves ,COMMA and  all  of  a  sudden  you  're  confronted  with  a  tremendous  amount  of  diversity ,COMMA much  more  than  anyone  used  to  believe .PERIOD now  not  all  of  it  is  new  species ,COMMA like  that  fish  you  see  with  the  white  stripe ,COMMA that  's  a  known  species .PERIOD but ,COMMA if  you  look  carefully  into  the  cracks  and  crevices ,COMMA you  'll  see  little  things  scurrying  all  over  the  place .PERIOD there  's  a  just-unbelievable  diversity .PERIOD it  's  not  just  fish ,COMMA either .PERIOD these  are  crinoids ,COMMA sponges ,COMMA black  corals .PERIOD there  're  some  more  fishes .PERIOD and  those  fishes  that  you  see  right  now  are  new  species .PERIOD they  're  still  new  species  because  i  had  a  video  camera  on  this  dive  instead  of  my  net ,COMMA so  they  're  still  waiting  down  there  for  someone  to  go  find  them .PERIOD but  this  is  what  it  looks  like ,COMMA and  this  kind  of  habitat  just  goes  on  and  on  and  on  for  miles .PERIOD this  is  papua ,COMMA new  guinea .PERIOD now  little  fishes  and  invertebrates  are  n't  the  only  things  we  see  down  there .PERIOD we  also  see  sharks ,COMMA much  more  regularly  than  i  would  have  expected  to .PERIOD and  we  're  not  quite  sure  why .PERIOD but  what  i  want  you  to  do  right  now  is  imagine  yourself  400  feet  underwater ,COMMA with  all  this  high-tech  gear  on  your  back ,COMMA you  're  in  a  remote  reef  off  papua ,COMMA new  guinea ,COMMA thousands  of  miles  from  the  nearest  recompression  chamber ,COMMA and  you  're  completely  surrounded  by  sharks .PERIOD video ,COMMA look  at  those .PERIOD uh-oh .PERIOD uh-oh .PERIOD i  think  we  have  their  attention .PERIOD richard  pyle ,COMMA when  you  start  talking  like  donald  duck ,COMMA there  's  no  situation  in  the  world  that  can  seem  tense .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  're  down  there ,COMMA and  this  is  at  400  feet ,COMMA that  's  looking  straight  up ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA so  you  can  get  a  sense  of  how  far  away  the  surface  is .PERIOD and  if  you  're  a  biologist  and  you  know  about  sharks ,COMMA and  you  want  to  assess ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA how  much  jeopardy  am  i  really  in  here ,COMMA there  's  one  question  that  sort  of  jumps  to  the  forefront  of  your  mind  immediately  which  is ,COMMA diver  1   ,COMMA what  kind  of  sharks ?QUESTIONMARK diver  2 ,COMMA uh ,COMMA silvertip  sharks .PERIOD diver  1 ,COMMA oh .PERIOD rp ,COMMA silvertip  sharks ,COMMA they  're  actually  three  species  of  sharks  here .PERIOD the  silvertips  are  the  one  with  the  white  edges  on  the  fin ,COMMA and  there  're  also  gray  reef  sharks  and  some  hammerheads  off  in  the  distance .PERIOD and  yes ,COMMA it  's  a  little  nerve-wracking .PERIOD diver  2   ,COMMA hoo .PERIOD that  little  guy  is  frisky .PERIOD now ,COMMA you've  seen  video  like  this  on  tv  a  lot ,COMMA and  it  's  very  intimidating ,COMMA and  i  think  it  gives  the  wrong  impression  about  sharks .PERIOD sharks  are  actually  not  very  dangerous  animals  and  that  's  why  we  were  n't  worried  much ,COMMA why  we  were  joking  around  down  there .PERIOD more  people  are  killed  by  pigs ,COMMA more  people  are  killed  by  lightning  strikes ,COMMA more  people  are  killed  at  soccer  games  in  england .PERIOD there  's  a  lot  of  other  ways  you  can  die .PERIOD and  i  'm  not  making  that  stuff  up .PERIOD coconuts .PERIOD you  can  get  killed  by  a  coconut  more  likely  than  killed  by  a  shark .PERIOD so  sharks  are  n't  quite  as  dangerous  as  most  people  make  them  out  to  be .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  if  any  of  you  get  us .PERIOD news  and  world  report ,COMMA i  got  the  recent  issue .PERIOD there  's  a  cover  story  all  about  the  great  explorers  of  our  time .PERIOD the  last  article  is  an  article  entitled  no  new  frontiers .PERIOD it  questions  whether  or  not  there  really  are  any  new  frontiers  out  there ,COMMA whether  there  are  any  real ,COMMA true ,COMMA hardcore  discoveries  that  can  still  be  made .PERIOD and  this  is  my  favorite  line  from  the  article .PERIOD as  a  fish  nerd ,COMMA i  have  to  laugh ,COMMA because  you  know  they  do  n't  call  us  fish  nerds  for  nothing ,COMMA we  actually  do  get  excited  about  finding  a  new  dorsal  spine  in  a  guppy .PERIOD but ,COMMA it  's  much  more  than  that .PERIOD and ,COMMA i  want  to  show  you  a  few  of  the  guppies  we've  found  over  the  years .PERIOD this  one  's ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  can  see  how  ugly  it  is .PERIOD even  if  you  ignore  the  scientific  value  of  this  thing ,COMMA just  look  at  the  monetary  value  of  this  thing .PERIOD a  couple  of  these  ended  up  getting  sold  through  the  aquarium  trade  to  japan ,COMMA where  they  sold  for  15,000  dollars  apiece .PERIOD that  's  half-a-million  dollars  per  pound .PERIOD here  's  another  new  angelfish  we  discovered .PERIOD this  one  we  actually  first  discovered  back  in  the  air  days ,COMMA the  bad  old  air  days ,COMMA as  we  used  to  say ,COMMA when  we  were  doing  these  kind  of  dives  with  air .PERIOD we  were  at  360  feet .PERIOD and  i  remember  coming  up  from  one  of  these  deep  dives ,COMMA and  i  had  this  fog ,COMMA and  the  narcosis  takes  a  little  while  to ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA fade  away .PERIOD it  's  sort  of  like  sobering  up .PERIOD and  i  had  this  vague  recollection  of  seeing  these  yellow  fish  with  a  black  spot ,COMMA and  i  thought ,COMMA aw ,COMMA damn .PERIOD i  should  have  caught  one .PERIOD i  think  that  's  a  new  species  and  then ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA i  got  around  to  looking  in  my  bucket .PERIOD sure  enough ,COMMA i  had  caught  one ,COMMA i  just  completely  forgot  that  i  had  caught  one .PERIOD and  so  this  one  we  decided  to  give  the  name  centropyge  narcosis  to .PERIOD so  that  's  it  's  official  scientific  name ,COMMA in  reference  to  its  deep-dwelling  habits .PERIOD and  this  is  another  neat  one .PERIOD when  we  first  found  it ,COMMA we  were  n't  even  sure  what  family  this  thing  belonged  to ,COMMA so  we  just  called  it  the  dr.  seuss  fish ,COMMA because  it  looked  like  something  out  of  one  of  those  books .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  one  's  pretty  cool .PERIOD if  you  go  to  papua ,COMMA new  guinea ,COMMA and  go  down  300  feet ,COMMA you  're  going  to  see  these  big  mounds .PERIOD and  this  may  be  kind  of  hard  to  see ,COMMA but  they  're  about ,COMMA oh ,COMMA a  couple  meters  in  diameter .PERIOD if  you  look  closely ,COMMA you  'll  see  there  's  a  little  white  fish  and  gray  fish  that  hangs  out  near  them .PERIOD well ,COMMA it  turns  out  this  little  white  fish  builds  these  giant  mounds ,COMMA one  pebble  at  a  time .PERIOD it  's  really  extraordinary  to  find  something  like  this .PERIOD it  's  not  just  new  species ,COMMA it  's  new  behavior ,COMMA it  's  new  ecology  it  's  all  kind  of  new  things .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  i  'm  going  to  show  you  right  now ,COMMA very  quickly ,COMMA is  just  a  sampling  of  a  few  of  the  new  species  we've  discovered .PERIOD what  's  extraordinary  about  this  is  not  just  the  sheer  number  of  species  we  're  finding ,COMMA although  as  you  can  see  that  's  pretty  amazing ,COMMA this  is  only  half  of  what  we've  found ,COMMA what  's  extraordinary  is  how  quickly  we  find  them .PERIOD we  're  up  to  seven  new  species  per  hour  of  time  we  spend  at  that  depth .PERIOD now ,COMMA if  you  go  to  an  amazon  jungle  and  fog  a  tree ,COMMA you  may  get  a  lot  of  bugs ,COMMA but  for  fishes ,COMMA there  's  nowhere  in  the  world  you  can  get  seven  new  species  per  hour  of  time .PERIOD now ,COMMA we've  done  some  back  of  the  envelope  calculations ,COMMA and  we  're  predicting  that  there  are  probably  on  the  order  of  2,000  to  2,500  new  species  in  the  indo-pacific  alone .PERIOD there  are  only  five  to  six  thousand  known  species .PERIOD so  a  very  large  percentage  of  what  is  out  there  is  n't  really  known .PERIOD we  thought  we  had  a  handle  on  all  the  reef  fish  diversity ,COMMA evidently  not .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  just  close  on  a  very  somber  note .PERIOD at  the  beginning  i  told  you  that  i  was  going  to  show  you  two  extraordinary  photographs .PERIOD this  is  the  second  extraordinary  photograph  i  'm  going  to  show  you .PERIOD this  one  was  taken  at  the  exact  moment  i  was  down  there  filming  those  sharks .PERIOD this  was  taken  exactly  300  feet  above  my  head .PERIOD and  the  reason  this  photograph  is  extraordinary  is  because  it  captures  a  moment  in  the  very  last  minute  of  a  person  's  life .PERIOD less  than  60  seconds  after  this  picture  was  taken ,COMMA this  guy  was  dead .PERIOD when  we  recovered  his  body ,COMMA we  figured  out  what  had  gone  wrong .PERIOD he  had  made  a  very  simple  mistake .PERIOD he  turned  the  wrong  valve  when  he  filled  his  cylinder ,COMMA he  had  80  percent  oxygen  in  his  tank  when  he  should  have  had  40 .PERIOD he  had  an  oxygen  toxicity  seizure  and  he  drowned .PERIOD the  reason  i  show  this ,COMMA not  to  put  a  downer  on  everything ,COMMA but  i  just  want  to  use  it  to  key  off  my  philosophy  of  life  in  general ,COMMA which  is  that  we  all  have  two  goals .PERIOD the  first  goal  we  share  with  every  other  living  thing  on  this  planet ,COMMA which  is  to  survive .PERIOD i  call  it  perpetuation: .PERIOD the  survival  of  the  species  and  survival  of  ourselves ,COMMA because  they  're  both  about  perpetuating  the  genome .PERIOD and  the  second  goal ,COMMA for  those  of  us  who  have  mastered  that  first  goal ,COMMA is  to ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  call  it  spiritual  fulfillment ,COMMA you  can  call  it  financial  success ,COMMA you  can  call  it  any  number  of  different  things .PERIOD i  call  it  seeking  joy ,COMMA this  pursuit  of  happiness .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  guess  my  theme  on  this  is  this  guy  lived  his  life  to  the  fullest ,COMMA he  absolutely  did .PERIOD you  have  to  balance  those  two  goals .PERIOD if  you  live  your  whole  life  in  fear ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA life  is  a  sexually  transmitted  disease  with  100  percent  mortality .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  cannot  live  your  life  in  fear .PERIOD i  thought  that  was  an  old  one .PERIOD but ,COMMA at  the  same  time  you  do  n't  want  to  get  so  focused  on  rule  number  two ,COMMA or  goal  number  two ,COMMA that  you  neglect  goal  number  one .PERIOD because  once  you  're  dead ,COMMA you  really  cannot  enjoy  anything  after  that .PERIOD i  wish  you  all  the  best  of  luck  in  maintaining  that  balance  in  your  future  endeavors .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  talk  today  about  the  pleasures  of  everyday  life .PERIOD but  i  want  to  begin  with  a  story  of  an  unusual  and  terrible  man .PERIOD this  is  hermann  goering .PERIOD goering  was  hitler  's  second  in  command  in  world  war  ii ,COMMA his  designated  successor .PERIOD and  like  hitler ,COMMA goering  fancied  himself  a  collector  of  art .PERIOD he  went  through  europe ,COMMA through  world  war  ii ,COMMA stealing ,COMMA extorting  and  occasionally  buying  various  paintings  for  his  collection .PERIOD and  what  he  really  wanted  was  something  by  vermeer .PERIOD hitler  had  two  of  them ,COMMA and  he  did  n't  have  any .PERIOD so  he  finally  found  an  art  dealer ,COMMA a  dutch  art  dealer  named  han  van  meegeren ,COMMA who  sold  him  a  wonderful  vermeer  for  the  cost  of  what  would  now  be  10  million  dollars .PERIOD and  it  was  his  favorite  artwork  ever .PERIOD world  war  ii  came  to  an  end ,COMMA and  goering  was  captured ,COMMA tried  at  nuremberg  and  ultimately  sentenced  to  death .PERIOD then  the  allied  forces  went  through  his  collections  and  found  the  paintings  and  went  after  the  people  who  sold  it  to  him .PERIOD and  at  some  point  the  dutch  police  came  into  amsterdam  and  arrested  van  meegeren .PERIOD van  meegeren  was  charged  with  the  crime  of  treason ,COMMA which  is  itself  punishable  by  death .PERIOD six  weeks  into  his  prison  sentence ,COMMA van  meegeren  confessed .PERIOD but  he  did  n't  confess  to  treason .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA i  did  not  sell  a  great  masterpiece  to  that  nazi .PERIOD i  painted  it  myself .PERIOD i  'm  a  forger .PERIOD now  nobody  believed  him .PERIOD and  he  said ,COMMA i  'll  prove  it .PERIOD bring  me  a  canvas  and  some  paint ,COMMA and  i  will  paint  a  vermeer  much  better  than  i  sold  that  disgusting  nazi .PERIOD i  also  need  alcohol  and  morphine ,COMMA because  it  's  the  only  way  i  can  work .PERIOD so  they  brought  him  in .PERIOD he  painted  a  beautiful  vermeer .PERIOD and  then  the  charges  of  treason  were  dropped .PERIOD he  had  a  lesser  charge  of  forgery ,COMMA got  a  year  sentence  and  died  a  hero  to  the  dutch  people .PERIOD there  's  a  lot  more  to  be  said  about  van  meegeren ,COMMA but  i  want  to  turn  now  to  goering ,COMMA who  's  pictured  here  being  interrogated  at  nuremberg .PERIOD now  goering  was ,COMMA by  all  accounts ,COMMA a  terrible  man .PERIOD even  for  a  nazi ,COMMA he  was  a  terrible  man .PERIOD his  american  interrogators  described  him  as  an  amicable  psychopath .PERIOD but  you  could  feel  sympathy  for  the  reaction  he  had  when  he  was  told  that  his  favorite  painting  was  actually  a  forgery .PERIOD according  to  his  biographer ,COMMA he  looked  as  if  for  the  first  time  he  had  discovered  there  was  evil  in  the  world .PERIOD and  he  killed  himself  soon  afterwards .PERIOD he  had  discovered  after  all  that  the  painting  he  thought  was  this  was  actually  that .PERIOD it  looked  the  same ,COMMA but  it  had  a  different  origin ,COMMA it  was  a  different  artwork .PERIOD it  was  n't  just  him  who  was  in  for  a  shock .PERIOD once  van  meegeren  was  on  trial ,COMMA he  could  n't  stop  talking .PERIOD and  he  boasted  about  all  the  great  masterpieces  that  he  himself  had  painted  that  were  attributed  to  other  artists .PERIOD in  particular ,COMMA the  supper  at  emmaus  which  was  viewed  as  vermeer  's  finest  masterpiece ,COMMA his  best  work ,COMMA people  would  come  from  all  over  the  world  to  see  it ,COMMA was  actually  a  forgery .PERIOD it  was  not  that  painting ,COMMA but  that  painting .PERIOD and  when  that  was  discovered ,COMMA it  lost  all  its  value  and  was  taken  away  from  the  museum .PERIOD why  does  this  matter ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  a  psychologists ,COMMA why  do  origins  matter  so  much ?QUESTIONMARK why  do  we  respond  so  much  to  our  knowledge  of  where  something  comes  from ?QUESTIONMARK well  there  's  an  answer  that  many  people  would  give .PERIOD many  sociologists  like  veblen  and  wolfe  would  argue  that  the  reason  why  we  take  origins  so  seriously  is  because  we  're  snobs ,COMMA because  we  're  focused  on  status .PERIOD among  other  things ,COMMA if  you  want  to  show  off  how  rich  you  are ,COMMA how  powerful  you  are ,COMMA it  's  always  better  to  own  an  original  than  a  forgery  because  there  's  always  going  to  be  fewer  originals  than  forgeries .PERIOD i  do  n't  doubt  that  that  plays  some  role ,COMMA but  what  i  want  to  convince  you  of  today  is  that  there  's  something  else  going  on .PERIOD i  want  to  convince  you  that  humans  are ,COMMA to  some  extent ,COMMA natural  born  essentialists .PERIOD what  i  mean  by  this  is  we  do  n't  just  respond  to  things  as  we  see  them ,COMMA or  feel  them ,COMMA or  hear  them .PERIOD rather ,COMMA our  response  is  conditioned  on  our  beliefs ,COMMA about  what  they  really  are ,COMMA what  they  came  from ,COMMA what  they  're  made  of ,COMMA what  their  hidden  nature  is .PERIOD i  want  to  suggest  that  this  is  true ,COMMA not  just  for  how  we  think  about  things ,COMMA but  how  we  react  to  things .PERIOD so  i  want  to  suggest  that  pleasure  is  deep ,COMMA and  that  this  is  n't  true  just  for  higher  level  pleasures  like  art ,COMMA but  even  the  most  seemingly  simple  pleasures  are  affected  by  our  beliefs  about  hidden  essences .PERIOD so  take  food .PERIOD would  you  eat  this ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA a  good  answer  is ,COMMA it  depends .PERIOD what  is  it ?QUESTIONMARK some  of  you  would  eat  it  if  it  's  pork ,COMMA but  not  beef .PERIOD some  of  you  would  eat  it  if  it  's  beef ,COMMA but  not  pork .PERIOD few  of  you  would  eat  it  if  it  's  a  rat  or  a  human .PERIOD some  of  you  would  eat  it  only  if  it  's  a  strangely  colored  piece  of  tofu .PERIOD that  's  not  so  surprising .PERIOD but  what  's  more  interesting  is  how  it  tastes  to  you  will  depend  critically  on  what  you  think  you  're  eating .PERIOD so  one  demonstration  of  this  was  done  with  young  children .PERIOD how  do  you  make  children  not  just  be  more  likely  to  eat  carrots  and  drink  milk ,COMMA but  to  get  more  pleasure  from  eating  carrots  and  drinking  milk ,COMMA to  think  they  taste  better ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  simple ,COMMA you  tell  them  they  're  from  mcdonald  's .PERIOD they  believe  mcdonald  's  food  is  tastier ,COMMA and  it  leads  them  to  experience  it  as  tastier .PERIOD how  do  you  get  adults  to  really  enjoy  wine ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  very  simple ,COMMA pour  it  from  an  expensive  bottle .PERIOD there  are  now  dozens ,COMMA perhaps  hundreds  of  studies  showing  that  if  you  believe  you  're  drinking  the  expensive  stuff ,COMMA it  tastes  better  to  you .PERIOD this  was  recently  done  with  a  neuroscientific  twist .PERIOD they  get  people  into  a  fmri  scanner ,COMMA and  while  they  're  lying  there ,COMMA through  a  tube ,COMMA they  get  to  sip  wine .PERIOD in  front  of  them  on  a  screen  is  information  about  the  wine .PERIOD everybody ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA drinks  exactly  the  same  wine .PERIOD but  if  you  believe  you  're  drinking  expensive  stuff ,COMMA parts  of  the  brain  associated  with  pleasure  and  reward  light  up  like  a  christmas  tree .PERIOD it  's  not  just  that  you  say  it  's  more  pleasurable ,COMMA you  say  you  like  it  more ,COMMA you  really  experience  it  in  a  different  way .PERIOD or  take  sex .PERIOD these  are  stimuli  i've  used  in  some  of  my  studies .PERIOD and  if  you  simply  show  people  these  pictures ,COMMA they  'll  say  these  are  fairly  attractive  people .PERIOD but  how  attractive  you  find  them ,COMMA how  sexually  or  romantically  moved  you  are  by  them ,COMMA rests  critically  on  who  you  think  you  're  looking  at .PERIOD you  probably  think  the  picture  on  the  left  is  male ,COMMA the  one  on  the  right  is  female .PERIOD if  that  belief  turns  out  to  be  mistaken ,COMMA it  will  make  a  difference .PERIOD it  will  make  a  difference  if  they  turn  out  to  be  much  younger  or  much  older  than  you  think  they  are .PERIOD it  will  make  a  difference  if  you  were  to  discover  that  the  person  you  're  looking  at  with  lust  is  actually  a  disguised  version  of  your  son  or  daughter ,COMMA your  mother  or  father .PERIOD knowing  somebody  's  your  kin  typically  kills  the  libido .PERIOD maybe  one  of  the  most  heartening  findings  from  the  psychology  of  pleasure  is  there  's  more  to  looking  good  than  your  physical  appearance .PERIOD if  you  like  somebody ,COMMA they  look  better  to  you .PERIOD this  is  why  spouses  in  happy  marriages  tend  to  think  that  their  husband  or  wife  looks  much  better  than  anyone  else  thinks  that  they  do .PERIOD a  particularly  dramatic  example  of  this  comes  from  a  neurological  disorder  known  as  capgras  syndrome .PERIOD so  capgras  syndrome  is  a  disorder  where  you  get  a  specific  delusion .PERIOD sufferers  of  capgras  syndrome  believe  that  the  people  they  love  most  in  the  world  have  been  replaced  by  perfect  duplicates .PERIOD now  often ,COMMA a  result  of  capgras  syndrome  is  tragic .PERIOD people  have  murdered  those  that  they  loved ,COMMA believing  that  they  were  murdering  an  imposter .PERIOD but  there  's  at  least  one  case  where  capgras  syndrome  had  a  happy  ending .PERIOD this  was  recorded  in  1931 .PERIOD research  described  a  woman  with  capgras  syndrome  who  complained  about  her  poorly  endowed  and  sexually  inadequate  lover .PERIOD but  that  was  before  she  got  capgras  syndrome .PERIOD after  she  got  it ,COMMA she  was  happy  to  report  that  she  has  discovered  that  he  possessed  a  double  who  was  rich ,COMMA virile ,COMMA handsome  and  aristocratic .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA it  was  the  same  man ,COMMA but  she  was  seeing  him  in  different  ways .PERIOD as  a  third  example ,COMMA consider  consumer  products .PERIOD so  one  reason  why  you  might  like  something  is  its  utility .PERIOD you  can  put  shoes  on  your  feet .PERIOD you  can  play  golf  with  golf  clubs .PERIOD and  chewed  up  bubble  gum  does  n't  do  anything  at  all  for  you .PERIOD but  each  of  these  three  objects  has  value  above  and  beyond  what  it  can  do  for  you  based  on  its  history .PERIOD the  golf  clubs  were  owned  by  john  f .PERIOD kennedy  and  sold  for  three-quarters  of  a  million  dollars  at  auction .PERIOD the  bubble  gum  was  chewed  up  by  pop  star  britney  spears  and  sold  for  several  hundreds  of  dollars .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA there  's  a  thriving  market  in  the  partially  eaten  food  of  beloved  people .PERIOD the  shoes  are  perhaps  the  most  valuable  of  all .PERIOD according  to  an  unconfirmed  report ,COMMA a  saudi  millionaire  offered  10  million  dollars  for  this  pair  of  shoes .PERIOD they  were  the  ones  thrown  at  george  bush  at  an  iraqi  press  conference  several  years  ago .PERIOD now  this  attraction  to  objects  does  n't  just  work  for  celebrity  objects .PERIOD each  one  of  us ,COMMA most  people ,COMMA have  something  in  our  life  that  's  literally  irreplaceable ,COMMA in  that  it  has  value  because  of  its  history ,COMMA maybe  your  wedding  ring ,COMMA maybe  your  child  's  baby  shoes ,COMMA so  that  if  it  was  lost ,COMMA you  could  n't  get  it  back .PERIOD you  could  get  something  that  looked  like  it  or  felt  like  it ,COMMA but  you  could  n't  get  the  same  object  back .PERIOD with  my  colleagues  george  newman  and  gil  diesendruck ,COMMA we've  looked  to  see  what  sort  of  factors ,COMMA what  sort  of  history ,COMMA matters  for  the  objects  that  people  like .PERIOD so  in  one  of  our  experiments ,COMMA we  asked  people  to  name  a  famous  person  who  they  adored ,COMMA a  living  person  they  adored .PERIOD so  one  answer  was  george  clooney .PERIOD then  we  asked  them ,COMMA how  much  would  you  pay  for  george  clooney  's  sweater ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  answer  is  a  fair  amount ,COMMA more  than  you  would  pay  for  a  brand  new  sweater  or  a  sweater  owned  by  somebody  who  you  did  n't  adore .PERIOD then  we  asked  other  groups  of  subjects ,COMMA we  gave  them  different  restrictions  and  different  conditions .PERIOD so  for  instance ,COMMA we  told  some  people ,COMMA look ,COMMA you  can  buy  the  sweater ,COMMA but  you  cannot  tell  anybody  you  own  it ,COMMA and  you  cannot  resell  it .PERIOD that  drops  the  value  of  it ,COMMA suggesting  that  that  's  one  reason  why  we  like  it .PERIOD but  what  really  causes  an  effect  is  you  tell  people ,COMMA look ,COMMA you  could  resell  it ,COMMA you  could  boast  about  it ,COMMA but  before  it  gets  to  you ,COMMA it  's  thoroughly  washed .PERIOD that  causes  a  huge  drop  in  the  value .PERIOD as  my  wife  put  it ,COMMA you've  washed  away  the  clooney  cooties .PERIOD so  let  's  go  back  to  art .PERIOD i  would  love  a  chagall .PERIOD i  love  the  work  of  chagall .PERIOD if  people  want  to  get  me  something  at  the  end  of  the  conference ,COMMA you  could  buy  me  a  chagall .PERIOD but  i  do  n't  want  a  duplicate ,COMMA even  if  i  cannot  tell  the  difference .PERIOD that  's  not  because ,COMMA or  it  's  not  simply  because ,COMMA i  'm  a  snob  and  want  to  boast  about  having  an  original .PERIOD rather ,COMMA it  's  because  i  want  something  that  has  a  specific  history .PERIOD in  the  case  of  artwork ,COMMA the  history  is  special  indeed .PERIOD the  philosopher  denis  dutton  in  his  wonderful  book  the  art  instinct  makes  the  case  that ,COMMA the  value  of  an  artwork  is  rooted  in  assumptions  about  the  human  performance  underlying  its  creation .PERIOD and  that  could  explain  the  difference  between  an  original  and  a  forgery .PERIOD they  may  look  alike ,COMMA but  they  have  a  different  history .PERIOD the  original  is  typically  the  product  of  a  creative  act ,COMMA the  forgery  is  n't .PERIOD i  think  this  approach  can  explain  differences  in  people  's  taste  in  art .PERIOD this  is  a  work  by  jackson  pollock .PERIOD who  here  likes  the  work  of  jackson  pollock ?QUESTIONMARK okay .PERIOD who  here ,COMMA it  does  nothing  for  them ?QUESTIONMARK they  just  do  n't  like  it .PERIOD i  'm  not  going  to  make  a  claim  about  who  's  right ,COMMA but  i  will  make  an  empirical  claim  about  people  's  intuitions ,COMMA which  is  that ,COMMA if  you  like  the  work  of  jackson  pollock ,COMMA you  'll  tend  more  so  than  the  people  who  do  n't  like  it  to  believe  that  these  works  are  difficult  to  create ,COMMA that  they  require  a  lot  of  time  and  energy  and  creative  energy .PERIOD i  use  jackson  pollock  on  purpose  as  an  example  because  there  's  a  young  american  artist  who  paints  very  much  in  the  style  of  jackson  pollock ,COMMA and  her  work  was  worth  many  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars ,COMMA in  large  part  because  she  's  a  very  young  artist .PERIOD this  is  marla  olmstead  who  did  most  of  her  work  when  she  was  three  years  old .PERIOD the  interesting  thing  about  marla  olmstead  is  her  family  made  the  mistake  of  inviting  the  television  program  60  minutes  ii  into  their  house  to  film  her  painting .PERIOD and  they  then  reported  that  her  father  was  coaching  her .PERIOD when  this  came  out  on  television ,COMMA the  value  of  her  art  dropped  to  nothing .PERIOD it  was  the  same  art ,COMMA physically ,COMMA but  the  history  had  changed .PERIOD i've  been  focusing  now  on  the  visual  arts ,COMMA but  i  want  to  give  two  examples  from  music .PERIOD this  is  joshua  bell ,COMMA a  very  famous  violinist .PERIOD and  the  washington  post  reporter  gene  weingarten  decided  to  enlist  him  for  an  audacious  experiment .PERIOD the  question  is ,COMMA how  much  would  people  like  joshua  bell ,COMMA the  music  of  joshua  bell ,COMMA if  they  did  n't  know  they  were  listening  to  joshua  bell ?QUESTIONMARK so  he  got  joshua  bell  to  take  his  million  dollar  violin  down  to  a  washington  dc .PERIOD subway  station  and  stand  in  the  corner  and  see  how  much  money  he  would  make .PERIOD and  here  's  a  brief  clip  of  this .PERIOD after  being  there  for  three-quarters  of  an  hour ,COMMA he  made  32  dollars .PERIOD not  bad .PERIOD it  's  also  not  good .PERIOD apparently  to  really  enjoy  the  music  of  joshua  bell ,COMMA you  have  to  know  you  're  listening  to  joshua  bell .PERIOD he  actually  made  20  dollars  more  than  that ,COMMA but  he  did  n't  count  it .PERIOD because  this  woman  comes  up ,COMMA you  see  at  the  end  of  the  video ,COMMA she  comes  up .PERIOD she  had  heard  him  at  the  library  of  congress  a  few  weeks  before  at  this  extravagant  black-tie  affair .PERIOD so  she  's  stunned  that  he  's  standing  in  a  subway  station .PERIOD so  she  's  struck  with  pity .PERIOD she  reaches  into  her  purse  and  hands  him  a  20 .PERIOD the  second  example  from  music  is  from  john  cage  's  modernist  composition ,COMMA 4'33 .PERIOD as  many  of  you  know ,COMMA this  is  the  composition  where  the  pianist  sits  at  a  bench ,COMMA opens  up  the  piano  and  sits  and  does  nothing  for  four  minutes  and  33  seconds ,COMMA that  period  of  silence .PERIOD and  people  have  different  views  on  this .PERIOD but  what  i  want  to  point  out  is  you  can  buy  this  from  itunes .PERIOD for  a  dollar  99 ,COMMA you  can  listen  to  that  silence ,COMMA which  is  different  than  other  forms  of  silence .PERIOD now  i've  been  talking  so  far  about  pleasure ,COMMA but  what  i  want  to  suggest  is  that  everything  i've  said  applies  as  well  to  pain .PERIOD and  how  you  think  about  what  you  're  experiencing ,COMMA your  beliefs  about  the  essence  of  it ,COMMA affect  how  it  hurts .PERIOD one  lovely  experiment  was  done  by  kurt  gray  and  dan  wegner .PERIOD what  they  did  was  they  hooked  up  harvard  undergraduates  to  an  electric  shock  machine .PERIOD and  they  gave  them  a  series  of  painful  electric  shocks .PERIOD so  it  was  a  series  of  five  painful  shocks .PERIOD half  of  them  are  told  that  they  're  being  given  the  shocks  by  somebody  in  another  room ,COMMA but  the  person  in  the  other  room  does  n't  know  they  're  giving  them  shocks .PERIOD there  's  no  malevolence ,COMMA they  're  just  pressing  a  button .PERIOD the  first  shock  is  recorded  as  very  painful .PERIOD the  second  shock  feels  less  painful ,COMMA because  you  get  a  bit  used  to  it .PERIOD the  third  drops ,COMMA the  fourth ,COMMA the  fifth .PERIOD the  pain  gets  less .PERIOD in  the  other  condition ,COMMA they  're  told  that  the  person  in  the  next  room  is  shocking  them  on  purpose ,COMMA knows  they  're  shocking  them .PERIOD the  first  shock  hurts  like  hell .PERIOD the  second  shock  hurts  just  as  much ,COMMA and  the  third  and  the  fourth  and  the  fifth .PERIOD it  hurts  more  if  you  believe  somebody  is  doing  it  to  you  on  purpose .PERIOD the  most  extreme  example  of  this  is  that  in  some  cases ,COMMA pain  under  the  right  circumstances  can  transform  into  pleasure .PERIOD humans  have  this  extraordinarily  interesting  property  that  will  often  seek  out  low-level  doses  of  pain  in  controlled  circumstances  and  take  pleasure  from  it ,COMMA as  in  the  eating  of  hot  chili  peppers  and  roller  coaster  rides .PERIOD the  point  was  nicely  summarized  by  the  poet  john  milton  who  wrote ,COMMA the  mind  is  its  own  place ,COMMA and  in  itself  can  make  a  heaven  of  hell ,COMMA a  hell  of  heaven .PERIOD and  i  'll  end  with  that .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD it  is  a  thrill  to  be  here  at  a  conference  that  's  devoted  to  inspired  by  nature ,COMMA you  can  imagine .PERIOD and  i  'm  also  thrilled  to  be  in  the  foreplay  section .PERIOD did  you  notice  this  section  is  foreplay ?QUESTIONMARK because  i  get  to  talk  about  one  of  my  favorite  critters ,COMMA which  is  the  western  grebe .PERIOD you  have  n't  lived  until  you've  seen  these  guys  do  their  courtship  dance .PERIOD i  was  on  bowman  lake  in  glacier  national  park ,COMMA which  is  a  long ,COMMA skinny  lake  with  sort  of  mountains  upside  down  in  it ,COMMA and  my  partner  and  i  have  a  rowing  shell .PERIOD and  so  we  were  rowing ,COMMA and  one  of  these  western  grebes  came  along .PERIOD and  what  they  do  for  their  courtship  dance  is ,COMMA they  go  together ,COMMA the  two  of  them ,COMMA the  two  mates ,COMMA and  they  begin  to  run  underwater .PERIOD they  paddle  faster ,COMMA and  faster ,COMMA and  faster ,COMMA until  they  're  going  so  fast  that  they  literally  lift  up  out  of  the  water ,COMMA and  they  're  standing  upright ,COMMA sort  of  paddling  the  top  of  the  water .PERIOD and  one  of  these  grebes  came  along  while  we  were  rowing .PERIOD and  so  we  're  in  a  skull ,COMMA and  we  're  moving  really ,COMMA really  quickly .PERIOD and  this  grebe ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA sort  of ,COMMA mistaked  us  for  a  prospect ,COMMA and  started  to  run  along  the  water  next  to  us ,COMMA in  a  courtship  dance ,COMMA for  miles .PERIOD it  would  stop ,COMMA and  then  start ,COMMA and  then  stop ,COMMA and  then  start .PERIOD now  that  is  foreplay .PERIOD i  came  this  close  to  changing  species  at  that  moment .PERIOD obviously ,COMMA life  can  teach  us  something  in  the  entertainment  section .PERIOD life  has  a  lot  to  teach  us .PERIOD but  what  i'd  like  to  talk  about  today  is  what  life  might  teach  us  in  technology  and  in  design .PERIOD what  's  happened  since  the  book  came  out ,COMMA the  book  was  mainly  about  research  in  biomimicry  -- .PERIOD and  what  's  happened  since  then  is  architects ,COMMA designers ,COMMA engineers ,COMMA people  who  make  our  world ,COMMA have  started  to  call  and  say ,COMMA we  want  a  biologist  to  sit  at  the  design  table  to  help  us ,COMMA in  real  time ,COMMA become  inspired .PERIOD or ,COMMA and  this  is  the  fun  part  for  me ,COMMA we  want  you  to  take  us  out  into  the  natural  world .PERIOD we  'll  come  with  a  design  challenge  and  we  find  the  champion  adapters  in  the  natural  world ,COMMA who  might  inspire  us .PERIOD so  this  is  a  picture  from  a  galapagos  trip  that  we  took  with  some  wastewater  treatment  engineers .PERIOD they  purify  wastewater .PERIOD and  some  of  them  were  very  resistant ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to  being  there .PERIOD what  they  said  to  us  at  first  was ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA we  already  do  biomimicry .PERIOD we  use  bacteria  to  clean  our  water .PERIOD and  we  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA that  's  not  exactly  being  inspired  by  nature .PERIOD that  's  bioprocessing ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD that  's  bio-assisted  technology ,COMMA using  an  organism  to  do  your  wastewater  treatment  is  an  old ,COMMA old  technology  called  domestication .PERIOD this  is  learning  something ,COMMA learning  an  idea ,COMMA from  an  organism  and  then  applying  it .PERIOD and  so  they  still  were  n't  getting  it .PERIOD so  we  went  for  a  walk  on  the  beach  and  i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA give  me  one  of  your  big  problems .PERIOD give  me  a  design  challenge ,COMMA sustainability  speed  bump ,COMMA that  's  keeping  you  from  being  sustainable .PERIOD and  they  said  scaling ,COMMA which  is  the  build-up  of  minerals  inside  of  pipes .PERIOD and  they  said ,COMMA you  know  what  happens  is ,COMMA mineral ,COMMA just  like  at  your  house ,COMMA mineral  builds  up .PERIOD and  then  the  aperture  closes ,COMMA and  we  have  to  flush  the  pipes  with  toxins ,COMMA or  we  have  to  dig  them  up .PERIOD so  if  we  had  some  way  to  stop  this  scaling ,COMMA and  so  i  picked  up  some  shells  on  the  beach .PERIOD and  i  asked  them ,COMMA what  is  scaling ?QUESTIONMARK what  's  inside  your  pipes ?QUESTIONMARK and  they  said ,COMMA calcium  carbonate .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA that  's  what  this  is .PERIOD this  is  calcium  carbonate .PERIOD and  they  did  n't  know  that .PERIOD they  did  n't  know  that  what  a  seashell  is ,COMMA it  's  templated  by  proteins ,COMMA and  then  ions  from  the  seawater  crystallize  in  place  to  create  a  shell .PERIOD so  the  same  sort  of  a  process ,COMMA without  the  proteins ,COMMA is  happening  on  the  inside  of  their  pipes .PERIOD they  did  n't  know .PERIOD this  is  not  for  lack  of  information .PERIOD it  's  a  lack  of  integration .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA it  's  a  silo ,COMMA people  in  silos .PERIOD they  did  n't  know  that  the  same  thing  was  happening .PERIOD so  one  of  them  thought  about  it  and  said ,COMMA ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA if  this  is  just  crystallization  that  happens  automatically  out  of  seawater ,COMMA self-assembly ,COMMA then  why  are  n't  shells  infinite  in  size ?QUESTIONMARK what  stops  the  scaling ?QUESTIONMARK why  do  n't  they  just  keep  on  going ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA in  the  same  way  that  they  exude  a  protein  and  it  starts  the  crystallization ,COMMA and  then  they  all  sort  of  leaned  in ,COMMA they  let  go  of  a  protein  that  stops  the  crystallization .PERIOD it  literally  adheres  to  the  growing  face  of  the  crystal .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA there  is  a  product  called  tpa  that  's  mimicked  that  protein ,COMMA that  stop-protein ,COMMA and  it  's  an  environmentally  friendly  way  to  stop  scaling  in  pipes .PERIOD that  changed  everything .PERIOD from  then  on ,COMMA you  could  not  get  these  engineers  back  in  the  boat .PERIOD the  first  day  they  would  take  a  hike ,COMMA and  it  was ,COMMA click ,COMMA click ,COMMA click ,COMMA click .PERIOD five  minutes  later  they  were  back  in  the  boat .PERIOD we  're  done .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA i've  seen  that  island .PERIOD after  this ,COMMA they  were  crawling  all  over .PERIOD they  would  snorkel  for  as  long  as  we  would  let  them  snorkel .PERIOD what  had  happened  was  that  they  realized  that  there  were  organisms  out  there  that  had  already  solved  the  problems  that  they  had  spent  their  careers  trying  to  solve .PERIOD learning  about  the  natural  world  is  one  thing .PERIOD learning  from  the  natural  world ,COMMA that  's  the  switch .PERIOD that  's  the  profound  switch .PERIOD what  they  realized  was  that  the  answers  to  their  questions  are  everywhere .PERIOD they  just  needed  to  change  the  lenses  with  which  they  saw  the  world .PERIOD 38  billion  years  of  field-testing .PERIOD 10  to  30 ,COMMA craig  venter  will  probably  tell  you .PERIOD i  think  there  's  a  lot  more  than  30  million ,COMMA well-adapted  solutions .PERIOD the  important  thing  for  me  is  that  these  are  solutions  solved  in  context .PERIOD and  the  context  is  the  earth ,COMMA the  same  context  that  we  're  trying  to  solve  our  problems  in .PERIOD so  it  's  the  conscious  emulation  of  life  's  genius .PERIOD it  's  not  slavishly  mimicking ,COMMA although  al  is  trying  to  get  the  hairdo  going ,COMMA it  's  not  a  slavish  mimicry .PERIOD it  's  taking  the  design  principles ,COMMA the  genius  of  the  natural  world ,COMMA and  learning  something  from  it .PERIOD now ,COMMA in  a  group  with  so  many  it  people ,COMMA i  do  have  to  mention  what  i  'm  not  going  to  talk  about ,COMMA and  that  is  that  your  field  is  one  that  has  learned  an  enormous  amount  from  living  things ,COMMA on  the  software  side .PERIOD so  there  's  computers  that  protect  themselves ,COMMA like  an  immune  system ,COMMA and  we  're  learning  from  gene  regulation  and  biological  development .PERIOD and  we  're  learning  from  neural  nets ,COMMA genetic  algorithms ,COMMA evolutionary  computing .PERIOD that  's  on  the  software  side .PERIOD but  what  's  interesting  to  me  is  that  we  have  n't  looked  at  this ,COMMA as  much .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA these  machines  are  really  not  very  high  tech  in  my  estimation  in  the  sense  that  there  's  dozens  and  dozens  of  carcinogens  in  the  water  in  silicon  valley .PERIOD so  the  hardware  is  not  at  all  up  to  snuff  in  terms  of  what  life  would  call  a  success .PERIOD so  what  can  we  learn  about  making ,COMMA not  just  computers ,COMMA but  everything ?QUESTIONMARK the  plane  you  came  in ,COMMA cars ,COMMA the  seats  that  you  're  sitting  on .PERIOD how  do  we  redesign  the  world  that  we  make ,COMMA the  human-made  world ?QUESTIONMARK more  importantly ,COMMA what  should  we  ask  in  the  next  10  years ?QUESTIONMARK and  there  's  a  lot  of  cool  technologies  out  there  that  life  has .PERIOD what  's  the  syllabus ?QUESTIONMARK three  questions ,COMMA for  me ,COMMA are  key .PERIOD how  does  life  make  things ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  the  opposite .PERIOD this  is  how  we  make  things .PERIOD it  's  called  heat ,COMMA beat  and  treat ,COMMA that  's  what  material  scientists  call  it .PERIOD and  it  's  carving  things  down  from  the  top ,COMMA with  96  percent  waste  left  over  and  only  4  percent  product .PERIOD you  heat  it  up .PERIOD you  beat  it  with  high  pressures .PERIOD you  use  chemicals .PERIOD ok .PERIOD heat ,COMMA beat  and  treat .PERIOD life  cannot  afford  to  do  that .PERIOD how  does  life  make  things ?QUESTIONMARK how  does  life  make  the  most  of  things ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  a  geranium  pollen .PERIOD and  its  shape  is  what  gives  it  the  function  of  being  able  to  tumble  through  air  so  easily .PERIOD look  at  that  shape .PERIOD life  adds  information  to  matter .PERIOD in  other  words ,COMMA structure .PERIOD it  gives  it  information .PERIOD by  adding  information  to  matter ,COMMA it  gives  it  a  function  that  's  different  than  without  that  structure .PERIOD and  thirdly ,COMMA how  does  life  make  things  disappear  into  systems ?QUESTIONMARK because  life  does  n't  really  deal  in  things .PERIOD there  are  no  things  in  the  natural  world  divorced  from  their  systems .PERIOD really  quick  syllabus .PERIOD as  i  'm  reading  more  and  more  now ,COMMA and  following  the  story ,COMMA there  are  some  amazing  things  coming  up  in  the  biological  sciences .PERIOD and  at  the  same  time ,COMMA i  'm  listening  to  a  lot  of  businesses  and  finding  what  their  sort  of  grand  challenges  are .PERIOD the  two  groups  are  not  talking  to  each  other .PERIOD at  all .PERIOD what  in  the  world  of  biology  might  be  helpful  at  this  juncture ,COMMA to  get  us  through  this  sort  of  evolutionary  knothole  that  we  're  in ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  going  to  try  to  go  through  12 ,COMMA really  quickly .PERIOD one  that  's  exciting  to  me  is  self-assembly .PERIOD now ,COMMA you've  heard  about  this  in  terms  of  nanotechnology .PERIOD back  to  that  shell ,COMMA the  shell  is  a  self-assembling  material .PERIOD on  the  lower  left  there  is  a  picture  of  mother  of  pearl  forming  out  of  seawater .PERIOD it  's  a  layered  structure  that  's  mineral  and  then  polymer ,COMMA and  it  makes  it  very ,COMMA very  tough .PERIOD it  's  twice  as  tough  as  our  high-tech  ceramics .PERIOD but  what  's  really  interesting ,COMMA unlike  our  ceramics  that  are  in  kilns ,COMMA it  happens  in  seawater .PERIOD it  happens  near ,COMMA in  and  near ,COMMA the  organism  's  body .PERIOD this  is  sandia  national  labs .PERIOD a  guy  named  jeff  brinker  has  found  a  way  to  have  a  self-assembling  coding  process .PERIOD imagine  being  able  to  make  ceramics  at  room  temperature  by  simply  dipping  something  into  a  liquid ,COMMA lifting  it  out  of  the  liquid ,COMMA and  having  evaporation  force  the  molecules  in  the  liquid  together ,COMMA so  that  they  jigsaw  together  in  the  same  way  as  this  crystallization  works .PERIOD imagine  making  all  of  our  hard  materials  that  way .PERIOD imagine  spraying  the  precursors  to  a  pv  cell ,COMMA to  a  solar  cell ,COMMA onto  a  roof ,COMMA and  having  it  self-assemble  into  a  layered  structure  that  harvests  light .PERIOD here  's  an  interesting  one  for  the  it  world ,COMMA bio-silicon .PERIOD this  is  a  diatom ,COMMA which  is  made  of  silicates .PERIOD and  so  silicon ,COMMA which  we  make  right  now ,COMMA it  's  part  of  our  carcinogenic  problem  in  the  manufacture  of  our  chips ,COMMA this  is  a  bio-mineralization  process  that  's  now  being  mimicked .PERIOD this  is  at  uc  santa  barbara .PERIOD look  at  these  diatoms .PERIOD this  is  from  ernst  haeckel  's  work .PERIOD imagine  being  able  to ,COMMA and ,COMMA again ,COMMA it  's  a  templated  process ,COMMA and  it  solidifies  out  of  a  liquid  process ,COMMA imagine  being  able  to  have  that  sort  of  structure  coming  out  at  room  temperature .PERIOD imagine  being  able  to  make  perfect  lenses .PERIOD on  the  left ,COMMA this  is  a  brittle  star .PERIOD it  's  covered  with  lenses

them ,COMMA all  over  its  entire  body .PERIOD what  's  interesting ,COMMA again ,COMMA is  that  it  self-assembles .PERIOD a  woman  named  joanna  aizenberg ,COMMA at  lucent ,COMMA is  now  learning  to  do  this  in  a  low-temperature  process  to  create  these  sort  of  lenses .PERIOD she  's  also  looking  at  fiber  optics .PERIOD that  's  a  sea  sponge  that  has  a  fiber  optic .PERIOD down  at  the  very  base  of  it ,COMMA there  's  fiber  optics  that  work  better  than  ours ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to  move  light .PERIOD but  you  can  tie  them  in  a  knot .PERIOD they  're  incredibly  flexible .PERIOD here  's  another  big  idea ,COMMA co2  as  a  feedstock .PERIOD a  guy  named  geoff  coates ,COMMA at  cornell ,COMMA said  to  himself ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA plants  do  not  see  co2  as  the  biggest  poison  of  our  time .PERIOD we  see  it  that  way .PERIOD plants  are  busy  making  long  chains  of  starches  and  glucose ,COMMA right ,COMMA out  of  co2 .PERIOD he  's  found  a  way ,COMMA he  's  found  a  catalyst ,COMMA and  he  's  found  a  way  to  take  co2  and  make  it  into  polycarbonates .PERIOD biodegradable

 purple  bacterium ,COMMA the  people  at  asu .PERIOD even  more  interesting ,COMMA lately ,COMMA in  the  last  couple  of  weeks ,COMMA people  have  seen  that  there  's  an  enzyme  called  hydrogenase  that  's  able  to  evolve  hydrogen  from  proton  and  electrons ,COMMA and  is  able  to  take  hydrogen  up ,COMMA basically  what  's  happening  in  a  fuel  cell ,COMMA in  the  anode  of  a  fuel  cell  and  in  a  reversible  fuel  cell .PERIOD in  our  fuel  cells ,COMMA we  do  it  with  platinum .PERIOD life  does  it  with  a  very ,COMMA very  common  iron .PERIOD and  a  team  has  now  just  been  able  to  mimic  that  hydrogen-juggling  hydrogenase .PERIOD that  's  very  exciting  for  fuel  cells ,COMMA to  be  able  to  do  that  without  platinum .PERIOD power  of  shape ,COMMA here  's  a  whale .PERIOD we've  seen  that  the  fins  of  this  whale  have  tubercles  on  them .PERIOD and  those  little  bumps  actually  increase  efficiency  in ,COMMA

amount  of  headline  as  all  the  other  ones  you've  seen .PERIOD what  's  unusual  about  this  one ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA is  that  it  's  from  1953 .PERIOD and  the  reason  i  'm  saying  this  is  that  you  may  have  the  idea  this  problem  is  relatively  recent .PERIOD that  people  have  just  sort  of  figured  out  about  it ,COMMA and  now  with  kyoto  and  the  governator  and  people  beginning  to  actually  do  something ,COMMA we  may  be  on  the  road  to  a  solution .PERIOD the  fact  is ,COMMA uh-uh .PERIOD we've  known  about  this  problem  for  50  years ,COMMA depending  on  how  you  count  it .PERIOD we  have  talked  about  it  endlessly  over  the  last  decade  or  so .PERIOD and  we've  accomplished  close  to  zip .PERIOD this  is  the  growth  rate  of  co2  in  the  atmosphere .PERIOD you've  seen  this  in  various  forms ,COMMA but  maybe  you  have  n't  seen  this  one .PERIOD what  this  shows  is  that  the  rate  of  growth  of  our  emissions  is  accelerating .PERIOD and  that  it  's  accelerating  even  faster  than  what  we  thought  was  the  worst  case  just  a  few  years  back .PERIOD so  that  red  line  there  was  something  that  a  lot  of  skeptics  said  the  environmentalists  only  put  in  the  projections  to  make  the  projections  look  as  bad  as  possible .PERIOD that  emissions  would  never  grow  as  fast  as  that  red  line .PERIOD but  in  fact ,COMMA they  're  growing  faster .PERIOD here  's  some  data  from  actually  just  10  days  ago ,COMMA which  shows  this  year  's  minimum  of  the  arctic  sea  ice ,COMMA and  it  's  the  lowest  by  far .PERIOD and  the  rate  at  which  the  arctic  sea  ice  is  going  away  is  a  lot  quicker  than  models .PERIOD so  despite  all  sorts  of  experts  like  me  flying  around  the  planet  and  burning  jet  fuel ,COMMA and  politicians  signing  treaties ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA you  could  argue  the  net  effect  of  all  this  has  been  negative ,COMMA because  it  's  just  consumed  a  lot  of  jet  fuel .PERIOD no ,COMMA no .PERIOD in  terms  of  what  we  really  need  to  do  to  put  the  brakes  on  this  very  high  inertial  thing ,COMMA our  big  economy ,COMMA we've  really  hardly  started .PERIOD really ,COMMA we  're  doing  this ,COMMA basically .PERIOD really ,COMMA not  very  much .PERIOD i  do  n't  want  to  depress  you  too  much .PERIOD the  problem  is  absolutely  soluble ,COMMA and  even  soluble  in  a  way  that  's  reasonably  cheap .PERIOD cheap  meaning  sort  of  the  cost  of  the  military ,COMMA not  the  cost  of  medical  care .PERIOD cheap  meaning  a  few  percent  of  gdp .PERIOD no ,COMMA this  is  really  important  to  have  this  sense  of  scale .PERIOD so  the  problem  is  soluble ,COMMA and  the  way  we  should  go  about  solving  it  is ,COMMA say ,COMMA dealing  with  electricity  production ,COMMA which  causes  something  like  43-or-so  percent  and  rising  of  co2  emissions .PERIOD and  we  could  do  that  by  perfectly  sensible  things  like  conservation ,COMMA and  wind  power ,COMMA nuclear  power  and  coal  to  co2  capture ,COMMA which  are  all  things  that  are  ready  for  giant  scale  deployment ,COMMA and  work .PERIOD all  we  lack  is  the  action  to  actually  spend  the  money  to  put  those  into  place .PERIOD instead ,COMMA we  spend  our  time  talking .PERIOD but  nevertheless ,COMMA that  's  not  what  i  'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  tonight .PERIOD what  i  'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  tonight  is  stuff  we  might  do  if  we  did  nothing .PERIOD and  it  's  this  stuff  in  the  middle  here ,COMMA which  is  what  you  do  if  you  do  n't  stop  the  emissions  quickly  enough .PERIOD and  you  need  to  deal ,COMMA somehow  break  the  link  between  human  actions  that  change  climate ,COMMA and  the  climate  change  itself .PERIOD and  that  's  particularly  important  because ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA while  we  can  adapt  to  climate  change ,COMMA and  it  's  important  to  be  honest  here ,COMMA there  will  be  some  benefits  to  climate  change .PERIOD oh ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i  think  it  's  bad .PERIOD i've  spent  my  whole  life  working  to  stop  it .PERIOD but  one  of  the  reasons  it  's  politically  hard  is  there  are  winners  and  losers ,COMMA not  all  losers .PERIOD but ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA the  natural  world ,COMMA polar  bears .PERIOD i  spent  time  skiing  across  the  sea  ice  for  weeks  at  a  time  in  the  high  arctic .PERIOD they  will  completely  lose .PERIOD and  there  's  no  adaption .PERIOD so  this  problem  is  absolutely  soluble .PERIOD this  geo-engineering  idea ,COMMA in  it  's  simplest  form ,COMMA is  basically  the  following .PERIOD you  could  put  signed  particles ,COMMA say  sulfuric  acid  particles ,COMMA sulfates ,COMMA into  the  upper  atmosphere ,COMMA the  stratosphere ,COMMA where  they'd  reflect  away  sunlight  and  cool  the  planet .PERIOD and  i  know  for  certain  that  that  will  work .PERIOD not  that  there  are  n't  side  effects ,COMMA but  i  know  for  certain  it  will  work .PERIOD and  the  reason  is ,COMMA it  's  been  done .PERIOD and  it  was  done  not  by  us ,COMMA not  by  me ,COMMA but  by  nature .PERIOD here  's  mount  pinatubo  in  the  early  90s .PERIOD that  put  a  whole  bunch  of  sulfur  in  the  stratosphere  with  a  sort  of  atomic  bomb-like  cloud .PERIOD the  result  of  that  was  pretty  dramatic .PERIOD after  that ,COMMA and  some  previous  volcanoes  we  have ,COMMA you  see  a  quite  dramatic  cooling  of  the  atmosphere .PERIOD so  this  lower  bar  is  the  upper  atmosphere ,COMMA the  stratosphere ,COMMA and  it  heats  up  after  these  volcanoes .PERIOD but  you  'll  notice  that  in  the  upper  bar ,COMMA which  is  the  lower  atmosphere  and  the  surface ,COMMA it  cools  down  because  we  shielded  the  atmosphere  a  little  bit .PERIOD there  's  no  big  mystery  about  it .PERIOD there  's  lots  of  mystery  in  the  details ,COMMA and  there  's  some  bad  side  effects ,COMMA like  it  partially  destroys  the  ozone  layer ,COMMA and  i  'll  get  to  that  in  a  minute .PERIOD but  it  clearly  cools  down .PERIOD and  one  other  thing ,COMMA it  's  fast .PERIOD it  's  really  important  to  say .PERIOD so  much  of  the  other  things  that  we  ought  to  do ,COMMA like  slowing  emissions ,COMMA are  intrinsically  slow ,COMMA because  it  takes  time  to  build  all  the  hardware  we  need  to  reduce  emissions .PERIOD and  not  only  that ,COMMA when  you  cut  emissions ,COMMA you  do  n't  cut  concentrations .PERIOD because  concentrations ,COMMA the  amount  of  co2  in  the  air ,COMMA is  the  sum  of  emissions  over  time .PERIOD so  you  cannot  step  on  the  brakes  very  quickly .PERIOD but  if  you  do  this ,COMMA it  's  quick .PERIOD and  there  are  times  you  might  like  to  do  something  quick .PERIOD another  thing  you  might  wonder  about  is ,COMMA does  it  work ?QUESTIONMARK can  you  shade  some  sunlight  and  effectively  compensate  for  the  added  co2 ,COMMA and  produce  a  climate  sort  of  back  to  what  it  was  originally ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  answer  seems  to  be  yes .PERIOD so  here  are  the  graphs  you've  seen  lots  of  times  before .PERIOD that  's  what  the  world  looks  like ,COMMA under  one  particular  climate  model  's  view ,COMMA with  twice  the  amount  of  co2  in  the  air .PERIOD the  lower  graph  is  with  twice  the  amount  of  co2  and  18  percent  less  sunlight ,COMMA and  you  're  back  to  the  original  climate .PERIOD and  this  graph  from  ken  caldeira .PERIOD it  's  important  to  say  came ,COMMA because  ken ,COMMA at  a  meeting  that  i  believe  marty  hoffart  was  also  at  in  the  mid-'90s ,COMMA ken  and  i  stood  up  at  the  back  of  the  meeting  and  said ,COMMA geo-engineering  wo  n't  work .PERIOD and  to  the  person  who  was  promoting  it  said ,COMMA the  atmosphere  's  much  more  complicated .PERIOD gave  a  bunch  of  physical  reasons  why  it  would  n't  do  a  very  good  compensation .PERIOD ken  went  and  ran  his  models ,COMMA and  found  that  it  did .PERIOD this  topic  is  also  old .PERIOD that  report  that  landed  on  president  johnson  's  desk  when  i  was  two  years  old  -- .PERIOD 1965 .PERIOD that  report ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA which  had  all  the  modern  climate  science ,COMMA the  only  thing  they  talked  about  doing  was  geo-engineering .PERIOD it  did  n't  even  talk  about  cutting  emissions ,COMMA which  is  an  incredible  shift  in  our  thinking  about  this  problem .PERIOD i  'm  not  saying  we  should  n't  cut  emissions .PERIOD we  should ,COMMA but  it  made  exactly  this  point .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  a  sense ,COMMA there  's  not  much  new .PERIOD the  one  new  thing  is  this  essay .PERIOD so  i  should  say ,COMMA i  guess ,COMMA that  since  the  time  of  that  original  president  johnson  report ,COMMA and  the  various  reports  of  the  us .PERIOD national  academy ,COMMA 1977 ,COMMA 1982 ,COMMA 1990 ,COMMA people  always  talked  about  this  idea .PERIOD not  as  something  that  was  foolproof ,COMMA but  as  an  idea  to  think  about .PERIOD but  when  climate  became ,COMMA politically ,COMMA a  hot  topic ,COMMA if  i  may  make  the  pun ,COMMA in  the  last  15  years ,COMMA this  became  so  un-pc ,COMMA we  could  n't  talk  about  it .PERIOD it  just  sunk  below  the  surface .PERIOD we  were  n't  allowed  to  speak  about  it .PERIOD but  in  the  last  year ,COMMA paul  crutzen  published  this  essay  saying  roughly  what  's  all  been  said  before ,COMMA that  maybe ,COMMA given  our  very  slow  rate  of  progress  in  solving  this  problem  and  the  uncertain  impacts ,COMMA we  should  think  about  things  like  this .PERIOD he  said  roughly  what  's  been  said  before .PERIOD the  big  deal  was  he  happened  to  have  won  the  nobel  prize  for  ozone  chemistry .PERIOD and  so  people  took  him  seriously  when  he  said  we  should  think  about  this ,COMMA even  though  there  will  be  some  ozone  impacts .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA he  had  some  ideas  to  make  them  go  away .PERIOD there  was  all  sorts  of  press  coverage ,COMMA all  over  the  world ,COMMA going  right  down  to  dr.  strangelove  saves  the  earth ,COMMA from  the  economist .PERIOD and  that  got  me  thinking .PERIOD i've  worked  on  this  topic  on  and  off ,COMMA but  not  so  much  technically .PERIOD and  i  was  actually  lying  in  bed  thinking  one  night .PERIOD and  i  thought  about  this  child  's  toy ,COMMA hence ,COMMA the  title  of  my  talk ,COMMA and  i  wondered  if  you  could  use  the  same  physics  that  makes  that  thing  spin  round  in  the  child  's  radiometer ,COMMA to  levitate  particles  into  the  upper  atmosphere  and  make  them  stay  there .PERIOD one  of  the  problems  with  sulfates  is  they  fall  out  quickly .PERIOD the  other  problem  is  they  're  right  in  the  ozone  layer ,COMMA and  i'd  prefer  them  above  the  ozone  layer .PERIOD and  it  turns  out ,COMMA i  woke  up  the  next  morning ,COMMA and  i  started  to  calculate  this .PERIOD it  was  very  hard  to  calculate  from  first  principles .PERIOD i  was  stumped .PERIOD but  then  i  found  out  that  there  were  all  sorts  of  papers  already  published  that  addressed  this  topic  because  it  happens  already  in  the  natural  atmosphere .PERIOD so  it  seems  there  are  already  fine  particles  that  are  levitated  up  to  what  we  call  the  mesosphere ,COMMA about  100  kilometers  up ,COMMA that  already  have  this  effect .PERIOD i  'll  tell  you  very  quickly  how  the  effect  works .PERIOD there  are  a  lot  of  fun  complexities  that  i'd  love  to  spend  the  whole  evening  on ,COMMA but  i  wo  n't .PERIOD but  let  's  say  you  have  sunlight  hitting  some  particle  and  it  's  unevenly  heated .PERIOD so  the  side  facing  the  sun  is  warmer .PERIOD the  side  away ,COMMA cooler .PERIOD gas  molecules  that  bounce  off  the  warm  side  bounce  away  with  some  extra  velocity  because  it  's  warm .PERIOD and  so  you  see  a  net  force  away  from  the  sun .PERIOD that  's  called  the  photophoretic  force .PERIOD there  are  a  bunch  of  other  versions  of  it  that  i  and  some  collaborators  have  thought  about  how  to  exploit .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA we  may  be  wrong ,COMMA this  has  n't  all  been  peer  reviewed ,COMMA we  're  in  the  middle  of  thinking  about  it ,COMMA but  so  far ,COMMA it  seems  good .PERIOD but  it  looks  like  we  could  achieve  long  atmospheric  lifetimes ,COMMA much  longer  than  before ,COMMA because  they  're  levitated .PERIOD we  can  move  things  out  of  the  stratosphere  into  the  mesosphere ,COMMA in  principle  solving  the  ozone  problem .PERIOD i  'm  sure  there  will  be  other  problems  that  arise .PERIOD finally ,COMMA we  could  make  the  particles  migrate  to  over  the  poles ,COMMA so  we  could  arrange  the  climate  engineering  so  it  really  focused  on  the  poles .PERIOD which  would  have  minimal  bad  impacts  in  the  middle  of  the  planet ,COMMA where  we  live ,COMMA and  do  the  maximum  job  of  what  we  might  need  to  do ,COMMA which  is  cooling  the  poles  in  case  of  planetary  emergency ,COMMA if  you  like .PERIOD this  is  a  new  idea  that  's  crept  up  that  may  be ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA a  cleverer  idea  than  putting  sulfates  in .PERIOD whether  this  idea  is  right  or  some  other  idea  is  right ,COMMA i  think  it  's  almost  certain  we  will  eventually  think  of  cleverer  things  to  do  than  just  putting  sulfur  in .PERIOD that  if  engineers  and  scientists  really  turned  their  minds  to  this ,COMMA it  's  amazing  how  we  can  affect  the  planet .PERIOD the  one  thing  about  this  is  it  gives  us  extraordinary  leverage .PERIOD this  improved  science  and  engineering  will ,COMMA whether  we  like  it  or  not ,COMMA give  us  more  and  more  leverage  to  affect  the  planet .PERIOD to  control  the  planet .PERIOD to  give  us  weather  and  climate  control ,COMMA not  because  we  plan  it ,COMMA not  because  we  want  it ,COMMA just  because  science  delivers  it  to  us  bit  by  bit ,COMMA with  better  knowledge  of  the  way  the  system  works  and  better  engineering  tools  to  effect  it .PERIOD now ,COMMA suppose  that  space  aliens  arrived .PERIOD maybe  they  're  going  to  land  at  the  un .PERIOD headquarters  down  the  road  here ,COMMA or  maybe  they  'll  pick  a  smarter  spot ,COMMA but  suppose  they  arrive  and  they  give  you  a  box .PERIOD and  the  box  has  two  knobs .PERIOD one  knob  is  the  knob  for  controlling  global  temperature .PERIOD maybe  another  knob  is  a  knob  for  controlling  co2  concentrations .PERIOD you  might  imagine  that  we  would  fight  wars  over  that  box .PERIOD because  we  have  no  way  to  agree  about  where  to  set  the  knobs .PERIOD we  have  no  global  governance .PERIOD and  different  people  will  have  different  places  they  want  it  set .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  do  n't  think  that  's  going  to  happen .PERIOD it  's  not  very  likely .PERIOD but  we  're  building  that  box .PERIOD the  scientists  and  engineers  of  the  world  are  building  it  piece  by  piece ,COMMA in  their  labs .PERIOD even  when  they  're  doing  it  for  other  reasons .PERIOD even  when  they  're  thinking  they  're  just  working  on  protecting  the  environment .PERIOD they  have  no  interest  in  crazy  ideas  like  engineering  the  whole  planet .PERIOD they  develop  science  that  makes  it  easier  and  easier  to  do .PERIOD and  so  i  guess  my  view  on  this  is  not  that  i  want  to  do  it ,COMMA i  do  not ,COMMA but  that  we  should  move  this  out  of  the  shadows  and  talk  about  it  seriously .PERIOD because  sooner  or  later ,COMMA we  'll  be  confronted  with  decisions  about  this ,COMMA and  it  's  better  if  we  think  hard  about  it ,COMMA even  if  we  want  to  think  hard  about  reasons  why  we  should  never  do  it .PERIOD i  'll  give  you  two  different  ways  to  think  about  this  problem  that  are  the  beginning  of  my  thinking  about  how  to  think  about  it .PERIOD but  what  we  need  is  not  just  a  few  oddballs  like  me  thinking  about  this .PERIOD we  need  a  broader  debate .PERIOD a  debate  that  involves  musicians ,COMMA scientists ,COMMA philosophers ,COMMA writers ,COMMA who  get  engaged  with  this  question  about  climate  engineering  and  think  seriously  about  what  its  implications  are .PERIOD so  here  's  one  way  to  think  about  it ,COMMA which  is  that  we  just  do  this  instead  of  cutting  emissions  because  it  's  cheaper .PERIOD i  guess  the  thing  i  have  n't  said  about  this  is ,COMMA it  is  absurdly  cheap .PERIOD it  's  conceivable  that ,COMMA say ,COMMA using  the  sulfates  method  or  this  method  i've  come  up  with ,COMMA you  could  create  an  ice  age  at  a  cost  of  001  percent  of  gdp .PERIOD it  's  very  cheap .PERIOD we  have  a  lot  of  leverage .PERIOD it  's  not  a  good  idea ,COMMA but  it  's  just  important .PERIOD i  'll  tell  you  how  big  the  lever  is ,COMMA the  lever  is  that  big .PERIOD and  that  calculation  is  n't  much  in  dispute .PERIOD you  might  argue  about  the  sanity  of  it ,COMMA but  the  leverage  is  real .PERIOD so  because  of  this ,COMMA we  could  deal  with  the  problem  simply  by  stopping  reducing  emissions .PERIOD and  just  as  the  concentrations  go  up ,COMMA we  can  increase  the  amount  of  geo-engineering .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  anybody  takes  that  seriously .PERIOD because  under  this  scenario ,COMMA we  walk  further  and  further  away  from  the  current  climate .PERIOD we  have  all  sorts  of  other  problems ,COMMA like  ocean  acidification  that  come  from  co2  in  the  atmosphere ,COMMA anyway .PERIOD nobody  but  maybe  one  or  two  very  odd  folks  really  suggest  this .PERIOD but  here  's  a  case  which  is  harder  to  reject .PERIOD let  's  say  that  we  do  n't  do  geo-engineering ,COMMA we  do  what  we  ought  to  do ,COMMA which  is  get  serious  about  cutting  emissions .PERIOD but  we  do  n't  really  know  how  quickly  we  have  to  cut  them .PERIOD there  's  a  lot  of  uncertainty  about  exactly  how  much  climate  change  is  too  much .PERIOD so  let  's  say  that  we  work  hard ,COMMA and  we  actually  do  n't  just  tap  the  brakes ,COMMA but  we  step  hard  on  the  brakes  and  really  reduce  emissions  and  eventually  reduce  concentrations .PERIOD and  maybe  someday ,COMMA like  2075 ,COMMA october  23 ,COMMA we  finally  reach  that  glorious  day  where  concentrations  have  peaked  and  are  rolling  down  the  other  side .PERIOD and  we  have  global  celebrations ,COMMA and  we've  actually  started  to ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA we've  seen  the  worst  of  it .PERIOD but  maybe  on  that  day  we  also  find  that  the  greenland  ice  sheet  is  really  melting  unacceptably  fast ,COMMA fast  enough  to  put  meters  of  sea  level  on  the  oceans  in  the  next  100  years ,COMMA and  remove  some  of  the  biggest  cities  from  the  map .PERIOD that  's  an  absolutely  possible  scenario .PERIOD we  might  decide  at  that  point  that  even  though  geo-engineering  was  uncertain  and  morally  unhappy ,COMMA that  it  's  a  lot  better  than  not  geo-engineering .PERIOD and  that  's  a  very  different  way  to  look  at  the  problem .PERIOD it  's  using  this  as  risk  control ,COMMA not  instead  of  action .PERIOD it  's  saying  that  you  do  some  geo-engineering  for  a  little  while  to  take  the  worst  of  the  heat  off ,COMMA not  that  you'd  use  it  as  a  substitute  for  action .PERIOD but  there  is  a  problem  with  that  view .PERIOD and  the  problem  is  the  following ,COMMA knowledge  that  geo-engineering  is  possible  makes  the  climate  impacts  look  less  fearsome .PERIOD and  that  makes  a  weaker  commitment  to  cutting  emissions  today .PERIOD this  is  what  economists  call  a  moral  hazard .PERIOD and  that  's  one  of  the  fundamental  reasons  that  this  problem  is  so  hard  to  talk  about ,COMMA and ,COMMA in  general ,COMMA i  think  it  's  the  underlying  reason  that  it  's  been  politically  unacceptable  to  talk  about  this .PERIOD but  you  do  n't  make  good  policy  by  hiding  things  in  a  drawer .PERIOD i  'll  leave  you  with  three  questions ,COMMA and  then  one  final  quote .PERIOD should  we  do  serious  research  on  this  topic ?QUESTIONMARK should  we  have  a  national  research  program  that  looks  at  this ?QUESTIONMARK not  just  at  how  you  would  do  it  better ,COMMA but  also  what  all  the  risks  and  downsides  of  it  are .PERIOD right  now ,COMMA you  have  a  few  enthusiasts  talking  about  it ,COMMA some  in  a  positive  side ,COMMA some  in  a  negative  side ,COMMA but  that  's  a  dangerous  state  to  be  in  because  there  's  very  little  depth  of  knowledge  on  this  topic .PERIOD a  very  small  amount  of  money  would  get  us  some .PERIOD many  of  us ,COMMA maybe  now  me ,COMMA think  we  should  do  that .PERIOD but  i  have  a  lot  of  reservations .PERIOD my  reservations  are  principally  about  the  moral  hazard  problem ,COMMA and  i  do  n't  really  know  how  we  can  best  avoid  the  moral  hazard .PERIOD i  think  there  is  a  serious  problem ,COMMA as  you  talk  about  this .PERIOD people  begin  to  think  they  do  n't  need  to  work  so  hard  to  cut  emissions .PERIOD another  thing  is ,COMMA maybe  we  need  a  treaty .PERIOD a  treaty  that  decides  who  gets  to  do  this .PERIOD right  now  we  may  think  of  a  big ,COMMA rich  country  like  the  us .PERIOD doing  this .PERIOD but  it  might  well  be  that ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA if  china  wakes  up  in  2030  and  realizes  that  the  climate  impacts  are  just  unacceptable ,COMMA they  may  not  be  very  interested  in  our  moral  conversations  about  how  to  do  this ,COMMA and  they  may  just  decide  they'd  really  rather  have  a  geo-engineered  world  than  a  non-geo-engineered  world .PERIOD and  we  'll  have  no  international  mechanism  to  figure  out  who  makes  the  decision .PERIOD so  here  's  one  last  thought ,COMMA which  was  said  much ,COMMA much  better  25  years  ago  in  the  us .PERIOD national  academy  report  than  i  can  say  today .PERIOD and  i  think  it  really  summarizes  where  we  are  here .PERIOD that  the  co2  problem ,COMMA the  climate  problem  that  we've  heard  about ,COMMA is  driving  lots  of  things ,COMMA innovations  in  the  energy  technologies  that  will  reduce  emissions  -- .PERIOD but  also ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA inevitably ,COMMA it  will  drive  us  towards  thinking  about  climate  and  weather  control ,COMMA whether  we  like  it  or  not .PERIOD and  it  's  time  to  begin  thinking  about  it ,COMMA even  if  the  reason  we  're  thinking  about  it  is  to  construct  arguments  for  why  we  should  n't  do  it .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD where  do  we  go  from  here ?QUESTIONMARK how  do  we  carry  on ?QUESTIONMARK i  cannot  get  beyond  the  questions  clambering  for  the  scraps  in  the  shatter  of  us ,COMMA collapsed  it  cuts  me  with  every  could  have  been  pain  on  pain  on  play ,COMMA repeating  with  the  backup ,COMMA makeshift  life  in  waiting

about  12  years  ago ,COMMA and  i  started  in  the  context  of  developing  countries ,COMMA but  you  're  sitting  here  from  every  corner  of  the  world .PERIOD so  if  you  think  of  a  map  of  your  country ,COMMA i  think  you  'll  realize  that  for  every  country  on  earth ,COMMA you  could  draw  little  circles  to  say ,COMMA these  are  places  where  good  teachers  wo

those  places  where  they  're  needed  the  most .PERIOD i  started  in  1999  to  try  and  address  this  problem  with  an  experiment ,COMMA which  was  a  very  simple  experiment  in  new  delhi .PERIOD i  basically  embedded  a  computer  into  a  wall  of  a  slum  in  new  delhi .PERIOD the  children  barely  went  to  school ,COMMA they  did  n't  know  any  english  -- .PERIOD they'd  never  seen  a  computer  before ,COMMA and  they  did  n't  know  what  the  internet  was .PERIOD i  connected  high  speed  internet  to  it ,COMMA it  's  about  three  feet  off  the

india  and  then  through  a  large  part  of  the  world  and  noticed  that  children  will  learn  to  do  what  they  want  to  learn  to  do .PERIOD this  is  the  first  experiment  that  we  did ,COMMA eight  year-old  boy  on  your  right  teaching  his  student ,COMMA a  six  year-old  girl ,COMMA and  he  was  teaching  her  how  to  browse .PERIOD this  boy  here  in  the  middle  of  central  india ,COMMA this  is  in  a  rajasthan  village ,COMMA where  the  children  recorded  their  own  music  and  then  played  it  back  to  each  other  and  in  the  process ,COMMA they've  enjoyed  themselves  thoroughly .PERIOD they  did  all  of  this  in  four  hours  after  seeing  the  computer  for  the  first  time .PERIOD in  another  south  indian  village ,COMMA these  boys  here  had  assembled  a  video  camera  and  were  trying  to  take  the  photograph  of  a  bumble  bee .PERIOD they  downloaded  it  from  disneycom ,COMMA or  one  of  these  websites ,COMMA 14  days  after  putting  the  computer  in  their  village .PERIOD so  at  the  end  of  it ,COMMA we  concluded  that  groups  of  children  can  learn  to  use  computers  and  the  internet  on  their  own ,COMMA irrespective  of  who  or  where  they  were .PERIOD at  that  point ,COMMA i  became  a  little  more  ambitious  and  decided  to  see  what  else  could  children  do  with  a  computer .PERIOD we  started  off  with  an  experiment  in  hyderabad ,COMMA india ,COMMA where  i  gave  a  group  of  children ,COMMA they  spoke  english  with  a  very  strong  telugu  accent .PERIOD i  gave  them  a  computer  with  a  speech-to-text  interface ,COMMA which  you  now  get  free  with  windows ,COMMA and  asked  them  to  speak  into  it .PERIOD so  when  they  spoke  into  it ,COMMA the  computer  typed  out  gibberish ,COMMA so  they  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA it  does  n't  understand  anything  of  what  we  are  saying .PERIOD so  i  said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA i  'll  leave  it  here  for  two  months .PERIOD make  yourself  understood  to  the  computer .PERIOD so  the  children  said ,COMMA how  do  we  do  that .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA i  do  n't  know ,COMMA actually .PERIOD and  i  left .PERIOD two  months  later ,COMMA and  this  is  now  documented  in  the  information  technology  for  international  development  journal ,COMMA that  accents  had  changed  and  were  remarkably  close  to  the  neutral  british  accent  in  which  i  had  trained  the  speech-to-text  synthesizer .PERIOD in  other  words ,COMMA they  were  all  speaking  like  james  tooley .PERIOD so  they  could  do  that  on  their  own .PERIOD after  that ,COMMA i  started  to  experiment  with  various  other  things  that  they  might  learn  to  do  on  their  own .PERIOD i  got  an  interesting  phone  call  once  from  columbo ,COMMA from  the  late  arthur  c .PERIOD clarke ,COMMA who  said ,COMMA i  want  to  see  what  's  going  on .PERIOD and  he  could  n't  travel ,COMMA so  i  went  over  there .PERIOD he  said  two  interesting  things ,COMMA a  teacher  that  can  be  replaced  by  a  machine  should  be .PERIOD the  second  thing  he  said  was  that ,COMMA if  children  have  interest ,COMMA then  education  happens  and  i  was  doing  that  in  the  field ,COMMA so  every  time  i  would  watch  it  and  think  of  him .PERIOD arthur  c .PERIOD clarke ,COMMA and  they  can  definitely  help  people ,COMMA because  children  quickly  learn  to  navigate  the  web  and  find  things  which  interest  them .PERIOD and  when  you've  got  interest ,COMMA then  you  have  education .PERIOD sugata  mitra ,COMMA i  took  the  experiment  to  south  africa .PERIOD this  is  a  15  year-old  boy .PERIOD boy .PERIOD just  mention ,COMMA i  play  games  like  animals ,COMMA and  i  listen  to  music .PERIOD sm ,COMMA and  i  asked  him ,COMMA do  you  send  emails ?QUESTIONMARK and  he  said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA and  they  hop  across  the  ocean .PERIOD this  is  in  cambodia ,COMMA rural  cambodia ,COMMA a  fairly  silly  arithmetic  game ,COMMA which  no  child  would  play  inside  the  classroom  or  at  home .PERIOD they  would ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA throw  it  back  at  you .PERIOD they'd  say ,COMMA this  is  very  boring .PERIOD if  you  leave  it  on  the  pavement  and  if  all  the  adults  go  away ,COMMA then  they  will  show  off  with  each  other  about  what  they  can  do .PERIOD this  is  what  these  children  are  doing .PERIOD they  are  trying  to  multiply ,COMMA i  think .PERIOD and  all  over  india ,COMMA at  the  end  of  about  two  years ,COMMA children  were  beginning  to  google  their  homework .PERIOD as  a  result ,COMMA the  teachers  reported  tremendous  improvements  in  their  english ,COMMA rapid  improvement  and  all  sorts  of  things .PERIOD they  said ,COMMA they  have  become  really  deep  thinkers  and  so  on  and  so  forth .PERIOD and  indeed  they  had .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA if  there  's  stuff  on  google ,COMMA why  would  you  need  to  stuff  it  into  your  head ?QUESTIONMARK so  at  the  end  of  the  next  four  years ,COMMA i  decided  that  groups  of  children  can  navigate  the  internet  to  achieve  educational  objectives  on  their  own .PERIOD at  that  time ,COMMA a  large  amount  of  money  had  come  into  newcastle  university  to  improve  schooling  in  india .PERIOD so  newcastle  gave  me  a  call .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA i  'll  do  it  from  delhi .PERIOD they  said ,COMMA there  's  no  way  you  're  going  to  handle  a  million  pounds-worth  of  university  money  sitting  in  delhi .PERIOD so  in  2006 ,COMMA i  bought  myself  a  heavy  overcoat  and  moved  to  newcastle .PERIOD i  wanted  to  test  the  limits  of  the  system .PERIOD the  first  experiment  i  did  out  of  newcastle  was  actually  done  in  india .PERIOD and  i  set  myself  and  impossible  target ,COMMA can  tamil  speaking  12-year-old  children  in  a  south  indian  village  teach  themselves  biotechnology  in  english  on  their  own ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  thought ,COMMA i  'll  test  them ,COMMA they  'll  get  a  zero  -- .PERIOD i  'll  give  the  materials ,COMMA i  'll  come  back  and  test  them  -- .PERIOD they  get  another  zero .PERIOD i  'll  go  back  and  say ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we  need  teachers  for  certain  things .PERIOD i  called  in  26  children .PERIOD they  all  came  in  there ,COMMA and  i  told  them  that  there  's  some  really  difficult  stuff  on  this  computer .PERIOD i  would  n't  be  surprised  if  you  did  n't  understand  anything .PERIOD it  's  all  in  english ,COMMA and  i  'm  going .PERIOD so  i  left  them  with  it .PERIOD i  came  back  after  two  months ,COMMA and  the  26  children  marched  in  looking  very ,COMMA very  quiet .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA did  you  look  at  any  of  the  stuff ?QUESTIONMARK they  said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we  did .PERIOD did  you  understand  anything  no ,COMMA nothing .PERIOD so  i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how  long  did  you  practice  on  it  before  you  decided  you  understood  nothing ?QUESTIONMARK they  said ,COMMA we  look  at  it  every  day .PERIOD so  i  said ,COMMA for  two  months ,COMMA you  were  looking  at  stuff  you  did  n't  understand ?QUESTIONMARK so  a  12  year-old  girl  raises  her  hand  and  says ,COMMA literally ,COMMA apart  from  the  fact  that  improper  replication  of  the  dna  molecule  causes  genetic  disease ,COMMA we've  understood  nothing  else .PERIOD it  took  me  three  years  to  publish  that .PERIOD it  's  just  been  published  in  the  british  journal  of  educational  technology .PERIOD one  of  the  referees  who  refereed  the  paper  said ,COMMA it  's  too  good  to  be  true ,COMMA which  was  not  very  nice .PERIOD well ,COMMA one  of  the  girls  had  taught  herself  to  become  the  teacher .PERIOD and  then  that  's  her  over  there .PERIOD remember ,COMMA they  do  n't  study  english .PERIOD i  edited  out  the  last  bit  when  i  asked ,COMMA where  is  the  neuron ?QUESTIONMARK and  she  says ,COMMA the  neuron ?QUESTIONMARK the  neuron .PERIOD and  then  she  looked  and  did  this .PERIOD whatever  the  expression ,COMMA it  was  not  very  nice .PERIOD so  their  scores  had  gone  up  from  zero  to  30  percent ,COMMA which  is  an  educational  impossibility  under  the  circumstances .PERIOD but  30  percent  is  not  a  pass .PERIOD so  i  found  that  they  had  a  friend ,COMMA a  local  accountant ,COMMA a  young  girl ,COMMA and  they  played  football  with  her .PERIOD i  asked  that  girl ,COMMA would  you  teach  them  enough  biotechnology  to  pass ?QUESTIONMARK and  she  said ,COMMA how  would  i  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK i  do  n't  know  the  subject .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA no ,COMMA use  the  method  of  the  grandmother .PERIOD she  said ,COMMA what  's  that ?QUESTIONMARK i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA what  you've  got  to  do  is  stand  behind  them  and  admire  them  all  the  time .PERIOD just  say  to  them ,COMMA that  's  cool .PERIOD that  's  fantastic .PERIOD what  is  that ?QUESTIONMARK can  you  do  that  again ?QUESTIONMARK can  you  show  me  some  more' .PERIOD she  did  that  for  two  months .PERIOD the  scores  went  up  to  50 ,COMMA which  is  what  the  posh  schools  of  new  delhi ,COMMA with  a  trained  biotechnology  teacher  were  getting .PERIOD so  i  came  back  to  newcastle  with  these  results  and  decided  that  there  was  something  happening  here  that  definitely  was  getting  very  serious .PERIOD so ,COMMA having  experimented  in  all  sorts  of  remote  places ,COMMA i  came  to  the  most  remote  place  that  i  could  think  of .PERIOD approximately  5,000  miles  from  delhi  is  the  little  town  of  gateshead .PERIOD in  gateshead ,COMMA i  took  32  children  and  i  started  to

.PERIOD and  i  explained  to  them  that ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA a  lot  of  scientific  research  is  done  using  that  method .PERIOD the  children  enthusiastically  got  after  me  and  said ,COMMA now ,COMMA what  do  you  want  us  to  do ?QUESTIONMARK i  gave  them  six  gcse  questions .PERIOD the  first  group ,COMMA the  best  one ,COMMA solved  everything  in  20  minutes .PERIOD

deep  learning ?QUESTIONMARK i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA let  's  try  it .PERIOD i  'll  come  back  after  two  months .PERIOD we  'll  give  them  a  paper  test ,COMMA no  computers ,COMMA no  talking  to  each  other ,COMMA etc .PERIOD the  average  score  when  i'd  done  it  with  the  computers  and  the  groups  was  76  percent .PERIOD when  i  did  the  experiment ,COMMA when  i  did  the  test ,COMMA after  two  months ,COMMA the  score  was  76  percent .PERIOD there  was  photographic  recall  inside  the  children .PERIOD i  suspect  because  they  're  discussing  with  each

 an  empty  space  sometimes .PERIOD the  project  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  about  is  called  the  world  peace  game ,COMMA and  essentially  it  is  also  an  empty  space .PERIOD and  i'd  like  to  think  of  it  as  a  21st  century  wisdom  table ,COMMA really .PERIOD it  all  started  back  in  1977 .PERIOD i  was  a  young  man ,COMMA and  i  had  been  dropping  in  and  out  of  college .PERIOD and  my  parents  were  very  patient ,COMMA but  i  had  been  doing  intermittent  sojourns  to  india  on  a  mystical  quest .PERIOD and  i  remember  the  last  time  i  came  back  from  india ,COMMA in  my  long  white  flowing  robes  and  my  big  beard  and  my  john  lennon  glasses ,COMMA and  i  said  to  my  father ,COMMA dad ,COMMA i  think  i've  just  about  found  spiritual  enlightenment .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA well  there  's  one  more  thing  you  need  to  find .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA what  is  that ,COMMA dad  a  job .PERIOD and  so  they  pleaded  with  me  to  get  a  degree  in  something .PERIOD so  i  got  a  degree  and  it  turned  out  to  be  education .PERIOD it  was  an  experimental  education  program .PERIOD it  could  have  been  dentistry ,COMMA but  the  word  experimental  was  in  it ,COMMA and  so  that  's  what  i  had  to  go  for .PERIOD and  i  went  in  for  a  job  interview  in  the  richmond  public  schools  in  virginia ,COMMA the  capital  city ,COMMA bought  a  three-piece  suit ,COMMA my  concession  to  convention ,COMMA kept  my  long  beard  and  my  afro  and  my  platform  shoes ,COMMA at  the  time  it  was  the  70s ,COMMA and  i  walked  in ,COMMA and  i  sat  down  and  had  an  interview .PERIOD and  i  guess  they  were  hard  up  for  teachers  because  the  supervisor ,COMMA her  name  was  anna  aro ,COMMA said  i  had  the  job  teaching  gifted  children .PERIOD and  i  was  so  shocked ,COMMA so  stunned ,COMMA i  got  up  and  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA thank  you ,COMMA but  what  do  i  do ?QUESTIONMARK gifted  education  had  n't  really  taken  hold  too  much .PERIOD there  were  n't  really  many  materials  or  things  to  use .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA what  do  i  do ?QUESTIONMARK and  her  answer  shocked  me .PERIOD it  stunned  me .PERIOD her  answer  set  the  template  for  the  entire  career  i  was  to  have  after  that .PERIOD she  said ,COMMA what  do  you  want  to  do ?QUESTIONMARK and  that  question  cleared  the  space .PERIOD there  was  no  program  directive ,COMMA no  manual  to  follow ,COMMA no  standards  in  gifted  education  in  that  way .PERIOD and  she  cleared  such  a  space  that  i  endeavored  from  then  on  to  clear  a  space  for  my  students ,COMMA an  empty  space ,COMMA whereby  they  could  create  and  make  meaning  out  of  their  own  understanding .PERIOD so  this  happened  in  1978 ,COMMA and  i  was  teaching  many  years  later ,COMMA and  a  friend  of  mine  introduced  me  to  a  young  filmmaker .PERIOD his  name  is  chris  farina .PERIOD chris  farina  is  here  today  at  his  own  cost .PERIOD chris ,COMMA could  you  stand  up  and  let  them  see  you ,COMMA a  young ,COMMA visionary  filmmaker  who  's  made  a  film .PERIOD this  film  is  called  world  peace  and  other  4th  grade  achievements .PERIOD he  proposed  the  film  to  me ,COMMA it  's  a  great  title .PERIOD he  proposed  the  film  to  me ,COMMA and  i  said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA maybe  it  'll  be  on  local  tv ,COMMA and  we  can  say  hi  to  our  friends .PERIOD but  the  film  has  really  gone  places .PERIOD now  it  's  still  in  debt ,COMMA but  chris  has  managed ,COMMA through  his  own  sacrifice ,COMMA to  get  this  film  out .PERIOD so  we  made  a  film  and  it  turns  out  to  be  more  than  a  story  about  me ,COMMA more  than  a  story  about  one  teacher .PERIOD it  's  a  story  that  's  a  testament  to  teaching  and  teachers .PERIOD and  it  's  a  beautiful  thing .PERIOD and  the  strange  thing  is ,COMMA when  i  watch  the  film ,COMMA i  have  the  eerie  sensation  of  seeing  it ,COMMA i  saw  myself  literally  disappear .PERIOD what  i  saw  was  my  teachers  coming  through  me .PERIOD i  saw  my  geometry  teacher  in  high  school ,COMMA mr.  rucell  's  wry  smile  under  his  handlebar  mustache .PERIOD that  's  the  smile  i  use ,COMMA that  's  his  smile .PERIOD i  saw  jan  polo  's  flashing  eyes .PERIOD and  they  were  n't  flashing  in  anger ,COMMA they  were  flashing  in  love ,COMMA intense  love  for  her  students .PERIOD and  i  have  that  kind  of  flash  sometimes .PERIOD and  i  saw  miss  ethel  j .PERIOD banks  who  wore  pearls  and  high-heels  to  elementary  school  every  day .PERIOD and  you  know ,COMMA she  had  that  old-school  teacher  stare .PERIOD you  know  the  one .PERIOD and  i  'm  not  even  talking  about  you  behind  me ,COMMA because  i've  got  eyes  in  the  back  of  my  head .PERIOD you  know  that  teacher ?QUESTIONMARK i  did  n't  use  that  stare  very  often ,COMMA but  i  do  have  it  in  my  repertoire .PERIOD and  miss  banks  was  there  as  a  great  mentor  for  me .PERIOD and  then  i  saw  my  own  parents ,COMMA my  first  teachers .PERIOD my  father ,COMMA very  inventive ,COMMA spatial  thinker .PERIOD that  's  my  brother  malcolm  there  on  the  right .PERIOD and  my  mother ,COMMA who  taught  me  in  fourth  grade  in  segregated  schools  in  virginia ,COMMA who  was  my  inspiration .PERIOD and  really ,COMMA i  feel  as  though ,COMMA when  i  see  the  film ,COMMA i  have  a  gesture  she  does ,COMMA like  this ,COMMA i  feel  like  i  am  a  continuation  of  her  gesture .PERIOD i  am  one  of  her  teaching  gestures .PERIOD and  the  beautiful  thing  was ,COMMA i  got  to  teach  my  daughter  in  elementary  school ,COMMA madeline .PERIOD and  so  that  gesture  of  my  mother  's  continues  through  many  generations .PERIOD it  's  an  amazing  feeling  to  have  that  lineage .PERIOD and  so  i  'm  here  standing  on  the  shoulders  of  many  people .PERIOD i  'm  not  here  alone .PERIOD there  are  many  people  on  this  stage  right  now .PERIOD and  so  this  world  peace  game  i'd  like  to  tell  you  about .PERIOD it  started  out  like  this ,COMMA it  's  just  a  four-foot  by  five-foot  plywood  board  in  an  inner-city  urban  school ,COMMA 1978 .PERIOD i  was  creating  a  lesson  for  students  on  africa .PERIOD we  put  all  the  problems  of  the  world  there ,COMMA and  i  thought ,COMMA let  's  let  them  solve  it .PERIOD i  did  n't  want  to  lecture  or  have  just  book  reading .PERIOD i  wanted  to  have  them  be  immersed  and  learn  the  feeling  of  learning  through  their  bodies .PERIOD so  i  thought ,COMMA well  they  like  to  play  games .PERIOD i  'll  make  something ,COMMA i  did  n't  say  interactive .PERIOD we  did  n't  have  that  term  in  1978 ,COMMA but  something  interactive .PERIOD and  so  we  made  the  game ,COMMA and  it  has  since  evolved  to  a  four-foot  by  four-foot  by  four-foot  plexiglass  structure .PERIOD and  it  has  four  plexiglass  layers .PERIOD there  's  an  outer  space  layer  with  black  holes  and  satellites  and  research  satellites  and  asteroid  mining .PERIOD there  's  an  air  and  space  level  with  clouds  that  are  big  puffs  of  cotton  we  push  around  and  territorial  air  spaces  and  air  forces ,COMMA a  ground  and  sea  level  with  thousands  of  game  pieces  on  it ,COMMA even  an  undersea  level  with  submarines  and  undersea  mining .PERIOD there  are  four  countries  around  the  board .PERIOD the  kids  make  up  the  names  of  the  countries ,COMMA some  are  rich .PERIOD some  are  poor .PERIOD they  have  different  assets ,COMMA commercial  and  military .PERIOD and  each  country  has  a  cabinet .PERIOD there  's  a  prime  minister ,COMMA secretary  of  state ,COMMA minister  of  defense  and  a  cfo ,COMMA or  comptroller .PERIOD i  choose  the  prime  minister  based  on  my  relationship  with  them .PERIOD i  offer  them  the  job ,COMMA they  can  turn  it  down ,COMMA and  then  they  choose  their  own  cabinet .PERIOD there  's  a  world  bank ,COMMA arms  dealers  and  a  united  nations .PERIOD there  's  also  a  weather  goddess  who  controls  a  random  stock  market  and  random  weather .PERIOD that  's  not  all .PERIOD and  then  there  's  a  13-page  crisis  document  with  50  interlocking  problems .PERIOD so  that ,COMMA if  one  thing  changes ,COMMA everything  else  changes .PERIOD i  throw  them  into  this  complex  matrix ,COMMA and  they  trust  me  because  we  have  a  deep ,COMMA rich  relationship  together .PERIOD and  so  with  all  these  crises ,COMMA we  have ,COMMA let  's  see ,COMMA ethnic  and  minority  tensions .PERIOD we  have  chemical  and  nuclear  spills ,COMMA nuclear  proliferation .PERIOD there  's  oil  spills ,COMMA environmental  disasters ,COMMA water  rights  disputes ,COMMA breakaway  republics ,COMMA famine ,COMMA endangered  species  and  global  warming .PERIOD if  al  gore  is  here ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  send  my  fourth-graders  from  agnor-hurt  and  venable  schools  to  you  because  they  solved  global  warming  in  a  week .PERIOD and  they've  done  it  several  times  too .PERIOD so  i  also  have  in  the  game  a  saboteur ,COMMA some  child ,COMMA it  's  basically  a  troublemaker ,COMMA and  i  have  my  troublemaker  put  to  use  because  they ,COMMA on  the  surface ,COMMA are  trying  to  save  the  world  and  their  position  in  the  game .PERIOD but  they  're  also  trying  to  undermine  everything  in  the  game .PERIOD and  they  do  it  secretly  through  misinformation  and  ambiguities  and  irrelevancies ,COMMA trying  to  cause  everyone  to  think  more  deeply .PERIOD the  saboteur  is  there ,COMMA and  we  also  read  from  sun  tzu  's  the  art  of  war  fourth-graders  understand  it ,COMMA nine  years  old ,COMMA and  they  handle  that  and  use  that  to  understand  how  to ,COMMA not  follow ,COMMA at  first  they  do ,COMMA the  paths  to  power  and  destruction ,COMMA the  path  to  war .PERIOD they  learn  to  overlook  short-sighted  reactions  and  impulsive  thinking ,COMMA to  think  in  a  long-term ,COMMA more  consequential  way .PERIOD stewart  brand  is  here ,COMMA and  one  of  the  ideas  for  this  game  came  from  him  with  a  coevolution  quarterly  article  on  a  peace  force .PERIOD and  in  the  game ,COMMA sometimes  students  actually  form  a  peace  force .PERIOD i  'm  just  a  clock  watcher .PERIOD i  'm  just  a  clarifier .PERIOD i  'm  just  a  facilitator .PERIOD the  students  run  the  game .PERIOD i  have  no  chance  to  make  any  policy  whatsoever  once  they  start  playing .PERIOD so  i  'll  just  share  with  you .PERIOD boy ,COMMA the  world  peace  game  is  serious .PERIOD you  're  actually  getting  taught  something  like  how  to  take  care  of  the  world .PERIOD see ,COMMA mr.  hunter  is  doing  that  because  he  says  his  time  has  messed  up  a  lot ,COMMA and  he  's  trying  to  tell  us  how  to  fix  that  problem .PERIOD john  hunter ,COMMA i  offered  them  a ,COMMA actually ,COMMA i  cannot  tell  them  anything  because  i  do  n't  know  the  answer .PERIOD and  i  admit  the  truth  to  them  right  up  front ,COMMA i  do  n't  know .PERIOD and  because  i  do  n't  know ,COMMA they've  got  to  dig  up  the  answer .PERIOD and  so  i  apologize  to  them  as  well .PERIOD i  say ,COMMA i  'm  so  sorry ,COMMA boys  and  girls ,COMMA but  the  truth  is  we  have  left  this  world  to  you  in  such  a  sad  and  terrible  shape ,COMMA and  we  hope  you  can  fix  it  for  us ,COMMA and  maybe  this  game  will  help  you  learn  how  to  do  it .PERIOD it  's  a  sincere  apology ,COMMA and  they  take  it  very  seriously .PERIOD now  you  may  be  wondering  what  all  this  complexity  looks  like .PERIOD well  when  we  have  the  game  start ,COMMA here  's  what  you  see .PERIOD jh ,COMMA all  right ,COMMA we  're  going  into  negotiations  as  of  now .PERIOD go .PERIOD jh ,COMMA my  question  to  you  is ,COMMA who  's  in  charge  of  that  classroom ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  a  serious  question ,COMMA who  is  really  in  charge ?QUESTIONMARK i've  learned  to  cede  control  of  the  classroom  over  to  the  students  over  time .PERIOD there  's  a  trust  and  an  understanding  and  a  dedication  to  an  ideal  that  i  simply  do  n't  have  to  do  what  i  thought  i  had  to  do  as  a  beginning  teacher ,COMMA control  every  conversation  and  response  in  the  classroom .PERIOD it  's  impossible .PERIOD their  collective  wisdom  is  much  greater  than  mine ,COMMA and  i  admit  it  to  them  openly .PERIOD so  i  'll  just  share  with  you  some  stories  very  quickly  of  some  magical  things  that  have  happened .PERIOD in  this  game  we  had  a  little  girl ,COMMA and  she  was  the  defense  minister  of  the  poorest  nation .PERIOD and  the  defense  minister ,COMMA she  had  the  tank  corps  and  air  force  and  so  forth .PERIOD and  she  was  next  door  to  a  very  wealthy ,COMMA oil-rich  neighbor .PERIOD without  provocation ,COMMA suddenly  she  attacked ,COMMA against  her  prime  minister  's  orders ,COMMA the  next-door  neighbor  's  oil  fields .PERIOD she  marched  into  the  oil  field  reserves ,COMMA surrounded  it ,COMMA without  firing  a  shot ,COMMA and  secured  it  and  held  it .PERIOD and  that  neighbor  was  unable  to  conduct  any  military  operations  because  their  fuel  supply  was  locked  up .PERIOD we  were  all  upset  with  her ,COMMA why  are  you  doing  this ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  the  world  peace  game .PERIOD what  is  wrong  with  you ?QUESTIONMARK this  was  a  little  girl  and ,COMMA at  nine  years  old ,COMMA she  held  her  pieces  and  said ,COMMA i  know  what  i  'm  doing .PERIOD to  her  girlfriends  she  said  that .PERIOD that  's  a  breach  there .PERIOD and  we  learned  in  this ,COMMA you  do  n't  really  ever  want  to  cross  a  nine  year-old  girl  with  tanks .PERIOD they  are  the  toughest  opponents .PERIOD and  we  were  very  upset .PERIOD i  thought  i  was  failing  as  a  teacher .PERIOD why  would  she  do  this ?QUESTIONMARK but  come  to  find  out ,COMMA a  few  game  days  later ,COMMA and  there  are  turns  where  we  take  negotiation  from  a  team ,COMMA actually  there  's  a  negotiation  period  with  all  teams ,COMMA and  each  team  takes  a  turn ,COMMA then  we  go  back  in  negotiation ,COMMA around  and  around ,COMMA so  each  turn  around  is  one  game  day .PERIOD so  a  few  game  days  later  it  came  to  light  that  we  found  out  this  major  country  was  planning  a  military  offensive  to  dominate  the  entire  world .PERIOD had  they  had  their  fuel  supplies ,COMMA they  would  have  done  it .PERIOD she  was  able  to  see  the  vectors  and  trend  lines  and  intentions  long  before  any  of  us  and  understand  what  was  going  to  happen  and  made  a  philosophical  decision  to  attack  in  a  peace  game .PERIOD now  she  used  a  small  war  to  avert  a  larger  war ,COMMA so  we  stopped  and  had  a  very  good  philosophical  discussion  about  whether  that  was  right ,COMMA conditional  good ,COMMA or  not  right .PERIOD that  's  the  kind  of  thinking  that  we  put  them  in ,COMMA the  situations .PERIOD i  could  not  have  designed  that  in  teaching  it .PERIOD it  came  about  spontaneously  through  their  collective  wisdom .PERIOD another  example ,COMMA a  beautiful  thing  happened .PERIOD we  have  a  letter  in  the  game .PERIOD if  you  're  a  military  commander  and  you  wage  troops ,COMMA the  little  plastic  toys  on  the  board ,COMMA and  you  lose  them ,COMMA i  put  in  a  letter .PERIOD you  have  to  write  a  letter  to  their  parents ,COMMA the  fictional  parents  of  your  fictional  troops ,COMMA explaining  what  happened  and  offering  your  condolences .PERIOD so  you  have  a  little  bit  more  thought  before  you  commit  to  combat .PERIOD and  so  we  had  this  situation  come  up ,COMMA last  summer  actually ,COMMA at  agnor-hurt  school  in  albemarle  county ,COMMA and  one  of  our  military  commanders  got  up  to  read  that  letter  and  one  of  the  other  kids  said ,COMMA mr.  hunter ,COMMA let  's  ask ,COMMA there  's  a  parent  over  there .PERIOD there  was  a  parent  visiting  that  day ,COMMA just  sitting  in  the  back  of  the  room .PERIOD let  's  ask  that  mom  to  read  the  letter .PERIOD it  'll  be  more  realer  if  she  reads  it .PERIOD so  we  did ,COMMA we  asked  her ,COMMA and  she  gamely  picked  up  the  letter .PERIOD sure  she  started  reading .PERIOD she  read  one  sentence .PERIOD she  read  two  sentences .PERIOD by  the  third  sentence ,COMMA she  was  in  tears .PERIOD i  was  in  tears .PERIOD everybody  understood  that  when  we  lose  somebody ,COMMA the  winners  are  not  gloating .PERIOD we  all  lose .PERIOD and  it  was  an  amazing  occurrence  and  an  amazing  understanding .PERIOD i  'll  show  you  what  my  friend  david  says  about  this .PERIOD he  's  been  in  many  battles .PERIOD david ,COMMA we've  really  had  enough  of  people  attacking .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA we've  been  lucky  most  of  the  time .PERIOD but  now  i  'm  feeling  really  weird  because  i  'm  living  what  sun  tzu  said  one  week .PERIOD one  week  he  said ,COMMA those  who  go  into  battle  and  win  will  want  to  go  back ,COMMA and  those  who  lose  in  battle  will  want  to  go  back  and  win .PERIOD and  so  i've  been  winning  battles ,COMMA so  i  'm  going  into  battles ,COMMA more  battles .PERIOD and  i  think  it  's  sort  of  weird  to  be  living  what  sun  tzu  said .PERIOD jh ,COMMA i  get  chills  every  time  i  see  that .PERIOD that  's  the  kind  of  engagement  you  want  to  have  happen .PERIOD and  i  cannot  design  that ,COMMA i  cannot  plan  that ,COMMA and  i  cannot  even  test  that .PERIOD but  it  's  self-evident  assessment .PERIOD we  know  that  's  an  authentic  assessment  of  learning .PERIOD we  have  a  lot  of  data ,COMMA but  i  think  sometimes  we  go  beyond  data  with  the  real  truth  of  what  's  going  on .PERIOD so  i  'll  just  share  a  third  story .PERIOD this  is  about  my  friend  brennan .PERIOD we  had  played  the  game  one  session  after  school  for  many  weeks ,COMMA about  seven  weeks ,COMMA and  we  had  essentially  solved  all  50  of  the  interlocking  crises .PERIOD the  way  the  game  is  won  is  all  50  problems  have  to  be  solved  and  every  country  's  asset  value  has  to  be  increased  above  its  starting  point .PERIOD some  are  poor ,COMMA some  are  wealthy .PERIOD there  are  billions .PERIOD the  world  bank  president  was  a  third-grader  one  time .PERIOD he  says ,COMMA how  many  zeros  in  a  trillion ?QUESTIONMARK i've  got  to  calculate  that  right  away .PERIOD but  he  was  setting  fiscal  policy  in  that  game  for  high  school  players  who  were  playing  with  him .PERIOD so  the  team  that  was  the  poorest  had  gotten  even  poorer .PERIOD there  was  no  way  they  could  win .PERIOD and  we  were  approaching  four  o'clock ,COMMA our  cut-off  time ,COMMA there  was  about  a  minute  left ,COMMA and  despair  just  settled  over  the  room .PERIOD i  thought ,COMMA i  'm  failing  as  a  teacher .PERIOD i  should  have  gotten  it  so  they  could  have  won .PERIOD they  should  n't  be  failing  like  this .PERIOD i've  failed  them .PERIOD and  i  was  just  feeling  so  sad  and  dejected .PERIOD and  suddenly ,COMMA brennan  walked  over  to  my  chair  and  he  grabbed  the  bell ,COMMA the  bell  i  ring  to  signal  a  change  or  a  reconvening  of  cabinets ,COMMA and  he  ran  back  to  his  seat ,COMMA rang  the  bell .PERIOD everybody  ran  to  his  chair ,COMMA there  was  screaming .PERIOD there  was  yelling ,COMMA waving  of  their  dossiers .PERIOD they  get  these  dossiers  full  of  secret  documents .PERIOD they  were  gesticulating .PERIOD they  were  running  around .PERIOD i  did  n't  know  what  they  were  doing .PERIOD i'd  lost  control  of  my  classroom .PERIOD principal  walks  in ,COMMA i  'm  out  of  a  job .PERIOD the  parents  were  looking  in  the  window .PERIOD and  brennan  runs  back  to  his  seat .PERIOD everybody  runs  back  to  their  seat .PERIOD he  rings  the  bell  again .PERIOD he  says ,COMMA we  have ,COMMA and  there  's  12  seconds  left  on  the  clock ,COMMA we  have ,COMMA all  nations ,COMMA pooled  all  our  funds  together .PERIOD and  we've  got  600  billion  dollars .PERIOD we  're  going  to  offer  it  as  a  donation  to  this  poor  country .PERIOD and  if  they  accept  it ,COMMA it  'll  raise  their  asset  value  and  we  can  win  the  game .PERIOD will  you  accept  it ?QUESTIONMARK and  there  are  three  seconds  left  on  the  clock .PERIOD everybody  looks  at  this  prime  minister  of  that  country ,COMMA and  he  says ,COMMA yes .PERIOD and  the  game  is  won .PERIOD spontaneous  compassion  that  could  not  be  planned  for ,COMMA that  was  unexpected  and  unpredictable .PERIOD every  game  we  play  is  different .PERIOD some  games  are  more  about  social  issues ,COMMA some  are  more  about  economic  issues .PERIOD some  games  are  more  about  warfare .PERIOD but  i  do  n't  try  to  deny  them  that  reality  of  being  human .PERIOD i  allow  them  to  go  there  and ,COMMA through  their  own  experience ,COMMA learn ,COMMA in  a  bloodless  way ,COMMA how  not  to  do  what  they  consider  to  be  the  wrong  thing .PERIOD and  they  find  out  what  is  right  their  own  way ,COMMA their  own  selves .PERIOD and  so  in  this  game ,COMMA i've  learned  so  much  from  it ,COMMA but  i  would  say  that  if  only  they  could  pick  up  a  critical  thinking  tool  or  creative  thinking  tool  from  this  game  and  leverage  something  good  for  the  world ,COMMA they  may  save  us  all .PERIOD if  only .PERIOD and  on  behalf  of  all  of  my  teachers  on  whose  shoulders  i  'm  standing ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD we  live  in  difficult  and  challenging  economic  times ,COMMA of  course .PERIOD and  one  of  the  first  victims  of  difficult  economic  times ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA is  public  spending  of  any  kind ,COMMA but  certainly  in  the  firing  line  at  the  moment  is  public  spending  for  science ,COMMA and  particularly  curiosity-led  science  and  exploration .PERIOD so  i  want  to  try  and  convince  you  in  about  15  minutes  that  that  's  a  ridiculous  and  ludicrous  thing  to  do .PERIOD but  i  think  to  set  the  scene ,COMMA i  want  to  show ,COMMA the  next  slide  is  not  my  attempt  to  show  the  worst  ted  slide  in  the  history  of  ted ,COMMA but  it  is  a  bit  of  a  mess .PERIOD but  actually ,COMMA it  's  not  my  fault .PERIOD it  's  from  the  guardian  newspaper .PERIOD and  it  's  actually  a  beautiful  demonstration  of  how  much  science  costs .PERIOD because ,COMMA if  i  'm  going  to  make  the  case  for  continuing  to  spend  on  curiosity-driven  science  and  exploration ,COMMA i  should  tell  you  how  much  it  costs .PERIOD so  this  is  a  game  called  spot  the  science  budgets .PERIOD this  is  the  uk .PERIOD government  spend .PERIOD you  see  there ,COMMA it  's  about  620  billion  a  year .PERIOD the  science  budget  is  actually ,COMMA if  you  look  to  your  left ,COMMA there  's  a  purple  set  of  blobs  and  then  yellow  set  of  blobs .PERIOD and  it  's  one  of  the  yellow  set  of  blobs  around  the  big  yellow  blob .PERIOD it  's  about  33  billion  pounds  per  year  out  of  620  billion .PERIOD that  funds  everything  in  the  uk .PERIOD from  medical  research ,COMMA space  exploration ,COMMA where  i  work ,COMMA at  cern  in  geneva ,COMMA particle  physics ,COMMA engineering ,COMMA even  arts  and  humanities ,COMMA funded  from  the  science  budget ,COMMA which  is  that  33  billion ,COMMA that  little ,COMMA tiny  yellow  blob  around  the  orange  blob  at  the  top  left  of  the  screen .PERIOD so  that  's  what  we  're  arguing  about .PERIOD that  percentage ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA is  about  the  same  in  the  us .PERIOD and  germany  and  france .PERIOD r&ampd  in  total  in  the  economy ,COMMA publicly  funded ,COMMA is  about  06  percent  of  gdp .PERIOD so  that  's  what  we  're  arguing  about .PERIOD the  first  thing  i  want  to  say ,COMMA and  this  is  straight  from  wonders  of  the  solar  system ,COMMA is  that  our  exploration  of  the  solar  system  and  the  universe  has  shown  us  that  it  is  indescribably  beautiful .PERIOD this  is  a  picture  that  actually  was  sent  back  by  the  cassini  space  probe  around  saturn ,COMMA after  we'd  finished  filming  wonders  of  the  solar  system .PERIOD so  it  is  n't  in  the  series .PERIOD it  's  of  the  moon  enceladus .PERIOD so  that  big  sweeping ,COMMA white  sphere  in  the  corner  is  saturn ,COMMA which  is  actually  in  the  background  of  the  picture .PERIOD and  that  crescent  there  is  the  moon  enceladus ,COMMA which  is  about  as  big  as  the  british  isles .PERIOD it  's  about  500  kilometers  in  diameter .PERIOD so ,COMMA tiny  moon .PERIOD what  's  fascinating  and  beautiful .PERIOD this  an  unprocessed  picture ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA i  should  say .PERIOD it  's  black  and  white ,COMMA straight  from  saturnian  orbit .PERIOD what  's  beautiful  is ,COMMA you  can  probably  see  on  the  limb  there  some  faint ,COMMA sort  of ,COMMA wisps  of  almost  smoke  rising  up  from  the  limb .PERIOD this  is  how  we  visualize  that  in  wonders  of  the  solar  system .PERIOD it  's  a  beautiful  graphic .PERIOD what  we  found  out  were  that  those  faint  wisps  are  actually  fountains  of  ice  rising  up  from  the  surface  of  this  tiny  moon .PERIOD that  's  fascinating  and  beautiful  in  itself ,COMMA but  we  think  that  the  mechanism  for  powering  those  fountains  requires  there  to  be  lakes  of  liquid  water  beneath  the  surface  of  this  moon .PERIOD and  what  's  important  about  that  is  that ,COMMA on  our  planet ,COMMA on  earth ,COMMA wherever  we  find  liquid  water ,COMMA we  find  life .PERIOD so ,COMMA to  find  strong  evidence  of  liquid ,COMMA pools  of  liquid ,COMMA beneath  the  surface  of  a  moon  750  million  miles  away  from  the  earth  is  really  quite  astounding .PERIOD so  what  we  're  saying ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA is  maybe  that  's  a  habitat  for  life  in  the  solar  system .PERIOD well ,COMMA let  me  just  say ,COMMA that  was  a  graphic .PERIOD i  just  want  to  show  this  picture .PERIOD that  's  one  more  picture  of  enceladus .PERIOD this  is  when  cassini  flew  beneath  enceladus .PERIOD so  it  made  a  very  low  pass ,COMMA just  a  few  hundred  kilometers  above  the  surface .PERIOD and  so  this ,COMMA again ,COMMA a  real  picture  of  the  ice  fountains  rising  up  into  space ,COMMA absolutely  beautiful .PERIOD but  that  's  not  the  prime  candidate  for  life  in  the  solar  system .PERIOD that  's  probably  this  place ,COMMA which  is  a  moon  of  jupiter ,COMMA europa .PERIOD and  again ,COMMA we  had  to  fly  to  the  jovian  system  to  get  any  sense  that  this  moon ,COMMA as  most  moons ,COMMA was  anything  other  than  a  dead  ball  of  rock .PERIOD it  's  actually  an  ice  moon .PERIOD so  what  you  're  looking  at  is  the  surface  of  the  moon  europa ,COMMA which  is  a  thick  sheet  of  ice ,COMMA probably  a  hundred  kilometers  thick .PERIOD but  by  measuring  the  way  that  europa  interacts  with  the  magnetic  field  of  jupiter ,COMMA and  looking  at  how  those  cracks  in  the  ice  that  you  can  see  there  on  that  graphic  move  around ,COMMA we've  inferred  very  strongly  that  there  's  an  ocean  of  liquid  surrounding  the  entire  surface  of  europa .PERIOD so  below  the  ice ,COMMA there  's  an  ocean  of  liquid  around  the  whole  moon .PERIOD it  could  be  hundreds  of  kilometers  deep ,COMMA we  think .PERIOD we  think  it  's  saltwater ,COMMA and  that  would  mean  that  there  's  more  water  on  that  moon  of  jupiter  than  there  is  in  all  the  oceans  of  the  earth  combined .PERIOD so  that  place ,COMMA a  little  moon  around  jupiter ,COMMA is  probably  the  prime  candidate  for  finding  life  on  a  moon  or  a  body  outside  the  earth ,COMMA that  we  know  of .PERIOD tremendous  and  beautiful  discovery .PERIOD our  exploration  of  the  solar  system  has  taught  us  that  the  solar  system  is  beautiful .PERIOD it  may  also  have  pointed  the  way  to  answering  one  of  the  most  profound  questions  that  you  can  possibly  ask ,COMMA which  is ,COMMA are  we  alone  in  the  universe ?QUESTIONMARK is  there  any  other  use  to  exploration  and  science ,COMMA other  than  just  a  sense  of  wonder ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA there  is .PERIOD this  is  a  very  famous  picture  taken ,COMMA actually ,COMMA on  my  first  christmas  eve ,COMMA december  24th ,COMMA 1968 ,COMMA when  i  was  about  eight  months  old .PERIOD it  was  taken  by  apollo  8  as  it  went  around  the  back  of  the  moon .PERIOD earthrise  from  apollo  8 .PERIOD a  famous  picture .PERIOD many  people  have  said  that  it  's  the  picture  that  saved  1968 ,COMMA which  was  a  turbulent  year ,COMMA the  student  riots  in  paris ,COMMA the  height  of  the  vietnam  war .PERIOD the  reason  many  people  think  that  about  this  picture ,COMMA and  al  gore  has  said  it  many  times ,COMMA actually ,COMMA on  the  stage  at  ted ,COMMA is  that  this  picture ,COMMA arguably ,COMMA was  the  beginning  of  the  environmental  movement .PERIOD because ,COMMA for  the  first  time ,COMMA we  saw  our  world ,COMMA not  as  a  solid ,COMMA immovable ,COMMA but  as  a  very  small ,COMMA fragile-looking  world  just  hanging  against  the  blackness  of  space .PERIOD what  's  also  not  often  said  about  the  space  exploration ,COMMA about  the  apollo  program ,COMMA is  the  economic  contribution  it  made .PERIOD i  mean  while  you  can  make  arguments  that  it  was  wonderful  and  a  tremendous  achievement  and  delivered  pictures  like  this ,COMMA it  cost  a  lot ,COMMA did  n't  it ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA actually ,COMMA many  studies  have  been  done  about  the  economic  effectiveness ,COMMA the  economic  impact  of  apollo .PERIOD the  biggest  one  was  in  1975  by  chase  econometrics .PERIOD and  it  showed  that  for  every  $1  spent  on  apollo ,COMMA 14  came  back  into  the  us .PERIOD economy .PERIOD so  the  apollo  program  paid  for  itself  in  inspiration ,COMMA in  engineering ,COMMA achievement  and ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA in  inspiring  young  scientists  and  engineers  14  times  over .PERIOD so  exploration  can  pay  for  itself .PERIOD what  about  scientific  discovery ?QUESTIONMARK what  about  driving  innovation ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA this  looks  like  a  picture  of  virtually  nothing .PERIOD what  it  is ,COMMA is  a  picture  of  the  spectrum  of  hydrogen .PERIOD see ,COMMA back  in  the  1880s ,COMMA 1890s ,COMMA many  scientists ,COMMA many  observers ,COMMA looked  at  the  light  given  off  from  atoms .PERIOD and  they  saw  strange  pictures  like  this .PERIOD what  you  're  seeing  when  you  put  it  through  a  prism  is  that  you  heat  hydrogen  up  and  it  does  n't  just  glow  like  a  white  light ,COMMA it  just  emits  light  at  particular  colors ,COMMA a  red  one ,COMMA a  light  blue  one ,COMMA some  dark  blue  ones .PERIOD now  that  led  to  an  understanding  of  atomic  structure  because  the  way  that  's  explained  is  atoms  are  a  single  nucleus  with  electrons  going  around  them .PERIOD and  the  electrons  can  only  be  in  particular  places .PERIOD and  when  they  jump  up  to  the  next  place  they  can  be ,COMMA and  fall  back  down  again ,COMMA they  emit  light  at  particular  colors .PERIOD and  so  the  fact  that  atoms ,COMMA when  you  heat  them  up ,COMMA only  emit  light  at  very  specific  colors ,COMMA was  one  of  the  key  drivers  that  led  to  the  development  of  the  quantum  theory ,COMMA the  theory  of  the  structure  of  atoms .PERIOD i  just  wanted  to  show  this  picture  because  this  is  remarkable .PERIOD this  is  actually  a  picture  of  the  spectrum  of  the  sun .PERIOD and  now ,COMMA this  is  a  picture  of  atoms  in  the  sun  's  atmosphere  absorbing  light .PERIOD and  again ,COMMA they  only  absorb  light  at  particular  colors  when  electrons  jump  up  and  fall  down ,COMMA jump  up  and  fall  down .PERIOD but  look  at  the  number  of  black  lines  in  that  spectrum .PERIOD and  the  element  helium  was  discovered  just  by  staring  at  the  light  from  the  sun  because  some  of  those  black  lines  were  found  that  corresponded  to  no  known  element .PERIOD and  that  's  why  helium  's  called  helium .PERIOD it  's  called  helios ,COMMA helios  from  the  sun .PERIOD now ,COMMA that  sounds  esoteric ,COMMA and  indeed  it  was  an  esoteric  pursuit ,COMMA but  the  quantum  theory  quickly  led  to  an  understanding  of  the  behaviors  of  electrons  in  materials  like  silicon ,COMMA for  example .PERIOD the  way  that  silicon  behaves ,COMMA the  fact  that  you  can  build  transistors ,COMMA is  a  purely  quantum  phenomenon .PERIOD so  without  that  curiosity-driven  understanding  of  the  structure  of  atoms ,COMMA which  led  to  this  rather  esoteric  theory ,COMMA quantum  mechanics ,COMMA then  we  would  n't  have  transistors ,COMMA we  would  n't  have  silicon  chips ,COMMA we  would  n't  have  pretty  much  the  basis  of  our  modern  economy .PERIOD there  's  one  more ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA wonderful  twist  to  that  tale .PERIOD in  wonders  of  the  solar  system ,COMMA we  kept  emphasizing  the  laws  of  physics  are  universal .PERIOD it  's  one  of  the  most  incredible  things  about  the  physics  and  the  understanding  of  nature  that  you  get  on  earth ,COMMA is  you  can  transport  it ,COMMA not  only  to  the  planets ,COMMA but  to  the  most  distant  stars  and  galaxies .PERIOD and  one  of  the  astonishing  predictions  of  quantum  mechanics ,COMMA just  by  looking  at  the  structure  of  atoms ,COMMA the  same  theory  that  describes  transistors ,COMMA is  that  there  can  be  no  stars  in  the  universe  that  have  reached  the  end  of  their  life  that  are  bigger  than ,COMMA quite  specifically ,COMMA 14  times  the  mass  of  the  sun .PERIOD that  's  a  limit  imposed  on  the  mass  of  stars .PERIOD you  can  work  it  out  on  a  piece  of  paper  in  a  laboratory ,COMMA get  a  telescope ,COMMA swing  it  to  the  sky ,COMMA and  you  find  that  there  are  no  dead  stars  bigger  than  14  times  the  mass  of  the  sun .PERIOD that  's  quite  an  incredible  prediction .PERIOD what  happens  when  you  have  a  star  that  's  right  on  the  edge  of  that  mass ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA this  is  a  picture  of  it .PERIOD this  is  the  picture  of  a  galaxy ,COMMA a  common  our  garden  galaxy  with ,COMMA what ,COMMA 100  billion  stars  like  our  sun  in  it .PERIOD it  's  just  one  of  billions  of  galaxies  in  the  universe .PERIOD there  are  a  billion  stars  in  the  galactic  core ,COMMA which  is  why  it  's  shining  out  so  brightly .PERIOD this  is  about  50  million  light  years  away ,COMMA so  one  of  our  neighboring  galaxies .PERIOD but  that  bright  star  there  is  actually  one  of  the  stars  in  the  galaxy .PERIOD so  that  star  is  also  50  million  light  years  away .PERIOD it  's  part  of  that  galaxy ,COMMA and  it  's  shining  as  brightly  as  the  center  of  the  galaxy  with  a  billion  suns  in  it .PERIOD that  's  a  type  ia  supernova  explosion .PERIOD now  that  's  an  incredible  phenomena ,COMMA because  it  's  a  star  that  sits  there .PERIOD it  's  called  a  carbon-oxygen  dwarf .PERIOD it  sits  there  about ,COMMA say ,COMMA 13  times  the  mass  of  the  sun .PERIOD and  it  has  a  binary  companion  that  goes  around  it ,COMMA so  a  big  star ,COMMA a  big  ball  of  gas .PERIOD and  what  it  does  is  it  sucks  gas  off  its  companion  star ,COMMA until  it  gets  to  this  limit  called  the  chandrasekhar  limit ,COMMA and  then  it  explodes .PERIOD and  it  explodes ,COMMA and  it  shines  as  brightly  as  a  billion  suns  for  about  two  weeks ,COMMA and  releases ,COMMA not  only  energy ,COMMA but  a  huge  amount  of  chemical  elements  into  the  universe .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA that  one  is  a  carbon-oxygen  dwarf .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  was  no  carbon  and  oxygen  in  the  universe  at  the  big  bang .PERIOD and  there  was  no  carbon  and  oxygen  in  the  universe  throughout  the  first  generation  of  stars .PERIOD it  was  made  in  stars  like  that ,COMMA locked  away  and  then  returned  to  the  universe  in  explosions  like  that  in  order  to  recondense  into  planets ,COMMA stars ,COMMA new  solar  systems  and ,COMMA indeed ,COMMA people  like  us .PERIOD i  think  that  's  a  remarkable  demonstration  of  the  power  and  beauty  and  universality  of  the  laws  of  physics ,COMMA because  we  understand  that  process ,COMMA because  we  understand  the  structure  of  atoms  here  on  earth .PERIOD this  is  a  beautiful  quote  that  i  found ,COMMA we  're  talking  about  serendipity  there ,COMMA from  alexander  fleming: .PERIOD when  i  woke  up  just  after  dawn  on  september  28 ,COMMA 1928 ,COMMA i  certainly  did  n't  plan  to  revolutionize  all  medicine  by  discovering  the  world  's  first  antibiotic .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  explorers  of  the  world  of  the  atom  did  not  intend  to  invent  the  transistor .PERIOD and  they  certainly  did  n't  intend  to  describe  the  mechanics  of  supernova  explosions ,COMMA which  eventually  told  us  where  the  building  blocks  of  life  were  synthesized  in  the  universe .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  think  science  can  be ,COMMA serendipity  is  important .PERIOD it  can  be  beautiful .PERIOD it  can  reveal  quite  astonishing  things .PERIOD it  can  also ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA finally  reveal  the  most  profound  ideas  to  us  about  our  place  in  the  universe  and  really  the  value  of  our  home  planet .PERIOD this  is  a  spectacular  picture  of  our  home  planet .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  does  n't  look  like  our  home  planet .PERIOD it  looks  like  saturn  because ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA it  is .PERIOD it  was  taken  by  the  cassini  space  probe .PERIOD but  it  's  a  famous  picture ,COMMA not  because  of  the  beauty  and  majesty  of  saturn  's  rings ,COMMA but  actually  because  of  a  tiny ,COMMA faint  blob  just  hanging  underneath  one  of  the  rings .PERIOD and  if  i  blow  it  up  there ,COMMA you  see  it .PERIOD it  looks  like  a  moon ,COMMA but  in  fact ,COMMA it  's  a  picture  of  earth .PERIOD it  was  a  picture  of  earth  captured  in  that  frame  of  saturn .PERIOD that  's  our  planet  from  750  million  miles  away .PERIOD i  think  the  earth  has  got  a  strange  property  that  the  farther  away  you  get  from  it ,COMMA the  more  beautiful  it  seems .PERIOD but  that  is  not  the  most  distant  or  most  famous  picture  of  our  planet .PERIOD it  was  taken  by  this  thing ,COMMA which  is  called  the  voyager  spacecraft .PERIOD and  that  's  a  picture  of  me  in  front  of  it  for  scale .PERIOD the  voyager  is  a  tiny  machine .PERIOD it  's  currently  10  billion  miles  away  from  earth ,COMMA transmitting  with  that  dish ,COMMA with  the  power  of  20  watts ,COMMA and  we  're  still  in  contact  with  it .PERIOD but  it  visited  jupiter ,COMMA saturn ,COMMA uranus  and  neptune .PERIOD and  after  it  visited  all  four  of  those  planets ,COMMA carl  sagan ,COMMA who  's  one  of  my  great  heroes ,COMMA had  the  wonderful  idea  of  turning  voyager  around  and  taking  a  picture  of  every  planet  it  had  visited .PERIOD and  it  took  this  picture  of  earth .PERIOD now  it  's  very  hard  to  see  the  earth  there ,COMMA it  's  called  the  pale  blue  dot  picture ,COMMA but  earth  is  suspended  in  that  red  shaft  of  light .PERIOD that  's  earth  from  four  billion  miles  away .PERIOD and  i'd  like  to  read  you  what  sagan  wrote  about  it ,COMMA just  to  finish ,COMMA because  i  cannot  say  words  as  beautiful  as  this  to  describe  what  he  saw  in  that  picture  that  he  had  taken .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA consider  again

was  our  job ,COMMA apparently ,COMMA to  help .PERIOD this  is  what  jesus  asked  of  us .PERIOD and  then  he  said ,COMMA what  you  do  for  the  least  of  these ,COMMA you  do  for  me  now  i  was  pretty  psyched .PERIOD i  was  very  eager  to  be  useful  in  the  world  -- .PERIOD i  think  we  all  have  that  feeling .PERIOD and  also ,COMMA it  was  kind  of  interesting  that  god  needed  help .PERIOD that  was  news  to  me ,COMMA and  it  felt  like  it  was  a  very  important  thing  to  get  to  participate  in .PERIOD but  i  also  learned  very  soon  thereafter  that  jesus  also  said ,COMMA and  i  'm  paraphrasing ,COMMA the  poor  would  always  be  with  us .PERIOD this  frustrated  and  confused  me .PERIOD i  felt  like  i  had  been  just  given  a  homework  assignment  that  i  had  to  do ,COMMA and  i  was  excited  to  do ,COMMA but  no  matter  what  i  would  do ,COMMA i  would  fail .PERIOD so  i  felt  confused ,COMMA a  little  bit  frustrated  and  angry ,COMMA like  maybe  i'd  misunderstood  something  here .PERIOD and  i  felt  overwhelmed .PERIOD and  for  the  first  time ,COMMA i  began  to  fear  this  group  of  people

would  always  be  with  us .PERIOD they  were  always  going  to  ask  me  to  help  them  and  give  them  things ,COMMA which  i  was  excited  to  do ,COMMA but  i  did  n't  know  how  it  was

 kind  of  related .PERIOD and  in  general ,COMMA i  got  this  sort  of  idea  that  the  poor  in  the  world  lived  lives  that  were  wrought  with  suffering  and  sadness ,COMMA devastation ,COMMA hopelessness .PERIOD and  after  a  while ,COMMA i  developed  what  i  think  many  of  us  do ,COMMA is  this  predictable  response ,COMMA where  i  started  to  feel  bad  every  time  i

when  it  was  difficult  to  avoid .PERIOD and  i  gave ,COMMA in  general ,COMMA when  the  negative  emotions  built  up  enough  that  i  gave  to  relieve  my  own  suffering ,COMMA not  someone  else  's .PERIOD the  truth  be  told ,COMMA i  was  giving  out  of  that  place ,COMMA not  out  of  a  genuine  place  of  hope  and  excitement  to  help  and  of  generosity .PERIOD it  became  a

 into  a  commodity .PERIOD which  is  a  very  scary  thing .PERIOD so  as  i  did  this ,COMMA and  as  i  think  many  of  us  do  this ,COMMA we  kind  of  buy  our  distance ,COMMA we  kind  of  buy  our  right  to  go  on  with  our  day .PERIOD i  think  that  exchange  can  actually  get  in  the  way  of  the  very  thing  that  we  want  most .PERIOD it  can  get  in  the  way  of  our

years  before  that .PERIOD but  basically ,COMMA microfinance ,COMMA if  this  is  new  to  you  as  well ,COMMA think  of  that  as  financial  services  for  the  poor .PERIOD think  of  all  the  things  you  get  at  your  bank  and  imagine  those  products  and  services  tailored  to  the  needs  of  someone  living  on  a  few  dollars  a  day .PERIOD dr.  yunus  shared  his  story ,COMMA explaining  what  that  was ,COMMA and  what  he  had  done  with  his  grameen  bank .PERIOD he  also  talked  about ,COMMA in  particular ,COMMA microlending .PERIOD which  is  a  tiny  loan  that  could  help  someone  start  or  grow  a  business .PERIOD now ,COMMA when  i  heard  him  speak ,COMMA it  was  exciting  for  a  number  of  reasons .PERIOD first  and  foremost ,COMMA i  learned  about  this  new  method  of  change  in  the  world  that ,COMMA for  once ,COMMA showed  me ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA a  way  to  interact  with  someone  and  to  give ,COMMA to  share  of  a  resource  in  a  way  that  was  n't  weird  and  did  n't  make  me  feel  bad  -- .PERIOD that  was  exciting .PERIOD but  more  importantly ,COMMA he  told  stories  about  the  poor  that  were  different  than  any  stories  i  had  heard  before .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA those  individuals  he  talked  about  who  were  poor  was  sort  of  a  side  note .PERIOD he  was  talking  about  strong ,COMMA smart ,COMMA hardworking  entrepreneurs  who  woke  up  every  day  and  were  doing  things  to  make  their  lives  and  their  family  's  lives  better .PERIOD all  they  needed  to  do  that  more  quickly  and  to  do  it  better  was  a  little  bit  of  capital .PERIOD it  was  an  amazing  sort  of  insight  for  me .PERIOD and  i ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA was  so  deeply  moved  by  this ,COMMA it  's  hard  to  express  now  how  much  that  affected  me ,COMMA but  i  was  so  moved  that  i  actually  quit  my  job  a  few  weeks  later ,COMMA and  i  moved  to  east  africa  to  try  to  see  for  myself  what  this  was  about .PERIOD for  the  first  time ,COMMA actually ,COMMA in  a  long  time  i  wanted  to  meet  those  individuals ,COMMA i  wanted  to  meet  these  entrepreneurs ,COMMA and  see  for  myself  what  their  lives  were  actually  about .PERIOD so  i  spent  three  months  in  kenya ,COMMA uganda  and  tanzania  interviewing  entrepreneurs  that  had  received  100  dollars  to  start  or  grow  a  business .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA through  those  interactions ,COMMA for  the  first  time ,COMMA i  was  starting  to  get  to  be  friends  with  some  of  those  people  in  that  big  amorphous  group  out  there  that  was  supposed  to  be  far  away .PERIOD i  was  starting  to  be  friends  and  get  to  know  their  personal  stories .PERIOD and  over  and  over  again ,COMMA as  i  interviewed  them  and  spent  my  days  with  them ,COMMA i  did  hear  stories  of  life  change  and  amazing  little  details  of  change .PERIOD so  i  would  hear  from  goat  herders  who  had  used  that  money  that  they  had  received  to  buy  a  few  more  goats .PERIOD their  business  trajectory  would  change .PERIOD they  would  make  a  little  bit  more  money .PERIOD their  standard  of  living  would  shift  and  would  get  better .PERIOD and  they  would  make  really  interesting  little  adjustments  in  their  lives ,COMMA like  they  would  start  to  send  their  children  to  school .PERIOD they  might  be  able  to  buy  mosquito  nets .PERIOD maybe  they  could  afford  a  lock  for  the  door  and  feel  secure .PERIOD maybe  it  was  just  that  they  could  put  sugar  in  their  tea  and  offer  that  to  me  when  i  came  as  their  guest  and  that  made  them  feel  proud .PERIOD but  there  were  these  beautiful  details ,COMMA even  if  i  talked  to  20  goat  herders  in  a  row ,COMMA and  some  days  that  's  what  happened ,COMMA these  beautiful  details  of  life  change  that  were  meaningful  to  them .PERIOD that  was  another  thing  that  really  touched  me .PERIOD it  was  really  humbling  to  see  for  the  first  time ,COMMA to  really  understand  that  even  if  i  could  have  taken  a  magic  wand  and  fixed  everything ,COMMA i  probably  would  have  gotten  a  lot  wrong .PERIOD because  the  best  way  for  people  to  change  their  lives  is  for  them  to  have  control  and  to  do  that  in  a  way  that  they  believe  is  best  for  them .PERIOD so  i  saw  that  and  it  was  very  humbling .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA another  interesting  thing  happened  while  i  was  there .PERIOD i  never  once  was  asked  for  a  donation ,COMMA which  had  kind  of  been  my  mode ,COMMA right .PERIOD there  's  poverty ,COMMA you  give  money  to  help  -- .PERIOD no  one  asked  me  for  a  donation .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA no  one  wanted  me  to  feel  bad  for  them  at  all .PERIOD if  anything ,COMMA they  just  wanted  to  be  able  to  do  more  of  what  they  were  doing  already  and  to  build  on  their  own  capabilities .PERIOD so  what  i  did  hear ,COMMA once  in  a  while ,COMMA was  that  people  wanted  a  loan ,COMMA i  thought  that  sounded  very  reasonable  and  really  exciting .PERIOD and  by  the  way ,COMMA i  was  a  philosophy  and  poetry  major  in  school ,COMMA so  i  did  n't  know  the  difference  between  profit  and  revenue  when  i  went  to  east  africa .PERIOD i  just  got  this  impression  that  the  money  would  work .PERIOD and  my  introduction  to  business  was  in  these  $100  little  infuses  of  capital .PERIOD and  i  learned  about  profit  and  revenue ,COMMA about  leverage ,COMMA all  sorts  of  things ,COMMA from  farmers ,COMMA from  seamstresses ,COMMA from  goat  herders .PERIOD so  this  idea  that  these  new  stories  of  business  and  hope  might  be  shared  with  my  friends  and  family ,COMMA and  through  that ,COMMA maybe  we  could  get  some  of  the  money  that  they  needed  to  be  able  to  continue  their  businesses  as  loans ,COMMA that  's  this  little  idea  that  turned  into  kiva .PERIOD a  few  months  later ,COMMA i  went  back  to  uganda  with  a  digital  camera  and  a  basic  website  that  my  partner ,COMMA matthew ,COMMA and  i  had  kind  of  built .PERIOD and  took  pictures  of  seven  of  my  new  friends ,COMMA posted  their  stories ,COMMA these  stories  of  entrepreneurship ,COMMA up  on  the  website ,COMMA spammed  friends  and  family  and  said ,COMMA we  think  this  is  legal .PERIOD have  n't  heard  back  yet  from  sec  on  all  the  details ,COMMA but  do  you  say ,COMMA do  you  want  to  help  participate  in  this .PERIOD provide  the  money  that  they  need ?QUESTIONMARK the  money  came  in  basically  overnight .PERIOD we  sent  it  over  to  uganda .PERIOD and  over  the  next  six  months ,COMMA a  beautiful  thing  happened .PERIOD the  entrepreneurs  received  the  money ,COMMA they  were  paid ,COMMA and  their  businesses ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA grew ,COMMA and  they  were  able  to  support  themselves  and  change  the  trajectory  of  their  lives .PERIOD in  october  of  05 ,COMMA after  those  first  seven  loans  were  paid ,COMMA matt  and  i  took  the  word  beta  off  of  the  site .PERIOD we  said ,COMMA our  little  experiment  has  been  a  success .PERIOD let  's  start  for  real  that  was  our  official  launch .PERIOD and  then  that  first  year ,COMMA october  05  through  06 ,COMMA kiva  facilitated  $500,000  in  loans .PERIOD the  second  year ,COMMA it  was  a  total  of  15  million .PERIOD the  third  year ,COMMA the  total  was  up  to  around  40 .PERIOD the  fourth  year ,COMMA we  were  just  short  of  100 .PERIOD and  today ,COMMA less  than  five  years  in ,COMMA kiva  's  facilitated  more  than  150  million  dollars ,COMMA in  little  25-dollar  bits ,COMMA from  lenders  and  entrepreneurs ,COMMA more  than  a  million  of  those ,COMMA collectively  in  200  countries .PERIOD so  that  's  where  kiva  is  today ,COMMA just  to  bring  you  right  up  to  the  present .PERIOD and  while  those  numbers  and  those  statistics  to  me ,COMMA kiva  's  really  about  stories .PERIOD it  's  about  retelling  the  story  of  the  poor ,COMMA and  it  's  about  giving  ourselves  an  opportunity  to  engage  that  validates  their  dignity ,COMMA validates  a  partnership  relationship ,COMMA not  a  relationship  that  's  based  on  the  traditional  sort  of  donor  beneficiary  weirdness  that  can  happen .PERIOD but  instead  a  relationship  that  can  promote  respect  and  hope  and  this  optimism  that  together  we  can  move  forward .PERIOD so  what  i  hope  is  that ,COMMA not  only  can  the  money  keep  flowing  forth  through  kiva ,COMMA that  's  a  very  positive  and  meaningful  thing ,COMMA but  i  hope  kiva  can  blur  those  lines ,COMMA like  i  said ,COMMA between  the  traditional  rich  and  poor  categories  that  we  're  taught  to  see  in  the  world ,COMMA this  false  dichotomy  of  us  and  them ,COMMA have  and  have  not .PERIOD i  hope  that  kiva  can  blur  those  lines .PERIOD because  as  that  happens ,COMMA i  think  we  can  feel  free  to  interact  in  a  way  that  's  more  open ,COMMA more  just  and  more  creative ,COMMA to  engage  with  each  other  and  to  help  each  other .PERIOD imagine  how  you  feel  when  you  see  somebody  on  street  who  is  begging  and  you  're  about  to  approach  them .PERIOD imagine  how  you  feel .PERIOD and  then  imagine  the  difference  when  you  might  see  somebody  who  has  a  story  of  entrepreneurship  and  hard  work  who  wants  to  tell  you  about  their  business .PERIOD maybe  they  're  smiling ,COMMA and  they  want  to  talk  to  you  about  what  they've  done .PERIOD imagine  if  you  're  speaking  with  somebody  who  's  growing  things  and  making  them  flourish ,COMMA somebody  who  's  using  their  talents  to  do  something  productive ,COMMA somebody  who  's  built  their  own  business  from  scratch ,COMMA someone  who  is  surrounded  by  abundance ,COMMA not  scarcity ,COMMA who  's  in  fact  creating  abundance ,COMMA somebody  with  full  hands  with  something  to  offer ,COMMA not  empty  hands  asking  for  you  to  give  them  something .PERIOD imagine  if  you  could  hear  a  story  you  did  n't  expect  of  somebody  who  wakes  up  every  day  and  works  very ,COMMA very  hard  to  make  their  life  better .PERIOD these  stories  can  really  change  the  way  that  we  think  about  each  other .PERIOD and  if  we  can  catalyze  a  supportive  community  to  come  around  these  individuals  and  to  participate  in  their  story  by  lending  a  little  bit  of  money ,COMMA i  think  that  can  change  the  way  we  believe  in  each  other  and  each  other  's  potential .PERIOD now  for  me ,COMMA kiva  is  just  the  beginning .PERIOD and  as  i  look  forward  to  what  is  next .PERIOD it  's  been  helpful  to  reflect  on  the  things  i've  learned  so  far .PERIOD the  first  one  is ,COMMA as  i  mentioned ,COMMA entrepreneurship  was  a  new  idea  to  me .PERIOD kiva  borrowers ,COMMA as  i  interviewed  them  and  got  to  know  them  over  the  last  few  years ,COMMA have  taught  me  what  entrepreneurship  is .PERIOD and  i  think ,COMMA at  its  core ,COMMA it  's  deciding  that  you  want  your  life  to  be  better .PERIOD you  see  an  opportunity  and  you  decide  what  you  're  going  to  do  to  try  to  seize  that .PERIOD in  short ,COMMA it  's  deciding  that  tomorrow  can  better  than  today  and  going  after  that .PERIOD second  thing  that  i've  learned  is  that  loans  are  a  very  interesting  tool  for  connectivity .PERIOD so  they  're  not  a  donation .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA maybe  it  does  n't  sound  that  much  different .PERIOD but  in  fact ,COMMA when  you  give  something  to  someone  and  they  say ,COMMA thanks ,COMMA and  let  you  know  how  things  go ,COMMA that  's  one  thing .PERIOD when  you  lend  them  money ,COMMA and  they  slowly  pay  you  back  over  time ,COMMA you  have  this  excuse  to  have  an  ongoing  dialogue .PERIOD this  continued  attention ,COMMA this  ongoing  attention ,COMMA is  a  really  big  deal  to  build  different  kinds  of  relationships  among  us .PERIOD and  then  third ,COMMA from  what  i've  heard  from  the  entrepreneurs  i've  gotten  to  know ,COMMA when  all  else  is  equal ,COMMA given  the  option  to  have  just  money  to  do  what  you  need  to  do ,COMMA or  money  plus  the  support  and  encouragement  of  a  global  community ,COMMA people  choose  the  community  plus  the  money .PERIOD that  's  a  much  more  meaningful  combination ,COMMA a  more  powerful  combination .PERIOD so  with  that  in  mind ,COMMA this  particular  incident  has  led  to  the  things  that  i  'm  working  on  now .PERIOD i  see  entrepreneurs  everywhere  now ,COMMA now  that  i  'm  tuned  into  this .PERIOD and  one  thing  that  i've  seen  is  there  are  a  lot  of  supportive  communities  that  already  exist  in  the  world .PERIOD with  social  networks ,COMMA it  's  an  amazing  way ,COMMA growing  the  number  of  people  that  we  all  have  around  us  in  our  own  supportive  communities ,COMMA rapidly .PERIOD i've  been  wondering ,COMMA how  can  we  engage  these  supportive  communities  to  catalyze  even  more  entrepreneurial  ideas  and  to  catalyze  all  of  us  to  make  tomorrow  better  than  today ?QUESTIONMARK as  i've  researched  what  's  going  on  in  the  united  states ,COMMA a  few  interesting  little  insights  have  come  up .PERIOD so  one  is  that ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA as  we  all  might  expect ,COMMA many  small  businesses  in  the  us .PERIOD and  all  over  the  world  still  need  money  to  grow  and  to  do  more  of  what  they  want  to  do  or  they  might  need  money  during  a  hard  month .PERIOD but  there  's  always  a  need  for  resources  close  by .PERIOD another  thing  is ,COMMA it  turns  out ,COMMA those  resources  do  n't  usually  come  from  the  places  you  might  expect ,COMMA banks ,COMMA venture  capitalists ,COMMA other  organizations  and  support  structures ,COMMA they  come  from  friends  and  family .PERIOD some  statistics  say  85  percent  or  more  of  funding  for  small  businesses  comes  from  friends  and  family .PERIOD that  's  around  130  billion  dollars  a  year  -- .PERIOD it  's  a  lot .PERIOD and  third ,COMMA so  as  people  are  doing  this  friends  and  family  fundraising  process ,COMMA it  's  very  awkward ,COMMA people  do  n't  know  exactly  what  to  ask  for ,COMMA how  to  ask ,COMMA what  to  promise  in  return ,COMMA even  though  they  have  the  best  of  intentions  and  want  to  thank  those  people  that  are  supporting  them .PERIOD so  to  harness  the  power  of  these  supportive  communities  in  a  new  way  and  to  allow  entrepreneurs  to  decide  for  themselves  exactly  what  that  financial  exchange  should  look  like ,COMMA exactly  what  fits  them  and  the  people  around  them ,COMMA this  week  actually ,COMMA we  're  quietly  doing  a  launch  of  profounder ,COMMA which  is  a  crowd  funding  platform  for  small  businesses  to  raise  what  they  need  through  investments  from  their  friends  and  family .PERIOD and  it  's  investments ,COMMA not  donations ,COMMA not  loans ,COMMA but  investments  that  have  a  dynamic  return .PERIOD so  the  mapping  of  participating  in  the  story ,COMMA it  actually  flows  with  the  up  and  down .PERIOD so  in  short ,COMMA it  's  a  do-it-yourself  tool  for  small  businesses  to  raise  these  funds .PERIOD and  what  you  can  do  is  go  onto  the  site ,COMMA create  a  profile ,COMMA create  investment  terms  in  a  really  easy  way .PERIOD we  make  it  really ,COMMA really  simple  for  me  as  well  as  anyone  else  who  wants  to  use  the  site .PERIOD and  we  allow  entrepreneurs  to  share  a  percentage  of  their  revenues .PERIOD they  can  raise  up  to  a  million  dollars  from  an  unlimited  number  of  unaccredited ,COMMA unsophisticated  investors ,COMMA everyday  people ,COMMA heaven  forbid ,COMMA and  they  can  share  those  returns  over  time ,COMMA again ,COMMA whatever  terms  they  set .PERIOD as  investors  choose  to  become  involved  based  on  those  terms ,COMMA they  can  either  take  their  rewards  back  as  cash ,COMMA or  they  can  decide  in  advance  to  give  those  returns  away  to  a  non-profit .PERIOD so  they  can  be  a  cash ,COMMA or  a  cause ,COMMA investor .PERIOD it  's  my  hope  that  this  kind  of  tool  can  show  anybody  who  has  an  idea  a  path  to  go  do  what  they  want  to  do  in  the  world  and  to  gather  the  people  around  them  that  they  already  have ,COMMA the  people  that  know  them  best  and  that  love  them  and  want  to  support  them ,COMMA to  gather  them  to  make  this  happen .PERIOD so  that  's  what  i  'm  working  on  now .PERIOD and  to  close ,COMMA i  just  want  to  say ,COMMA look  these  are  tools .PERIOD right  now ,COMMA profounder  's  right  at  the  very  beginning ,COMMA and  it  's  very  palpable .PERIOD it  's  very  clear  to  me ,COMMA that  it  's  just  a  vessel ,COMMA it  's  just  a  tool .PERIOD what  we  need  are  for  people  to  care ,COMMA to  actually  go  use  it ,COMMA just  like  they've  cared  enough  to  use  kiva  to  make  those  connections .PERIOD but  the  good  news  is  i  do  n't  think  i  need  to  stand  here  and  convince  you  to  care  -- .PERIOD i  'm  not  even  going  to  try .PERIOD i  do  n't  think ,COMMA even  though  we  often  hear ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA hear  the  ethical  and  moral  reasons ,COMMA the  religious  reasons ,COMMA here  's  why  caring  and  giving  will  make  you  happier  i  do  n't  think  we  need  to  be  convinced  of  that .PERIOD i  think  we  know .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA i  think  we  know  so  much ,COMMA and  it  's  such  a  reality  that  we  care  so  deeply ,COMMA that  in  fact ,COMMA what  usually  stops  us  is  that  we  're  afraid  to  try  and  to  mess  up ,COMMA because  we  care  so  very  much  about  helping  each  other  and  being  meaningful  in  each  other  's  lives .PERIOD so  what  i  think  i  can  do  today ,COMMA that  best  thing  i  can  give  you ,COMMA and  i  think  i  can  remind  us  that  we  do  care .PERIOD i  think  we  all  already  know  that .PERIOD and  i  think  we  know  that  love  is  resilient  enough  just  a  sec .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD for  me ,COMMA the  best  way  to  be  inspired  to  try  is  to  stop  and  to  listen  to  someone  else  's  story .PERIOD and  i  'm  grateful  that  i've  gotten  to  do  that  here  at  ted .PERIOD and  i  'm  grateful  that  whenever  i  do  that ,COMMA guaranteed ,COMMA i  am  inspired ,COMMA i  am  inspired  by  the  person  i  am  listening  to .PERIOD and  i  believe  more  and  more  every  time  i  listen  in  that  that  person  's  potential  to  do  great  things  in  the  world  and  in  my  own  potential  to  maybe  help .PERIOD and  that ,COMMA forget  the  tools ,COMMA forget  the  moving  around  of  resources ,COMMA that  stuff  's  easy .PERIOD believing  in  each  other ,COMMA really  being  sure  when  push  comes  to  shove  that  each  one  of  us  can  do  amazing  things  in  the  world ,COMMA that  is  what  can  make  our  stories  into  love  stories  and  our  collective  story  into  one  that  continually  perpetuates  hope  and  good  things  for  all  of  us .PERIOD so  that ,COMMA this  belief  in  each  other ,COMMA knowing  that  without  a  doubt  and  practicing  that  every  day  in  whatever  you  do ,COMMA that  's  what  i  believe  will  change  the  world  and  make  tomorrow  better  than  today .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD it  's  the  second  world  war .PERIOD a  german  prison  camp .PERIOD and  this  man ,COMMA archie  cochrane ,COMMA is  a  prisoner  of  war  and  a  doctor ,COMMA and  he  has  a  problem .PERIOD the  problem  is  that  the  men  under  his  care  are  suffering  from  an  excruciating  and  debilitating  condition  that  archie  does  n't  really  understand .PERIOD the  symptoms  are  this  horrible  swelling  up  of  fluids  under  the  skin .PERIOD but  he  does  n't  know  whether  it  's  an  infection ,COMMA whether  it  's  to  do  with  malnutrition .PERIOD he  does  n't  know  how  to  cure  it .PERIOD and  he  's  operating  in  a  hostile  environment .PERIOD and  people  do  terrible  things  in  wars .PERIOD the  german  camp  guards ,COMMA they've  got  bored .PERIOD they've  taken  to  just  firing  into  the  prison  camp  at  random  for  fun .PERIOD on  one  particular  occasion ,COMMA one  of  the  guards  threw  a  grenade  into  the  prisoners  lavatory  while  it  was  full  of  prisoners .PERIOD he  said  he  heard  suspicious  laughter .PERIOD and  archie  cochrane ,COMMA as  the  camp  doctor ,COMMA was  one  of  the  first  men  in  to  clear  up  the  mess .PERIOD and  one  more  thing ,COMMA archie  was  suffering  from  this  illness  himself .PERIOD so  the  situation  seemed  pretty  desperate .PERIOD but  archie  cochrane  was  a  resourceful  person .PERIOD he'd  already  smuggled  vitamin  c  into  the  camp ,COMMA and  now  he  managed  to  get  hold  of  supplies  of  marmite  on  the  black  market .PERIOD now  some  of  you  will  be  wondering  what  marmite  is .PERIOD marmite  is  a  breakfast  spread  beloved  of  the  british .PERIOD it  looks  like  crude  oil .PERIOD it  tastes .PERIOD zesty .PERIOD and  importantly ,COMMA it  's  a  rich  source  of  vitamin  b12 .PERIOD so  archie  splits  the  men  under  his  care  as  best  he  can  into  two  equal  groups .PERIOD he  gives  half  of  them  vitamin  c .PERIOD he  gives  half  of  them  vitamin  b12 .PERIOD he  very  carefully  and  meticulously  notes  his  results  in  an  exercise  book .PERIOD and  after  just  a  few  days ,COMMA it  becomes  clear  that  whatever  is  causing  this  illness ,COMMA marmite  is  the  cure .PERIOD so  cochrane  then  goes  to  the  germans  who  are  running  the  prison  camp .PERIOD now  you've  got  to  imagine  at  the  moment ,COMMA forget  this  photo ,COMMA imagine  this  guy  with  this  long  ginger  beard  and  this  shock  of  red  hair .PERIOD he  has  n't  been  able  to  shave ,COMMA a  sort  of  billy  connolly  figure .PERIOD cochrane ,COMMA he  starts  ranting  at  these  germans  in  this  scottish  accent ,COMMA in  fluent  german ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA but  in  a  scottish  accent ,COMMA and  explains  to  them  how  german  culture  was  the  culture  that  gave  schiller  and  goethe  to  the  world .PERIOD and  he  cannot  understand  how  this  barbarism  can  be  tolerated .PERIOD and  he  vents  his  frustrations .PERIOD and  then  he  goes  back  to  his  quarters ,COMMA breaks  down  and  weeps  because  he  's  convinced  that  the  situation  is  hopeless .PERIOD but  a  young  german  doctor  picks  up  archie  cochrane  's  exercise  book  and  says  to  his  colleagues ,COMMA this  evidence  is  incontrovertible .PERIOD if  we  do  n't  supply  vitamins  to  the  prisoners ,COMMA it  's  a  war  crime  and  the  next  morning ,COMMA supplies  of  vitamin  b12  are  delivered  to  the  camp ,COMMA and  the  prisoners  begin  to  recover .PERIOD now  i  'm  not  telling  you  this  story  because  i  think  archie  cochrane  is  a  dude ,COMMA although  archie  cochrane  is  a  dude .PERIOD i  'm  not  even  telling  you  the  story  because  i  think  we  should  be  running  more  carefully  controlled  randomized  trials  in  all  aspects  of  public  policy ,COMMA although  i  think  that  would  also  be  completely  awesome .PERIOD i  'm  telling  you  this  story  because  archie  cochrane ,COMMA all  his  life ,COMMA fought  against  a  terrible  affliction .PERIOD and  he  realized  it  was  debilitating  to  individuals  and  it  was  corrosive  to  societies .PERIOD and  he  had  a  name  for  it .PERIOD he  called  it  the  god  complex .PERIOD now  i  can  describe  the  symptoms  of  the  god  complex  very ,COMMA very  easily .PERIOD so  the  symptoms  of  the  complex  are ,COMMA no  matter  how  complicated  the  problem

.PERIOD archie  lets  it  die  down .PERIOD and  then  he  says ,COMMA well  that  's  very  interesting ,COMMA gentlemen ,COMMA because  when  i  gave  you  the  table  of  results ,COMMA i  swapped  the  two  columns  around .PERIOD it  turns  out  your  hospitals  are  killing  people ,COMMA and  they  should  be  at  home .PERIOD would  you  like  to  close  down  the  trial  now ,COMMA or  should  we  wait  until  we  have  robust  results  tumbleweed  rolls  through  the  meeting  room .PERIOD but  cochrane  would  do  that  kind  of  thing .PERIOD and  the  reason  he  would  do  that

.PERIOD i  do  not  want  to  have  my  opinions  challenged .PERIOD i  do  not  want  to  have  my  conclusions  tested  it  feels  so  much  more  comfortable  simply  to  lay  down  the  law .PERIOD cochrane  understood  that  uncertainty ,COMMA that  fallibility ,COMMA that  being  challenged ,COMMA they  hurt .PERIOD and  you  sometimes  need  to  be  shocked  out  of  that .PERIOD now  i  'm  not  going  to  pretend  that  this  is  easy .PERIOD it  is  n't  easy .PERIOD it  's  incredibly  painful .PERIOD and  since  i  started  talking  about  this  subject  and  researching  this  subject ,COMMA i've  been  really  haunted  by  something  a  japanese  mathematician  said  on  the  subject .PERIOD so  shortly  after  the  war ,COMMA this  young  man ,COMMA yutaka  taniyama ,COMMA developed  this  amazing  conjecture  called  the  taniyama-shimura  conjecture .PERIOD it  turned  out  to  be  absolutely  instrumental  many  decades  later  in  proving  fermat  's  last  theorem .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA it  turns  out  it  's  equivalent  to  proving  fermat  's  last  theorem .PERIOD you  prove  one ,COMMA you  prove  the  other .PERIOD but  it  was  always  a  conjecture .PERIOD taniyama  tried  and  tried  and  tried  and  he  could  never  prove  that  it  was  true .PERIOD and  shortly  before  his  30th  birthday  in  1958 ,COMMA yutaka  taniyama  killed  himself .PERIOD his  friend ,COMMA goro  shimura ,COMMA who  worked  on  the  mathematics  with  him ,COMMA many  decades  later ,COMMA reflected  on  taniyama  's  life .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA he  was  not  a  very  careful  person  as  a  mathematician .PERIOD he  made  a  lot  of  mistakes .PERIOD but  he  made  mistakes  in  a  good  direction .PERIOD i  tried  to  emulate  him ,COMMA but  i  realized  it  is  very  difficult  to  make  good  mistakes  thank  you .PERIOD so ,COMMA i'd  like  to  spend  a  few  minutes  with  you  folks  today  imagining  what  our  planet  might  look  like  in  a  thousand  years .PERIOD but  before  i  do  that ,COMMA i  need  to  talk  to  you  about  synthetic  materials  like  plastics ,COMMA which  require  huge  amounts  of  energy  to  create  and ,COMMA because  of  their  disposal  issues ,COMMA are  slowly  poisoning  our  planet .PERIOD i  also  want  to  tell  you  and  share  with  you  how  my  team  and  i  have  been  using  mushrooms  over  the  last  three  years .PERIOD not  like  that .PERIOD we  're  using  mushrooms  to  create  an  entirely  new  class  of  materials ,COMMA which  perform  a  lot  like  plastics  during  their  use ,COMMA but  are  made  from  crop  waste  and  are  totally  compostable  at  the  end  of  their  lives .PERIOD but  first ,COMMA i  need  to  talk  to  you  about  what  i  consider  one  of  the  most  egregious  offenders  in  the  disposable  plastics  category .PERIOD this  is  a  material  you  all  know  is  styrofoam ,COMMA but  i  like  to  think  of  it  as  toxic  white  stuff .PERIOD in  a  single  cubic  foot  of  this  material ,COMMA about  what  would  come  around  your  computer  or  large  television ,COMMA you  have  the  same  energy  content  of  about  a  liter  and  a  half  of  petrol .PERIOD yet ,COMMA after  just  a  few  weeks  of  use ,COMMA you  'll  throw  this  material  in  the  trash .PERIOD and  this  is  n't  just  found  in  packaging .PERIOD 20  billion  dollars  of  this  material  is  produced  every  year ,COMMA in  everything  from  building  materials  to  surfboards  to  coffee  cups  to  table  tops .PERIOD and  that  's  not  the  only  place  it  's  found .PERIOD the  epa  estimates ,COMMA in  the  united  states ,COMMA by  volume ,COMMA this  material  occupies  25  percent  of  our  landfills .PERIOD even  worse  is  when  it  finds  its  way  into  our  natural  environment ,COMMA on  the  side  of  the  road  or  next  to  a  river .PERIOD if  it  's  not  picked  up  by  a  human ,COMMA like  me  and  you ,COMMA it  'll  stay  there  for  thousands  and  thousands  of  years .PERIOD perhaps  even  worse  is  when  it  finds  its  way  into  our  oceans ,COMMA like  in  the  great  plastic  gyre ,COMMA where  these  materials  are  being  mechanically  broken  into  smaller  and  smaller  bits ,COMMA but  they  're  not  really  going  away .PERIOD they  're  not  biologically  compatible .PERIOD they  're  basically  fouling  up  earth  's  respiratory  and  circulatory  systems .PERIOD and  because  these  materials  are  so  prolific ,COMMA because  they  're  found  in  so  many  places ,COMMA there  's  one  other  place  you  'll  find  this  material ,COMMA styrene ,COMMA which  is  made  from  benzene ,COMMA a  known  carcinogen .PERIOD you  'll  find  it  inside  of  you .PERIOD so ,COMMA for  all  these  reasons ,COMMA i  think  we  need  better  materials ,COMMA and  there  are  three  key  principles  we  can  use  to  guide  these  materials .PERIOD the  first  is  feedstocks .PERIOD today ,COMMA we  use  a  single  feedstock ,COMMA petroleum ,COMMA to  heat  our  homes ,COMMA power  our  cars  and  make  most  of  the  materials  you  see  around  you .PERIOD we  recognize  this  is  a  finite  resource ,COMMA and  it  's  simply  crazy  to  do  this ,COMMA to  put  a  liter  and  a  half  of  petrol  in  the  trash  every  time  you  get  a  package .PERIOD second  of  all ,COMMA we  should  really  strive  to  use  far  less  energy  in  creating  these  materials .PERIOD i  say  far  less ,COMMA because  10  percent  is  n't  going  to  cut  it .PERIOD we  should  be  talking  about  half ,COMMA a  quarter ,COMMA one-tenth  the  energy  content .PERIOD and  lastly ,COMMA and  i  think  perhaps  most  importantly ,COMMA we  should  be  creating  materials  that  fit  into  what  i  call  nature  's  recycling  system .PERIOD this  recycling  system  has  been  in  place  for  the  last  billion  years .PERIOD i  fit  into  it ,COMMA you  fit  into  it ,COMMA and  a  hundred  years  tops ,COMMA my  body  can  return  to  the  earth  with  no  preprocessing .PERIOD yet  that  packaging  i  got  in  the  mail  yesterday  is  going  to  last  for  thousands  of  years .PERIOD this  is  crazy .PERIOD but  nature  provides  us  with  a  really  good  model  here .PERIOD when  a  tree  's  done  using  its  leaves ,COMMA its  solar  collectors ,COMMA these  amazing  molecular  photon  capturing  devices ,COMMA at  the  end  of  a  season ,COMMA it  does  n't  pack  them  up ,COMMA take  them  to  the  leaf  reprocessing  center  and  have  them  melted  down  to  form  new  leaves .PERIOD it  just  drops  them ,COMMA the  shortest  distance  possible ,COMMA to  the  forest  floor ,COMMA where  they  're  actually  upcycled  into  next  year  's  topsoil .PERIOD and  this  gets  us  back  to  the  mushrooms .PERIOD because  in  nature ,COMMA mushrooms  are  the  recycling  system .PERIOD and  what  we've  discovered  is ,COMMA by  using  a  part  of  the  mushroom  you've  probably  never  seen ,COMMA analogous  to  its  root  structure .PERIOD it  's  called  mycelium ,COMMA we  can  actually  grow  materials  with  many  of  the  same  properties  of  conventional  synthetics .PERIOD now ,COMMA mycelium  is  an  amazing  material ,COMMA because  it  's  a  self-assembling  material .PERIOD it  actually  takes  things  we  would  consider  waste ,COMMA things  like  seed  husks  or  woody  biomass ,COMMA and  can  transform  them  into  a  chitinous  polymer ,COMMA which  you  can  form  into  almost  any  shape .PERIOD in  our  process ,COMMA we  basically  use  it  as  a  glue .PERIOD and  by  using  mycelium  as  a  glue ,COMMA you  can  mold  things  just  like  you  do  in  the  plastic  industry ,COMMA and  you  can  create  materials  with  many  different  properties ,COMMA materials  that  are  insulating ,COMMA fire-resistant ,COMMA moisture-resistant ,COMMA vapor-resistant ,COMMA materials  that  can  absorb  impacts ,COMMA that  can  absorb  acoustical  impacts .PERIOD but  these  materials  are  grown  from  agricultural  byproducts ,COMMA not  petroleum .PERIOD and  because  they  're  made  of  natural  materials ,COMMA they  are  100  percent  compostable  in  you  own  backyard .PERIOD so  i'd  like  to  share  with  you  the  four  basic  steps  required  to  make  these  materials .PERIOD the  first  is  selecting  a  feedstock ,COMMA preferably  something  that  's  regional ,COMMA that  's  in  your  area ,COMMA right ,COMMA local  manufacturing .PERIOD the  next  is  actually  taking  this  feedstock  and  putting  in  a  tool ,COMMA physically  filling  an  enclosure ,COMMA a  mold ,COMMA in  whatever  shape  you  want  to  get .PERIOD then  you  actually  grow  the  mycelium  through  these  particles ,COMMA and  that  's  where  the  magic  happens ,COMMA because  the  organism  is  doing  the  work  in  this  process ,COMMA not  the  equipment .PERIOD the  final  step  is ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA the  product ,COMMA whether  it  's  a  packaging  material ,COMMA a  table  top ,COMMA or  building  block .PERIOD our  vision  is  local  manufacturing ,COMMA like  the  local  food  movement ,COMMA for  production .PERIOD so  we've  created  formulations  for  all  around  the  world  using  regional  byproducts .PERIOD if  you  're  in  china ,COMMA you  might  use  a  rice  husk  or  a  cottonseed  hull .PERIOD if  you  're  in  northern  europe  or  north  america ,COMMA you  can  use  things  like  buckwheat  husks  or  oat  hulls .PERIOD we  then  process  these  husks  with  some  basic  equipment .PERIOD and  i  want  to  share  with  you  a  quick  video  from  our  facility  that  gives  you  a  sense  of  how  this  looks  at  scale .PERIOD so  what  you  're  seeing  here  is  actually  cotton  hulls  from  texas ,COMMA in  this  case .PERIOD it  's  a  waste  product .PERIOD and  what  they  're  doing  in  our  equipment  is  going  through  a  continuous  system ,COMMA which  cleans ,COMMA cooks ,COMMA cools  and  pasteurizes  these  materials ,COMMA while  also  continuously  inoculating  them  with  our  mycelium .PERIOD this  gives  us  a  continuous  stream  of  material  that  we  can  put  into  almost  any  shape ,COMMA though  today  we  're  making  corner  blocks .PERIOD and  it  's  when  this  lid  goes  on  the  part ,COMMA that  the  magic  really  starts .PERIOD because  the  manufacturing  process  is  our  organism .PERIOD it  'll  actually  begin  to  digest  these  wastes  and ,COMMA over  the  next  five  days ,COMMA assemble  them  into  biocomposites .PERIOD our  entire  facility  is  comprised  of  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  of  these  tools  sitting  indoors  in  the  dark ,COMMA quietly  self-assembling  materials ,COMMA and  everything  from  building  materials  to ,COMMA in  this  case ,COMMA a  packaging  corner  block .PERIOD so  i've  said  a  number  of  times  that  we  grow  materials .PERIOD and  it  's  kind  of  hard  to  picture  how  that  happens .PERIOD so  my  team  has  taken  five  days-worth  of  growth ,COMMA a  typical  growth  cycle  for  us ,COMMA and  condensed  it  into  a  15-second  time  lapse .PERIOD and  i  want  you  to  really  watch  closely  these  little  white  dots  on  the  screen ,COMMA because ,COMMA over  the  five-day  period ,COMMA what  they  do  is  extend  out  and  through  this  material ,COMMA using  the  energy  that  's  contained  in  these  seed  husks  to  build  this  chitinous  polymer  matrix .PERIOD this  matrix  self-assembles ,COMMA growing  through  and  around  the  particles ,COMMA making  millions  and  millions  of  tiny  fibers .PERIOD and  what  parts  of  the  seed  husk  we  do  n't  digest ,COMMA actually  become  part  of  the  final ,COMMA physical  composite .PERIOD so  in  front  of  your  eyes ,COMMA this  part  just  self-assembled .PERIOD it  actually  takes  a  little  longer .PERIOD it  takes  five  days .PERIOD but  it  's  much  faster  than  conventional  farming .PERIOD the  last  step ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA is  application .PERIOD in  this  case ,COMMA we've  grown  a  corner  block .PERIOD a  major  fortune  500  furniture  maker  uses  these  corner  blocks  to  protect  their  tables  in  shipment .PERIOD they  used  to  use  a  plastic  packaging  buffer ,COMMA but  we  were  able  to  give  them  the  exact  same  physical  performance  with  our  grown  material .PERIOD best  of  all ,COMMA when  it  gets  to  the  customer ,COMMA it  's  not  trash .PERIOD they  can  actually  put  this  in  their  natural  ecosystem  without  any  processing ,COMMA and  it  's  going  to  improve  the  local  soil .PERIOD so ,COMMA why  mycelium ?QUESTIONMARK the  first  reason  is  local  open  feedstocks .PERIOD you  want  to  be  able  to  do  this  anywhere  in  the  world  and  not  worry  about  peak  rice  hull  or  peak  cottonseed  hulls ,COMMA because  you  have  multiple  choices .PERIOD the  next  is  self-assembly ,COMMA because  the  organism  is  actually  doing  most  of  the  work  in  this  process .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  a  lot  of  equipment  to  set  up  a  production  facility .PERIOD so  you  can  have  lots  of  small  facilities  spread  all  across  the  world .PERIOD biological  yield  is  really  important .PERIOD and  because  100  percent  of  what  we  put  in  the  tool  become  the  final  product ,COMMA even  the  parts  that  are  n't  digested  become  part  of  the  structure ,COMMA we  're  getting  incredible  yield  rates .PERIOD natural  polymers ,COMMA well .PERIOD i  think  that  's  what  's  most  important ,COMMA because  these  polymers  have  been  tried  and  tested  in  our  ecosystem  for  the  last  billion  years ,COMMA in  everything  from  mushrooms  to  crustaceans .PERIOD they  're  not  going  to  clog  up  earth  's  ecosystems .PERIOD they  work  great .PERIOD and  while ,COMMA today ,COMMA we  can  practically  guarantee  that  yesterday  's  packaging  is  going  to  be  here  in  10,000  years ,COMMA what  i  want  to  guarantee  is  that  in  10,000  years ,COMMA our  descendants ,COMMA our  children  's  children ,COMMA will  be  living  happily  and  in  harmony  with  a  healthy  earth .PERIOD and  i  think  that  can  be  some  really  good  news .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD so  since  i  was  here  last  in  06 ,COMMA we  discovered  that  global  climate  change  is  turning  out  to  be  a  pretty  serious  issue .PERIOD so  we  covered  that  fairly  extensively  in  skeptic  magazine .PERIOD we  investigate  all  kinds  of  scientific  and  quasi-scientific  controversies .PERIOD but  it  turns  out  we  do  n't  have  to  worry  about  any  of  this  because  the  world  's  going  to  end  in  2012 .PERIOD another  update ,COMMA you  will  recall  i  introduced  you  guys  to  the  quadro  tracker .PERIOD it  's  like  a  water  dowsing  device .PERIOD it  's  just  a  hollow  piece  of  plastic  with  an  antenna  that  swivels  around .PERIOD and  you  walk  around ,COMMA and  it  points  to  things .PERIOD like  if  you  're  looking  for  marijuana  in  students  lockers ,COMMA it  'll  point  right  to  somebody .PERIOD oh ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD this  particular  one  that  was  given  to  me  finds  golf  balls ,COMMA especially  if  you  're  at  a  golf  course  and  you  check  under  enough  bushes .PERIOD well ,COMMA under  the  category  of  what  's  the  harm  of  silly  stuff  like  this ?QUESTIONMARK this  device ,COMMA the  ade  651 ,COMMA was  sold  to  the  iraqi  government  for  40,000  dollars  apiece .PERIOD it  's  just  like  this  one ,COMMA completely  worthless ,COMMA in  which  it  allegedly  worked  by  electrostatic  magnetic  ion  attraction ,COMMA which  translates  to  pseudoscientific  baloney ,COMMA would  be  the  nice  word ,COMMA in  which  you  string  together  a  bunch  of  words  that  sound  good ,COMMA but  it  does  absolutely  nothing .PERIOD in  this  case ,COMMA at  trespass  points ,COMMA allowing  people  to  go  through  because  your  little  tracker  device  said  they  were  okay ,COMMA actually  cost  lives .PERIOD so  there  is  a  danger  to  pseudoscience ,COMMA in  believing  in  this  sort  of  thing .PERIOD so  what  i  want  to  talk  about  today  is  belief .PERIOD i  want  to  believe ,COMMA and  you  do  too .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA i  think  my  thesis  here  is  that  belief  is  the  natural  state  of  things .PERIOD it  is  the  default  option .PERIOD we  just  believe .PERIOD we  believe  all  sorts  of  things .PERIOD belief  is  natural .PERIOD disbelief ,COMMA skepticism ,COMMA science ,COMMA is  not  natural .PERIOD it  's  more  difficult .PERIOD it  's  uncomfortable  to  not  believe  things .PERIOD so  like  fox  mulder  on  x-files ,COMMA who  wants  to  believe  in  ufos ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA we  all  do .PERIOD and  the  reason  for  that  is  because  we  have  a  belief  engine  in  our  brains .PERIOD essentially ,COMMA we  are  pattern-seeking  primates .PERIOD we  connect  the  dots ,COMMA a  is  connected  to  b .PERIOD b  is  connected  to  c .PERIOD and  sometimes  a  really  is  connected  to  b .PERIOD and  that  's  called  association  learning .PERIOD we  find  patterns ,COMMA we  make  those  connections ,COMMA whether  it  's  pavlov  's  dog  here  associating  the  sound  of  the  bell  with  the  food ,COMMA and  then  he  salivates  to  the  sound  of  the  bell ,COMMA or  whether  it  's  a  skinnerian  rat ,COMMA in  which  he  's  having  an  association  between  his  behavior  and  a  reward  for  it ,COMMA and  therefore  he  repeats  the  behavior .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA what  skinner  discovered  is  that ,COMMA if  you  put  a  pigeon  in  a  box  like  this ,COMMA and  he  has  to  press  one  of  these  two  keys ,COMMA and  he  tries  to  figure  out  what  the  pattern  is ,COMMA and  you  give  him  a  little  reward  in  the  hopper  box  there  -- .PERIOD if  you  just  randomly  assign  rewards  such  that  there  is  no  pattern ,COMMA they  will  figure  out  any  kind  of  pattern .PERIOD and  whatever  they  were  doing  just  before  they  got  the  reward ,COMMA they  repeat  that  particular  pattern .PERIOD sometimes  it  was  even  spinning  around  twice  counterclockwise ,COMMA once  clockwise  and  peck  the  key  twice .PERIOD and  that  's  called  superstition .PERIOD and  that ,COMMA i  'm  afraid ,COMMA we  will  always  have  with  us .PERIOD i  call  this  process  patternicity ,COMMA that  is ,COMMA the  tendency  to  find  meaningful  patterns  in  both  meaningful  and  meaningless  noise .PERIOD when  we  do  this  process ,COMMA we  make  two  types  of  errors .PERIOD a  type  i  error ,COMMA or  false  positive ,COMMA is  believing  a  pattern  is  real  when  it  's  not .PERIOD our  second  type  of  error  is  a  false  negative .PERIOD a  type  ii  error  is  not  believing  a  pattern  is  real  when  it  is .PERIOD so  let  's  do  a  thought  experiment .PERIOD you  are  a  hominid  three  million  years  ago  walking  on  the  plains  of  africa .PERIOD your  name  is  lucy ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK and  you  hear  a  rustle  in  the  grass .PERIOD is  it  a  dangerous  predator ,COMMA or  is  it  just  the  wind ?QUESTIONMARK your  next  decision  could  be  the  most  important  one  of  your  life .PERIOD well ,COMMA if  you  think  that  the  rustle  in  the  grass  is  a  dangerous  predator  and  it  turns  out  it  's  just  the  wind ,COMMA you've  made  an  error  in  cognition ,COMMA made  a  type  i  error ,COMMA false  positive .PERIOD but  no  harm .PERIOD you  just  move  away .PERIOD you  're  more  cautious .PERIOD you  're  more  vigilant .PERIOD on  the  other  hand ,COMMA if  you  believe  that  the  rustle  in  the  grass  is  just  the  wind ,COMMA and  it  turns  out  it  's  a  dangerous  predator ,COMMA you  're  lunch .PERIOD you've  just  won  a  darwin  award .PERIOD you've  been  taken  out  of  the  gene  pool .PERIOD now  the  problem  here  is  that  patternicities  will  occur  whenever  the  cost  of  making  a  type  i  error  is  less  than  the  cost  of  making  a  type  ii  error .PERIOD this  is  the  only  equation  in  the  talk  by  the  way .PERIOD we  have  a  pattern  detection  problem  that  is  assessing  the  difference  between  a  type  i  and  a  type  ii  error  is  highly  problematic ,COMMA especially  in  split-second ,COMMA life-and-death  situations .PERIOD so  the  default  position  is  just ,COMMA believe  all  patterns  are  real  -- .PERIOD all  rustles  in  the  grass  are  dangerous  predators  and  not  just  the  wind .PERIOD and  so  i  think  that  we  evolved .PERIOD there  was  a  natural  selection  for  the  propensity  for  our  belief  engines ,COMMA our  pattern-seeking  brain  processes ,COMMA to  always  find  meaningful  patterns  and  infuse  them  with  these  sort  of  predatory  or  intentional  agencies  that  i  'll  come  back  to .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA what  do  you  see  here ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  a  horse  head ,COMMA that  's  right .PERIOD it  looks  like  a  horse .PERIOD it  must  be  a  horse .PERIOD that  's  a  pattern .PERIOD and  is  it  really  a  horse ?QUESTIONMARK or  is  it  more  like  a  frog ?QUESTIONMARK see ,COMMA our  pattern  detection  device ,COMMA which  appears  to  be  located  in  the  anterior  cingulate  cortex ,COMMA it  's  our  little  detection  device  there ,COMMA can  be  easily  fooled ,COMMA and  this  is  the  problem .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA what  do  you  see  here ?QUESTIONMARK yes ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA it  's  a  cow .PERIOD once  i  prime  the  brain ,COMMA it  's  called  cognitive  priming ,COMMA once  i  prime  the  brain  to  see  it ,COMMA it  pops  back  out  again  even  without  the  pattern  that  i've  imposed  on  it .PERIOD and  what  do  you  see  here ?QUESTIONMARK some  people  see  a  dalmatian  dog .PERIOD yes ,COMMA there  it  is .PERIOD and  there  's  the  prime .PERIOD so  when  i  go  back  without  the  prime ,COMMA your  brain  already  has  the  model  so  you  can  see  it  again .PERIOD what  do  you  see  here ?QUESTIONMARK planet  saturn .PERIOD yes ,COMMA that  's  good .PERIOD how  about  here ?QUESTIONMARK just  shout  out  anything  you  see .PERIOD that  's  a  good  audience ,COMMA chris .PERIOD because  there  's  nothing  in  this .PERIOD well ,COMMA allegedly  there  's  nothing .PERIOD this  is  an  experiment  done  by  jennifer  whitson  at  ut .PERIOD austin  on  corporate  environments  and  whether  feelings  of  uncertainty  and  out  of  control  makes  people  see  illusory  patterns .PERIOD that  is ,COMMA almost  everybody  sees  the  planet  saturn .PERIOD people  that  are  put  in  a  condition  of  feeling  out  of  control  are  more  likely  to  see  something  in  this ,COMMA which  is  allegedly  patternless .PERIOD in  other  words ,COMMA the  propensity  to  find  these  patterns  goes  up  when  there  's  a  lack  of  control .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA baseball  players  are  notoriously  superstitious  when  they  're  batting ,COMMA but  not  so  much  when  they  're  fielding .PERIOD because  fielders  are  successful  90  to  95  percent  of  the  time .PERIOD the  best  batters  fail  seven  out  of  10  times .PERIOD so  their  superstitions ,COMMA their  patternicities ,COMMA are  all  associated  with  feelings  of  lack  of  control  and  so  forth .PERIOD what  do  you  see  in  this  particular  one  here ,COMMA in  this  field ?QUESTIONMARK anybody  see  an  object  there ?QUESTIONMARK there  actually  is  something  here ,COMMA but  it  's  degraded .PERIOD while  you  're  thinking  about  that ,COMMA this  was  an  experiment  done  by  susan  blackmore ,COMMA a  psychologist  in  england ,COMMA who  showed  subjects  this  degraded  image  and  then  ran  a  correlation  between  their  scores  on  an  esp  test ,COMMA how  much  did  they  believe  in  the  paranormal ,COMMA supernatural ,COMMA angels  and  so  forth .PERIOD and  those  who  scored  high  on  the  esp  scale ,COMMA tended  to  not  only  see  more  patterns  in  the  degraded  images  but  incorrect  patterns .PERIOD here  is  what  you  show  subjects .PERIOD the  fish  is  degraded  20  percent ,COMMA 50  percent  and  then  the  one  i  showed  you ,COMMA 70  percent .PERIOD a  similar  experiment  was  done  by  another  swiss  psychologist  named  peter  brugger ,COMMA who  found  significantly  more  meaningful  patterns  were  perceived  on  the  right  hemisphere ,COMMA via  the  left  visual  field ,COMMA than  the  left  hemisphere .PERIOD so  if  you  present  subjects  the  images  such  that  it  's  going  to  end  up  on  the  right  hemisphere  instead  of  the  left ,COMMA then  they  're  more  likely  to  see  patterns  than  if  you  put  it  on  the  left  hemisphere .PERIOD our  right  hemisphere  appears  to  be  where  a  lot  of  this  patternicity  occurs .PERIOD so  what  we  're  trying  to  do  is  bore  into  the  brain  to  see  where  all  this  happens .PERIOD brugger  and  his  colleague ,COMMA christine  mohr ,COMMA gave  subjects  l-dopa .PERIOD l-dopa  's  a  drug ,COMMA as  you  know ,COMMA given  for  treating  parkinson  's  disease ,COMMA which  is  related  to  a  decrease  in  dopamine .PERIOD l-dopa  increases  dopamine .PERIOD an  increase  of  dopamine  caused  subjects  to  see  more  patterns  than  those  that  did  not  receive  the  dopamine .PERIOD so  dopamine  appears  to  be  the  drug  associated  with  patternicity .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA neuroleptic  drugs  that  are  used  to  eliminate  psychotic  behavior ,COMMA things  like  paranoia ,COMMA delusions  and  hallucinations ,COMMA these  are  patternicities .PERIOD they  're  incorrect  patterns .PERIOD they  're  false  positives .PERIOD they  're  type  i  errors .PERIOD and  if  you  give  them  drugs  that  are  dopamine  antagonists ,COMMA they  go  away .PERIOD that  is ,COMMA you  decrease  the  amount  of  dopamine ,COMMA and  their  tendency  to  see  patterns  like  that  decreases .PERIOD on  the  other  hand ,COMMA amphetamines  like  cocaine  are  dopamine  agonists .PERIOD they  increase  the  amount  of  dopamine .PERIOD so  you  're  more  likely  to  feel  in  a  euphoric  state ,COMMA creativity ,COMMA find  more  patterns .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA i  saw  robin  williams  recently  talk  about  how  he  thought  he  was  much  funnier  when  he  was  doing  cocaine ,COMMA when  he  had  that  issue ,COMMA than  now .PERIOD so  perhaps  more  dopamine  is  related  to  more  creativity .PERIOD dopamine ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA changes  our  signal-to-noise  ratio .PERIOD that  is ,COMMA how  accurate  we  are  in  finding  patterns .PERIOD if  it  's  too  low ,COMMA you  're  more  likely  to  make  too  many  type  ii  errors .PERIOD you  miss  the  real  patterns .PERIOD you  do  n't  want  to  be  too  skeptical .PERIOD if  you  're  too  skeptical ,COMMA you  'll  miss  the  really  interesting  good  ideas .PERIOD just  right ,COMMA you  're  creative ,COMMA and  yet  you  do  n't  fall  for  too  much  baloney .PERIOD too  high  and  maybe  you  see  patterns  everywhere .PERIOD every  time  somebody  looks  at  you ,COMMA you  think  people  are  staring  at  you .PERIOD you  think  people  are  talking  about  you .PERIOD and  if  you  go  too  far  on  that ,COMMA that  's  just  simply  labeled  as  madness .PERIOD it  's  a  distinction  perhaps  we  might  make  between  two  nobel  laureates ,COMMA richard  feynman  and  john  nash .PERIOD one  sees  maybe  just  the  right  number  of  patterns  to  win  a  nobel  prize .PERIOD the  other  one  also ,COMMA but  maybe  too  many  patterns .PERIOD and  we  then  call  that  schizophrenia .PERIOD so  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  then  presents  us  with  a  pattern-detection  problem .PERIOD and  of  course  you  all  know  exactly  what  this  is ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and  what  pattern  do  you  see  here ?QUESTIONMARK again ,COMMA i  'm  putting  your  anterior  cingulate  cortex  to  the  test  here ,COMMA causing  you  conflicting  pattern  detections .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA this  is  via  uno  shoes .PERIOD these  are  sandals .PERIOD pretty  sexy  feet ,COMMA i  must  say .PERIOD maybe  a  little  photoshopped .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA the  ambiguous  figures  that  seem  to  flip-flop  back  and  forth .PERIOD it  turns  out  what  you  're  thinking  about  a  lot  influences  what  you  tend  to  see .PERIOD and  you  see  the  lamp  here ,COMMA i  know .PERIOD because  the  lights  on  here .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA thanks  to  the  environmentalist  movement  we  're  all  sensitive  to  the  plight  of  marine  mammals .PERIOD so  what  you  see  in  this  particular  ambiguous  figure  is ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA the  dolphins ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK you  see  a  dolphin  here .PERIOD and  there  's  a  dolphin .PERIOD and  there  's  a  dolphin .PERIOD that  's  a  dolphin  tail  there ,COMMA guys .PERIOD if  we  can  give  you  conflicting  data ,COMMA again ,COMMA your  acc  is  going  to  be  going  into  hyperdrive .PERIOD if  you  look  down  here ,COMMA it  's  fine .PERIOD if  you  look  up  here ,COMMA then  you  get  conflicting  data .PERIOD and  then  we  have  to  flip  the  image  for  you  to  see  that  it  's  a  set  up .PERIOD the  impossible  crate  illusion .PERIOD it  's  easy  to  fool  the  brain  in  2d .PERIOD so  you  say ,COMMA aw ,COMMA come  on  shermer ,COMMA anybody  can  do  that  in  a  psych  101  text  with  an  illusion  like  that .PERIOD well  here  's  the  late ,COMMA great  jerry  andrus  impossible  crate  illusion  in  3d ,COMMA in  which  jerry  is  standing  inside  the  impossible  crate .PERIOD and  he  was  kind  enough  to  post  this  and  give  us  the  reveal .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA camera  angle  is  everything .PERIOD the  photographer  is  over  there .PERIOD and  this  board  appears  to  overlap  with  this  one ,COMMA and  this  one  with  that  one ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD but  even  when  i  take  it  away ,COMMA the  illusion  is  so  powerful  because  of  how  are  brains  are  wired  to  find  those  certain  kinds  of  patterns .PERIOD this  is  a  fairly  new  one  that  throws  us  off  because  of  the  conflicting  patterns  of  comparing  this  angle  with  that  angle .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA it  's  the  exact  same  picture  side  by  side .PERIOD so  what  you  're  doing  is  comparing  that  angle  instead  of  with  this  one ,COMMA but  with  that  one .PERIOD and  so  your  brain  is  fooled .PERIOD yet  again ,COMMA your  pattern  detection  devices  are  fooled .PERIOD faces  are  easy  to  see  because  we  have  an  additional  evolved  facial  recognition  software  in  our  temporal  lobes .PERIOD here  's  some  faces  on  the  side  of  a  rock .PERIOD i  'm  actually  not  even  sure  if  this  is ,COMMA this  might  be  photoshopped .PERIOD but  anyway ,COMMA the  point  is  still  made .PERIOD now  which  one  of  these  looks  odd  to  you ?QUESTIONMARK in  a  quick  reaction ,COMMA which  one  looks  odd ?QUESTIONMARK the  one  on  the  left .PERIOD okay .PERIOD so  i  'll  rotate  it  so  it  'll  be  the  one  on  the  right .PERIOD and  you  are  correct .PERIOD a  fairly  famous  illusion ,COMMA it  was  first  done  with  margaret  thatcher .PERIOD now ,COMMA they  trade  up  the  politicians  every  time .PERIOD well ,COMMA why  is  this  happening ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA we  know  exactly  where  it  happens ,COMMA in  the  temporal  lobe ,COMMA right  across ,COMMA sort  of  above  your  ear  there .PERIOD in  a  little  structure  called  the  fusiform  gyrus .PERIOD and  there  's  two  types  of  cells  that  do  this ,COMMA that  record  facial  features  either  globally ,COMMA or  specifically  these  large ,COMMA rapid-firing  cells ,COMMA first  look  at  the  general  face .PERIOD so  you  recognize  obama  immediately .PERIOD and  then  you  notice  something  quite  a  little  bit  odd  about  the  eyes  and  the  mouth .PERIOD especially  when  they  're  upside  down .PERIOD you  're  engaging  that  general  facial  recognition  software  there .PERIOD now  i  said  back  in  our  little  thought  experiment ,COMMA you  're  a  hominid  walking  on  the  plains  of  africa .PERIOD is  it  just  the  wind  or  a  dangerous  predator ?QUESTIONMARK what  's  the  difference  between  those ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  wind  is  inanimate .PERIOD the  dangerous  predator  is  an  intentional  agent .PERIOD and  i  call  this  process  agenticity .PERIOD that  is  the  tendency  to  infuse  patterns  with  meaning ,COMMA intention  and  agency ,COMMA often  invisible  beings  from  the  top  down .PERIOD this  is  an  idea  that  we  got  from  a  fellow  tedster  here ,COMMA dan  dennett ,COMMA who  talked  about  taking  the  intentional  stance .PERIOD so  it  's  a  type  of  that  expanded  to  explain ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA a  lot  of  different  things ,COMMA souls ,COMMA spirits ,COMMA ghosts ,COMMA gods ,COMMA demons ,COMMA angels ,COMMA aliens ,COMMA intelligent  designers ,COMMA government  conspiracists  and  all  manner  of  invisible  agents  with  power  and  intention ,COMMA are  believed  to  haunt  our  world  and  control  our  lives .PERIOD i  think  it  's  the  basis  of  animism  and  polytheism  and  monotheism .PERIOD it  's  the  belief  that  aliens  are  somehow  more  advanced  than  us ,COMMA more  moral  than  us ,COMMA and  the  narratives  always  are  that  they  're  coming  here  to  save  us  and  rescue  us  from  on  high .PERIOD the  intelligent  designer  's  always  portrayed  as  this  super  intelligent ,COMMA moral  being  that  comes  down  to  design  life .PERIOD even  the  idea  that  government  can  rescue  us  -- .PERIOD that  's  no  longer  the  wave  of  the  future .PERIOD but  that  is ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA a  type  of  agenticity ,COMMA projecting  somebody  up  there ,COMMA big  and  powerful ,COMMA will  come  rescue  us .PERIOD and  this  is  also ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA the  basis  of  conspiracy  theories .PERIOD there  's  somebody  hiding  behind  there  pulling  the  strings ,COMMA whether  it  's  the  illuminati  or  the  bilderbergers .PERIOD but  this  is  a  pattern  detection  problem ,COMMA is  n't  it ?QUESTIONMARK some  patterns  are  real  and  some  are  not .PERIOD was  jfk  assassinated  by  a  conspiracy  or  by  a  lone  assassin ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA if  you  go  there ,COMMA there  's  people  there  on  any  given  day ,COMMA like  when  i  went  there ,COMMA here ,COMMA showing  me  where  the  different  shooters  were .PERIOD my  favorite  one  was  he  was  in  the  manhole .PERIOD and  he  popped  out  at  the  last  second ,COMMA took  that  shot .PERIOD but  of  course ,COMMA lincoln  was  assassinated  by  a  conspiracy .PERIOD so  we  cannot  just  uniformly  dismiss  all  patterns  like  that .PERIOD because ,COMMA let  's  face  it ,COMMA some  patterns  are  real .PERIOD some  conspiracies  really  are  true .PERIOD explains  a  lot ,COMMA maybe .PERIOD and  9/11  has  a  conspiracy  theory .PERIOD it  is  a  conspiracy .PERIOD we  did  a  whole  issue  on  it .PERIOD nineteen  members  of  al  queda  plotting  to  fly  planes  into  buildings  constitutes  a  conspiracy .PERIOD but  that  's  not  what  the  9/11  truthers  think .PERIOD they  think  it  was  an  inside  job  by  the  bush  administration .PERIOD well ,COMMA that  's  a  whole  other  lecture .PERIOD you  know  how  we  know  that  9/11  was  not  orchestrated  by  the  bush  administration ?QUESTIONMARK because  it  worked .PERIOD so  we  are  natural-born  dualists .PERIOD our  agenticity  process  comes  from  the  fact  that  we  can  enjoy  movies  like  these .PERIOD because  we  can  imagine ,COMMA in  essence ,COMMA continuing  on .PERIOD we  know  that  if  you  stimulate  the  temporal  lobe ,COMMA you  can  produce  a  feeling  of  out-of-body  experiences ,COMMA near-death  experiences ,COMMA which  you  can  do  by  just  touching  an  electrode  to  the  temporal  lobe  there .PERIOD or  you  can  do  it  through  loss  of  consciousness ,COMMA by  accelerating  in  a  centrifuge .PERIOD you  get  a  hypoxia ,COMMA or  a  lower  oxygen .PERIOD and  the  brain  then  senses  that  there  's  an  out-of-body  experience .PERIOD you  can  use ,COMMA which  i  did ,COMMA went  out  and  did ,COMMA michael  persinger  's  god  helmet ,COMMA that  bombards  your  temporal  lobes  with  electromagnetic  waves .PERIOD and  you  get  a  sense  of  out-of-body  experience .PERIOD so  i  'm  going  to  end  here  with  a  short  video  clip  that

.PERIOD and  then  as  now ,COMMA it  was  a  beautiful  place  of  balls  and  punts ,COMMA beautiful  people ,COMMA many  of  whom  took  to  heart  ronald  reagan  's  comment  that ,COMMA even  if

,COMMA leaving  school  at  a  time  then  of  rapidly  growing  youth  unemployment ,COMMA and  essentially  hitting  a  brick  wall  in  terms  of  their  opportunities .PERIOD and  i  spent  quite  a  lot  of  time  with  them  rather  than  in  punts .PERIOD and  they  were  people  who  were  not  short  of  wit ,COMMA or  grace  or  energy ,COMMA but  they  had  no  hope ,COMMA no  jobs ,COMMA no  prospects .PERIOD and  when  people  are  n't  allowed  to  be  useful ,COMMA they  soon  think  that  they  're  useless .PERIOD and  although  that  was  great  for  the  music  business  at  the  time ,COMMA it  was  n't  much  good  for  anything  else .PERIOD and  ever  since  then ,COMMA i've  wondered  why  it  is  that  capitalism  is  so  amazingly  efficient  at  some  things ,COMMA but  so  inefficient  at  others ,COMMA why  it  's  so  innovative  in  some  ways  and  so  un-innovative  in  others .PERIOD now ,COMMA since  that  time ,COMMA we've  actually  been  through  an  extraordinary  boom ,COMMA the  longest  boom  ever  in  the  history  of  this  country .PERIOD unprecedented  wealth  and  prosperity .PERIOD but  that  growth  has  n't  always  delivered  what  we  needed .PERIOD hl .PERIOD mencken  once  said  that ,COMMA to  every  complex  problem ,COMMA there  is  a  simple  solution  and  it  's  wrong .PERIOD but  i  'm  not  saying  growth  is  wrong ,COMMA but  it  's  very  striking  that  throughout  the  years  of  growth ,COMMA many  things  did  n't  get  better .PERIOD rates  of  depression  carried  on  up ,COMMA right  across  the  western  world .PERIOD if  you  look  at  america ,COMMA the  proportion  of  americans  with  no  one  to  talk  to  about  important  things  went  up  from  a  tenth  to  a  quarter

clearer  that  economic  growth  does  n't  automatically  translate  into  social  growth  or  human  growth .PERIOD we  're  now  at  another  moment  when  another  wave  of  teenagers  are  entering  a  cruel  job  market .PERIOD there  will  be  a  million  unemployed  young  people  here  by  the  end  of  the  year .PERIOD thousands  losing  their  jobs  everyday  in  america .PERIOD we've  got  to  do  whatever  we  can  to  help  them .PERIOD but  we've  also  got  to  ask ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA a  more  profound  question  of  whether  we  use  this  crisis  to  jump  forward  to  a  different  kind  of  economy  that  's  more  suited  to  human  needs ,COMMA to  a  better  balance  of  economy  and  society .PERIOD and  i  think  one  of  the  lessons  of  history  is  that  even  the  deepest  crises  can  be  moments  of  opportunity .PERIOD they  bring  ideas  from  the  margins  into  the  mainstream .PERIOD they  often  lead  to  the  acceleration  of

a  few  months  on ,COMMA however  good  politicians  are  at  swallowing  frogs  without  pulling  a  face ,COMMA as  someone  once  put  it ,COMMA they  cannot  hide  their  uncertainty .PERIOD because  it  's  already  clear  how  much  of  the  enormous  amount  of  money  they  put  into  the  economy ,COMMA really  went  into  fixing  the  past ,COMMA bailing  out  the  banks ,COMMA the  car  companies ,COMMA not  preparing  us  for  the  future .PERIOD how  much  of  the  money  is  going  into  concrete  and  boosting  consumption ,COMMA not  into  solving  the  really  profound  problems  we  have  to  solve .PERIOD and  everywhere ,COMMA as  people  think  about  the  unprecedented  sums  which  are  being  spent  of  our  money  and  our  children  's  money ,COMMA now ,COMMA in  the  depth  of  this  crisis ,COMMA they  're  asking ,COMMA surely ,COMMA we  should  be  using  this  with  a  longer-term  vision  to  accelerate  the  shift  to  a  green  economy ,COMMA to  prepare  for  aging ,COMMA to  deal  with  some  of  the  inequalities  which  scar  countries  like  this  and  the  united  states  rather  than  just  giving  the  money  to  the

is  like  cooking  a  small  fish .PERIOD do  n't  overdo  it .PERIOD and  i  think  more  and  more  people  are  also  asking ,COMMA why  boost  consumption ,COMMA rather  than  change  what  we  consume ?QUESTIONMARK like  the  mayor  of  são  paulo  who  's  banned  advertising  billboards ,COMMA or  the  many  cities  like  san  francisco  putting  in  infrastructures  for  electric  cars .PERIOD you  can  see  a  bit  of  the  same  thing  happening  in  the  business  world .PERIOD some ,COMMA i  think  some  of  the  bankers  who  have  appear  to  have  learned  nothing  and  forgotten  nothing .PERIOD but  ask  yourselves ,COMMA what  will  be  the  biggest  sectors  of  the  economy  in  10 ,COMMA 20 ,COMMA 30  years  time ?QUESTIONMARK it  wo  n't  be  the  ones  lining  up  for  handouts ,COMMA like  cars  and  aerospace  and  so  on .PERIOD the  biggest  sector ,COMMA by  far ,COMMA will  be  health ,COMMA already  18  percent  of  the  american  economy ,COMMA predicted  to  grow  to  30 ,COMMA even  40  percent  by  mid-century .PERIOD elder  care ,COMMA child  care ,COMMA already  much  bigger  employers  than  cars .PERIOD education ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA eight  percent  of  the  economy  and  growing .PERIOD environmental  services ,COMMA energy  services ,COMMA the  myriad  of  green  jobs ,COMMA they  're  all  pointing  to  a  very  different  kind  of  economy  which  is  n't  just  about  products ,COMMA but  is  using  distributed  networks ,COMMA and  it  's  founded  above  all  on  care ,COMMA on  relationships .PERIOD on  what  people  do  to  other  people ,COMMA often  one  to  one ,COMMA rather  than  simply  selling  them  a  product .PERIOD and  i  think  that  what  connects  the  challenge  for  civil  society ,COMMA the  challenge  for  governments  and  the  challenge  for  business  now  is ,COMMA in  a  way ,COMMA a  very  simple  one ,COMMA but  quite  a  difficult  one .PERIOD we  know  our  societies  have  to  radically  change .PERIOD we  know  we  cannot  go  back  to  where  we  were  before  the  crisis .PERIOD but  we  also  know  it  's  only  through  experiment  that  we  'll  discover  exactly  how  to  run  a  low  carbon  city ,COMMA how  to  care  for  a  much  older  population ,COMMA how  to  deal  with  drug  addiction  and  so  on .PERIOD and  here  's  the  problem .PERIOD in  science ,COMMA we  do  experiments  systematically .PERIOD our  societies  now  spend  two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four  percent  of  gdp  to  invest  systematically  in  new  discovery ,COMMA in  science ,COMMA in  technology ,COMMA to  fuel  the  pipeline  of  brilliant  inventions  which  illuminate  gatherings  like  this .PERIOD it  's  not  that  our  scientists  are  necessarily  much  smarter  than  they  were  a  hundred  years  ago ,COMMA maybe  they  are ,COMMA but  they  have  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  backing  than  they  ever  did .PERIOD and  what  's  striking  though ,COMMA is  that  in  society  there  's  almost  nothing  comparable ,COMMA no  comparable  investment ,COMMA no  systematic  experiment ,COMMA in  the  things  capitalism  is  n't  very  good  at ,COMMA like  compassion ,COMMA or  empathy ,COMMA or  relationships  or  care .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  did  n't  really  understand  that  until  i  met  this  guy  who  was  then  an  80-year-old ,COMMA slightly  shambolic  man  who  lived  on  tomato  soup  and  thought  ironing  was  very  overrated .PERIOD he  had  helped  shape  britain  's  post-war  institutions ,COMMA its  welfare  state ,COMMA its  economy ,COMMA but  had  sort  of  reinvented  himself  as  a  social  entrepreneur ,COMMA became  an  inventor  of  many ,COMMA many  different  organizations .PERIOD some  famous  ones  like  the  open  university ,COMMA which  has  110,000  students ,COMMA the  university  of  the  third  age ,COMMA which  has  nearly  half  a  million  older  people  teaching  other  older  people ,COMMA as  well  as  strange  things  like  diy  garages  and  language  lines  and  schools  for  social  entrepreneurs .PERIOD and  he  ended  his  life  selling  companies  to  venture  capitalists .PERIOD he  believed  if  you  see  a  problem ,COMMA you  should  n't  tell  someone  to  act ,COMMA you  should  act  on  it  yourself ,COMMA and  he  lived  long  enough  and  saw  enough  of  his  ideas  first  scorned  and  then  succeed  that  he  said  you  should  always  take  no  as  a  question  and  not  as  an  answer .PERIOD and  his  life  was  a  systematic  experiment  to  find  better  social  answers ,COMMA not  from  a  theory ,COMMA but  from  experiment ,COMMA and  experiment  involving  the  people  with  the  best  intelligence  on  social  needs ,COMMA which  were  usually  the  people  living  with  those  needs .PERIOD and  he  believed  we  live  with  others ,COMMA we  share  the  world  with  others  and  therefore  our  innovation  must  be  done  with  others  too ,COMMA not  doing  things  at  people ,COMMA for  them ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD now ,COMMA what  he  did  did  n't  used  to  have  a  name ,COMMA but  i  think  it  's  rapidly  becoming  quite  mainstream .PERIOD it  's  what  we  do  in  the  organization  named  after  him  where  we  try  and  invent ,COMMA create ,COMMA launch  new  ventures ,COMMA whether  it  's  schools ,COMMA web  companies ,COMMA health  organizations  and  so  on .PERIOD and  we  find  ourselves  part  of  a  very  rapidly  growing  global  movement  of  institutions  working  on  social  innovation ,COMMA using  ideas  from  design  or  technology  or  community  organizing  to  develop  the  germs  of  a  future  world ,COMMA but  through  practice  and  through  demonstration  and  not  through  theory .PERIOD and  they  're  spreading  from  korea  to  brazil  to  india  to  the  usa  and  across  europe .PERIOD and  they've  been  given  new  momentum  by  the  crisis ,COMMA by  the  need  for  better  answers  to  joblessness ,COMMA community  breakdown  and  so  on .PERIOD some  of  the  ideas  are  strange .PERIOD these  are  complaints  choirs .PERIOD people  come  together  to  sing  about  the  things  that  really  bug  them .PERIOD others  are  much  more  pragmatic ,COMMA health  coaches ,COMMA learning  mentors ,COMMA job  clubs .PERIOD and  some  are  quite  structural ,COMMA like  social  impact  bonds  where  you  raise  money  to  invest  in  diverting  teenagers  from  crime  or  helping  old  people  keep  out  of  hospital ,COMMA and  you  get  paid  back  according  to  how  successful  your  projects  are .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  idea  that  all  of  this  represents ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA is  rapidly  becoming  a  common  sense  and  part  of  how  we  respond  to  the  crisis ,COMMA recognizing  the  need  to  invest  in  innovation  for  social  progress  as  well  as  technological  progress .PERIOD there  were  big  health  innovation  funds  launched  earlier  this  year  in  this  country ,COMMA as  well  as  a  public  service  innovation  lab .PERIOD across  northern  europe ,COMMA many  governments  now  have  innovation  laboratories  within  them .PERIOD and  just  a  few  months  ago ,COMMA president  obama  launched  the  office  of  social  innovation  in  the  white  house .PERIOD and  what  people  are  beginning  to  ask  is ,COMMA surely ,COMMA just  as  we  invest  in  r  and  d ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four  percent ,COMMA of  our  gdp ,COMMA of  our  economy ,COMMA what  if  we  put ,COMMA let  's  say ,COMMA one  percent  of  public  spending  into  social  innovation ,COMMA into  elder  care ,COMMA new  kinds  of  education ,COMMA new  ways  of  helping  the  disabled ?QUESTIONMARK perhaps  we'd  achieve  similar  productivity  gains  in  society  to  those  we've  had  in  the  economy  and  in  technology .PERIOD and  if ,COMMA a  generation  or  two  ago ,COMMA the  big  challenges  were  ones  like  getting  a  man  on  the  moon ,COMMA perhaps  the  challenges  we  need  to  set  ourselves  now  are  ones  like  eliminating  child  malnutrition ,COMMA stopping  trafficking ,COMMA or  one ,COMMA i  think  closer  to  home  for  america  or  europe ,COMMA why  do  n't  we  set  ourselves  the  goal  of  achieving  a  billion  extra  years  of  life  for  today  's  citizens .PERIOD now  those  are  all  goals  which  could  be  achieved  within  a  decade ,COMMA but  only  with  radical  and  systematic  experiment ,COMMA not  just  with  technologies ,COMMA but  also  with  lifestyles  and  culture  and  policies  and  institutions  too .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  want  to  end  by  saying  a  little  bit  about  what  i  think  this  means  for  capitalism .PERIOD i  think  what  this  is  all  about ,COMMA this  whole  movement  which  is  growing  from  the  margins ,COMMA remains  quite  small .PERIOD nothing  like  the  resources  of  a  cern  or  a  darpa  or  an  ibm  or  a  dupont .PERIOD what  it  's  telling  us  is  that  capitalism  is  going  to  become  more  social .PERIOD it  's  already  immersed  in  social  networks .PERIOD it  will  become  more  involved  in  social  investment ,COMMA and  social  care  and  in  industries  where  the  value  comes  from  what  you  do  with  others ,COMMA not  just  from  what  you  sell  to  them ,COMMA and  from  relationships  as  well  as  from  consumption .PERIOD but  interestingly  too ,COMMA it  implies  a  future  where  society  learns  a  few  tricks  from  capitalism  about  how  you  embed  the  dna  of  restless  continual  innovation  into  society ,COMMA trying  things  out  and  then  growing  and  scaling  the  ones  that  work .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  think  this  future  will  be  quite  surprising  to  many  people .PERIOD in  recent  years ,COMMA a  lot  of  intelligent  people  thought  that  capitalism  had  basically  won .PERIOD history  was  over  and  society  would  inevitably  have  to  take  second  place  to  economy .PERIOD but  i've  been  struck  with  a  parallel  in  how  people  often  talk  about  capitalism  today  and  how  they  talked  about  the  monarchy  200  years  ago ,COMMA just  after  the  french  revolution  and  the  restoration  of  the  monarchy  in  france .PERIOD then ,COMMA people  said  monarchy  dominated  everywhere  because  it  was  rooted  in  human  nature .PERIOD we  were  naturally  deferential .PERIOD we  needed  hierarchy .PERIOD just  as  today ,COMMA the  enthusiasts  of  unrestrained  capitalism  say  it  's  rooted  in  human  nature ,COMMA only  now  it  's  individualism ,COMMA inquisitiveness ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD then  monarchy  had  seen  off  its  big  challenger ,COMMA mass  democracy ,COMMA which  was  seen  as  a  well-intentioned  but  doomed  experiment .PERIOD just  as  capitalism  has  seen  off  socialism .PERIOD even  fidel  castro  now  says  that  the  only  thing  worse  than  being  exploited  by  multinational  capitalism  is  not  being  exploited  by  multinational  capitalism .PERIOD and  whereas  then  monarchies ,COMMA palaces  and  forts  dominated  every  city  skyline  and  looked  permanent  and  confident ,COMMA today  it  's  the  gleaming  towers  of  the  banks  which  dominate  every  big  city .PERIOD i  'm  not  suggesting  the  crowds  are  about  to  storm  the  barricades  and  string  up  every  investment  banker  from  the  nearest  lamppost ,COMMA though  that  might  be  quite  tempting .PERIOD but  i  do  think  we  're  on  the  verge  of  a  period  when ,COMMA just  as  happened  to  the  monarchy  and ,COMMA interestingly ,COMMA the  military  too ,COMMA the  central  position  of  finance  capital  is  going  to  come  to  an  end ,COMMA and  it  's  going  to  steadily  move  to  the  sides ,COMMA the  margins  of  our  society ,COMMA transformed  from  being  a  master  into  a  servant ,COMMA a  servant  to  the  productive  economy  and  of  human  needs .PERIOD and  as  that  happens ,COMMA we  will  remember  something  very  simple  and  obvious  about  capitalism ,COMMA which  is  that ,COMMA unlike  what  you  read  in  economics  textbooks ,COMMA it  's  not  a  self-sufficient  system .PERIOD it  depends  on  other  systems ,COMMA on  ecology ,COMMA on  family ,COMMA on  community ,COMMA and  if  these  are  n't  replenished ,COMMA capitalism  suffers  too .PERIOD and  our  human  nature  is  n't  just  selfish ,COMMA it  's  also  compassionate .PERIOD it  's  not  just  competitive ,COMMA it  's  also  caring .PERIOD because  of  the  depth  of  the  crisis ,COMMA i  think  we  are  at  a  moment  of  choice .PERIOD the  crisis  is  almost  certainly  deepening  around  us .PERIOD it  will  be  worse  at  the  end  of  this  year ,COMMA quite  possibly  worse  in  a  year  's  time  than  it  is  today .PERIOD but  this  is  one  of  those  very  rare  moments  when  we  have  to  choose  whether  we  're  just  pedaling  furiously  to  get  back  to  where  we  were  a  year  or  two  ago ,COMMA and  a  very  narrow  idea  of  what  the  economy  is  for ,COMMA or  whether  this  is  a  moment  to  jump  ahead ,COMMA to  reboot  and  to  do  some  of  the  things  we  probably  should  have  been  doing  anyway .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD this  is  the  large  hadron  collider .PERIOD it  's  27  kilometers  in  circumference .PERIOD it  's  the  biggest  scientific  experiment  ever  attempted .PERIOD

less  than  a  billionth  of  a  second  after  the  universe  began  up  to  600  million  times  a  second  inside  that  detector ,COMMA immense  numbers .PERIOD and  if  you  see  those  metal

that  those  mini-big  bangs  will  be  created ,COMMA sometime  in  the  summer  this  year .PERIOD and  actually ,COMMA this  morning ,COMMA i  got  an  email  saying  that  we've  just  finished ,COMMA today ,COMMA building  the  last  piece  of  atlas .PERIOD so  as  of  today ,COMMA it  's  finished .PERIOD i'd  like  to  say  that  i  planned  that  for  ted ,COMMA but  i  did  n't .PERIOD so  it  's  been  completed  as  of  today .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA it  's  a  wonderful  achievement .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  might  be  asking ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK why  create  the  conditions  that  were  present  less  than  a  billionth  of  a  second  after  the  universe  began ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA particle  physicists  are  nothing  if  not  ambitious .PERIOD and  the  aim  of  particle  physics  is  to  understand  what  everything  's  made  of ,COMMA and  how  everything  sticks  together .PERIOD and  by  everything  i  mean ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA me  and  you ,COMMA the  earth ,COMMA the  sun ,COMMA the  100  billion  suns  in  our  galaxy  and  the  100  billion  galaxies  in  the  observable  universe .PERIOD absolutely  everything .PERIOD now  you  might  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA ok ,COMMA but  why  not  just  look  at  it ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ?QUESTIONMARK if  you  want  to  know  what  i  'm  made  of ,COMMA let  's  look  at  me .PERIOD well ,COMMA we  found  that  as  you  look  back  in  time ,COMMA the  universe  gets  hotter  and  hotter ,COMMA denser  and  denser ,COMMA and  simpler  and  simpler .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  's  no  real  reason  i  'm  aware  of  for  that ,COMMA but  that  seems  to  be  the  case .PERIOD so ,COMMA way  back  in  the  early  times  of  the  universe ,COMMA we  believe  it  was  very  simple  and  understandable .PERIOD all  this  complexity ,COMMA all  the  way  to  these  wonderful  things ,COMMA human  brains ,COMMA are  a  property  of  an  old  and  cold  and  complicated  universe .PERIOD back  at  the  start ,COMMA in  the  first  billionth  of  a  second ,COMMA we  believe ,COMMA or  we've  observed ,COMMA it  was  very  simple .PERIOD it  's  almost  like .PERIOD imagine  a  snowflake  in  your  hand ,COMMA and  you  look  at  it ,COMMA and  it  's  an  incredibly  complicated ,COMMA beautiful  object .PERIOD but  as  you  heat  it  up ,COMMA it  'll  melt  into  a  pool  of  water ,COMMA and  you  would  be  able  to  see  that ,COMMA actually ,COMMA it  was  just  made  of  h20 ,COMMA water .PERIOD so  it  's  in  that  same  sense  that  we  look  back  in  time  to  understand  what  the  universe  is  made  of .PERIOD and ,COMMA as  of  today ,COMMA it  's  made  of  these  things .PERIOD just  12  particles  of  matter ,COMMA stuck  together  by  four  forces  of  nature .PERIOD the  quarks ,COMMA these  pink  things ,COMMA are  the  things  that  make  up  protons  and  neutrons  that  make  up  the  atomic  nuclei  in  your  body .PERIOD the  electron ,COMMA the  thing  that  goes  around  the  atomic  nucleus ,COMMA held  around  in  orbit ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA by  the  electromagnetic  force  that  's  carried  by  this  thing ,COMMA the  photon .PERIOD the  quarks  are  stuck  together  by  other  things  called  gluons .PERIOD and  these  guys ,COMMA here ,COMMA they  're  the  weak  nuclear  force ,COMMA probably  the  least  familiar .PERIOD but ,COMMA without  it ,COMMA the  sun  would  n't  shine .PERIOD and  when  the  sun  shines ,COMMA you  get  copious  quantities  of  these  things ,COMMA called  neutrinos ,COMMA pouring  out .PERIOD actually ,COMMA if  you  just  look  at  your  thumbnail ,COMMA about  a  square  centimeter ,COMMA there  are  something  like  60  billion  neutrinos  per  second  from  the  sun ,COMMA passing  through  every  square  centimeter  of  your  body .PERIOD but  you  do  n't  feel  them ,COMMA because  the  weak  force  is  correctly  named  -- .PERIOD very  short  range  and  very  weak ,COMMA so  they  just  fly  through  you .PERIOD and  these  particles  have  been  discovered  over  the  last  century ,COMMA pretty  much .PERIOD the  first  one ,COMMA the  electron ,COMMA was  discovered  in  1897 ,COMMA and  the  last  one ,COMMA this  thing  called  the  tau  neutrino ,COMMA in  the  year  2000 .PERIOD actually  just ,COMMA i  was  going  to  say ,COMMA just  up  the  road  in  chicago .PERIOD i  know  it  's  a  big  country ,COMMA america ,COMMA is  n't  it ?QUESTIONMARK just  up  the  road .PERIOD relative  to  the  universe ,COMMA it  's  just  up  the  road .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  thing  was  discovered  in  the  year  2000 ,COMMA so  it  's  a  relatively  recent  picture .PERIOD one  of  the  wonderful  things ,COMMA actually ,COMMA i  find ,COMMA is  that  we've  discovered  any  of  them ,COMMA when  you  realize  how  tiny  they  are .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA they  're  a  step  in  size  from  the  entire  observable  universe .PERIOD so ,COMMA 100  billion  galaxies ,COMMA 137  billion  light  years  away ,COMMA a  step  in  size  from  that  to  monterey ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is  about  the  same  as  from  monterey  to  these  things .PERIOD absolutely ,COMMA exquisitely  minute ,COMMA and  yet  we've  discovered  pretty  much  the  full  set .PERIOD so ,COMMA one  of  my  most  illustrious  forebears  at  manchester  university ,COMMA ernest  rutherford ,COMMA discoverer  of  the  atomic  nucleus ,COMMA once  said ,COMMA all  science  is  either  physics  or  stamp  collecting .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  do  n't  think  he  meant  to  insult  the  rest  of  science ,COMMA although  he  was  from  new  zealand ,COMMA so  it  's  possible .PERIOD but  what  he  meant  was  that  what  we've  done ,COMMA really ,COMMA is  stamp  collect  there .PERIOD ok ,COMMA we've  discovered  the  particles ,COMMA but  unless  you  understand  the  underlying  reason  for  that  pattern ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA why  it  's  built  the  way  it  is ,COMMA really  you've  done  stamp  collecting .PERIOD you  have  n't  done  science .PERIOD fortunately ,COMMA we  have  probably  one  of  the  greatest  scientific  achievements  of  the  twentieth  century  that  underpins  that  pattern .PERIOD it  's  the  newton  's  laws ,COMMA if  you  want ,COMMA of  particle  physics .PERIOD it  's  called  the  standard  model ,COMMA beautifully  simple  mathematical  equation .PERIOD you  could  stick  it  on  the  front  of  a  t-shirt ,COMMA which  is  always  the  sign  of  elegance .PERIOD this  is  it .PERIOD i've  been  a  little  disingenuous ,COMMA because  i've  expanded  it  out  in  all  its  gory  detail .PERIOD this  equation ,COMMA though ,COMMA allows  you  to  calculate  everything ,COMMA other  than  gravity ,COMMA that  happens  in  the  universe .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  want  to  know  why  the  sky  is  blue ,COMMA why  atomic  nuclei  stick  together ,COMMA in  principle ,COMMA you've  got  a  big  enough  computer ,COMMA why  dna  is  the  shape  it  is .PERIOD in  principle ,COMMA you  should  be  able  to  calculate  it  from  that  equation .PERIOD but  there  's  a  problem .PERIOD can  anyone  see  what  it  is ?QUESTIONMARK a  bottle  of  champagne  for  anyone  that  tells  me .PERIOD i  'll  make  it  easier ,COMMA actually ,COMMA by  blowing  one  of  the  lines  up .PERIOD basically ,COMMA each  of  these  terms  refers  to  some  of  the  particles .PERIOD so  those  ws  there  refer  to  the  ws ,COMMA and  how  they  stick  together .PERIOD these  carriers  of  the  weak  force ,COMMA the  zs ,COMMA the  same .PERIOD but  there  's  an  extra  symbol  in  this  equation ,COMMA h .PERIOD right ,COMMA h .PERIOD h  stands  for  higgs  particle .PERIOD higgs  particles  have  not  been  discovered .PERIOD but  they  're  necessary ,COMMA they  're  necessary  to  make  that  mathematics  work .PERIOD so  all  the  exquisitely  detailed  calculations  we  can  do  with  that  wonderful  equation  would  n't  be  possible  without  an  extra  bit .PERIOD so  it  's  a  prediction ,COMMA a  prediction  of  a  new  particle .PERIOD what  does  it  do ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA we  had  a  long  time  to  come  up  with  good  analogies .PERIOD and  back  in  the  1980s ,COMMA when  we  wanted  the  money  for  the  lhc  from  the  uk .PERIOD government ,COMMA margaret  thatcher ,COMMA at  the  time ,COMMA said ,COMMA if  you  guys  can  explain ,COMMA in  language  a  politician  can  understand ,COMMA what  the  hell  it  is  that  you  're  doing ,COMMA you  can  have  the  money .PERIOD i  want  to  know  what  this  higgs  particle  does .PERIOD and  we  came  up  with  this  analogy ,COMMA and  it  seemed  to  work .PERIOD well ,COMMA what  the  higgs  does  is ,COMMA it  gives  mass  to  the  fundamental  particles .PERIOD and  the  picture  is  that  the  whole  universe ,COMMA and  that  does  n't  mean  just  space ,COMMA it  means  me  as  well ,COMMA and  inside  you ,COMMA the  whole  universe  is  full  of  something  called  a  higgs  field .PERIOD higgs  particles ,COMMA if  you  will .PERIOD the  analogy  is  that  these  people  in  a  room  are  the  higgs  particles .PERIOD now  when  a  particle  moves  through  the  universe ,COMMA it  can  interact  with  these  higgs  particles .PERIOD but  imagine  someone  who  's  not  very  popular  moves  through  the  room .PERIOD then  everyone  ignores  them .PERIOD they  can  just  pass  through  the  room  very  quickly ,COMMA essentially  at  the  speed  of  light .PERIOD they  're  massless .PERIOD and  imagine  someone  incredibly  important  and  popular  and  intelligent  walks  into  the  room .PERIOD they  're  surrounded  by  people ,COMMA and  their  passage  through  the  room  is  impeded .PERIOD it  's  almost  like  they  get  heavy .PERIOD they  get  massive .PERIOD and  that  's  exactly  the  way  the  higgs  mechanism  works .PERIOD the  picture  is  that  the  electrons  and  the  quarks  in  your  body  and  in  the  universe  that  we  see  around  us  are  heavy ,COMMA in  a  sense ,COMMA and  massive ,COMMA because  they  're  surrounded  by  higgs  particles .PERIOD they  're  interacting  with  the  higgs  field .PERIOD if  that  picture  's  true ,COMMA then  we  have  to  discover  those  higgs  particles  at  the  lhc .PERIOD if  it  's  not  true ,COMMA because  it  's  quite  a  convoluted  mechanism ,COMMA although  it  's  the  simplest  we've  been  able  to  think  of ,COMMA then  whatever  does  the  job  of  the  higgs  particles  we  know  have  to  turn  up  at  the  lhc .PERIOD so ,COMMA that  's  one  of  the  prime  reasons  we  built  this  giant  machine .PERIOD i  'm  glad  you  recognize  margaret  thatcher .PERIOD actually ,COMMA i  thought  about  making  it  more  culturally  relevant ,COMMA but ,COMMA anyway .PERIOD so  that  's  one  thing .PERIOD that  's  essentially  a  guarantee  of  what  the  lhc  will  find .PERIOD there  are  many  other  things .PERIOD you've  heard  many  of  the  big  problems  in  particle  physics .PERIOD one  of  them  you  heard  about ,COMMA dark  matter ,COMMA dark  energy .PERIOD there  's  another  issue ,COMMA which  is  that  the  forces  in  nature ,COMMA it  's  quite  beautiful ,COMMA actually ,COMMA seem ,COMMA as  you  go  back  in  time ,COMMA they  seem  to  change  in  strength .PERIOD well ,COMMA they  do  change  in  strength .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  electromagnetic  force ,COMMA the  force  that  holds  us  together ,COMMA gets  stronger  as  you  go  to  higher  temperatures .PERIOD the  strong  force ,COMMA the  strong  nuclear  force ,COMMA which  sticks  nuclei  together ,COMMA gets  weaker .PERIOD and  what  you  see  is  the  standard  model ,COMMA you  can  calculate  how  these  change ,COMMA is  the  forces ,COMMA the  three  forces ,COMMA other  than  gravity ,COMMA almost  seem  to  come  together  at  one  point .PERIOD it  's  almost  as  if  there  was  one  beautiful  kind  of  super-force ,COMMA back  at  the  beginning  of  time .PERIOD but  they  just  miss .PERIOD now  there  's  a  theory  called  super-symmetry ,COMMA which  doubles  the  number  of  particles  in  the  standard  model .PERIOD which ,COMMA at  first  sight ,COMMA does  n't  sound  like  a  simplification .PERIOD but  actually ,COMMA with  this  theory ,COMMA we  find  that  the  forces  of  nature  do  seem  to  unify  together ,COMMA back  at  the  big  bang  -- .PERIOD absolutely  beautiful  prophecy .PERIOD the  model  was  n't  built  to  do  that ,COMMA but  it  seems  to  do  it .PERIOD also ,COMMA those  super-symmetric  particles  are  very  strong  candidates  for  the  dark  matter .PERIOD so  a  very  compelling  theory  that  's  really  mainstream  physics .PERIOD and  if  i  was  to  put  money  on  it ,COMMA i  would  put  money  on ,COMMA in  a  very  unscientific  way ,COMMA that  that  these  things  would  also  crop  up  at  the  lhc .PERIOD many  other  things  that  the  lhc  could  discover .PERIOD but  in  the  last  few  minutes ,COMMA i  just  want  to  give  you  a  different  perspective  of  what  i  think ,COMMA what  particle  physics  really  means  to  me ,COMMA particle  physics  and  cosmology .PERIOD and  that  's  that  i  think  it  's  given  us  a  wonderful  narrative ,COMMA almost  a  creation  story ,COMMA if  you'd  like ,COMMA about  the  universe ,COMMA from  modern  science  over  the  last  few  decades .PERIOD and  i'd  say  that  it  deserves ,COMMA in  the  spirit  of  wade  davis  talk ,COMMA to  be  at  least  put  up  there  with  these  wonderful  creation  stories  of  the  peoples  of  the  high  andes  and  the  frozen  north .PERIOD this  is  a  creation  story ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA equally  as  wonderful .PERIOD the  story  goes  like  this ,COMMA we  know  that  the  universe  began  137  billion  years  ago ,COMMA in  an  immensely  hot ,COMMA dense  state ,COMMA much  smaller  than  a  single  atom .PERIOD it  began  to  expand  about  a  million ,COMMA billion ,COMMA billion ,COMMA billion  billionth  of  a  second ,COMMA i  think  i  got  that  right ,COMMA after  the  big  bang .PERIOD gravity  separated  away  from  the  other  forces .PERIOD the  universe  then  underwent  an  exponential  expansion  called  inflation .PERIOD in  about  the  first  billionth  of  a  second  or  so ,COMMA the  higgs  field  kicked  in ,COMMA and  the  quarks  and  the  gluons  and  the  electrons  that  make  us  up  got  mass .PERIOD the  universe  continued  to  expand  and  cool .PERIOD after  about  a  few  minutes ,COMMA there  was  hydrogen  and  helium  in  the  universe .PERIOD that  's  all .PERIOD the  universe  was  about  75  percent  hydrogen ,COMMA 25  percent  helium .PERIOD it  still  is  today .PERIOD it  continued  to  expand  about  300  million  years .PERIOD then  light  began  to  travel  through  the  universe .PERIOD it  was  big  enough  to  be  transparent  to  light ,COMMA and  that  's  what  we  see  in  the  cosmic  microwave  background  that  george  smoot  described  as  looking  at  the  face  of  god .PERIOD after  about  400  million  years ,COMMA the  first  stars  formed ,COMMA and  that  hydrogen ,COMMA that  helium ,COMMA then  began  to  cook  into  the  heavier  elements .PERIOD so  the  elements  of  life ,COMMA carbon ,COMMA and  oxygen  and  iron ,COMMA all  the  elements  that  we  need  to  make  us  up ,COMMA were  cooked  in  those  first  generations  of  stars ,COMMA which  then  ran  out  of  fuel ,COMMA exploded ,COMMA threw  those  elements  back  into  the  universe .PERIOD they  then  re-collapsed  into  another  generation  of  stars  and  planets .PERIOD and  on  some  of  those  planets ,COMMA the  oxygen ,COMMA which  had  been  created  in  that  first  generation  of  stars ,COMMA could  fuse  with  hydrogen  to  form  water ,COMMA liquid  water  on  the  surface .PERIOD on  at  least  one ,COMMA and  maybe  only  one  of  those  planets ,COMMA primitive  life  evolved ,COMMA which  evolved  over  millions  of  years  into  things  that  walked  upright  and  left  footprints  about  three  and  a  half  million  years  ago  in  the  mud  flats  of  tanzania ,COMMA and  eventually  left  a  footprint  on  another  world .PERIOD and  built  this  civilization ,COMMA this  wonderful  picture ,COMMA that  turned  the  darkness  into  light ,COMMA and  you  can  see  the  civilization  from  space .PERIOD as  one  of  my  great  heroes ,COMMA carl  sagan ,COMMA said ,COMMA these  are  the  things ,COMMA and  actually ,COMMA not  only  these ,COMMA but  i  was  looking  around ,COMMA these  are  the  things ,COMMA like  saturn  v  rockets ,COMMA and  sputnik ,COMMA and  dna ,COMMA and  literature  and  science ,COMMA these  are  the  things  that  hydrogen  atoms  do  when  given  137  billion  years .PERIOD absolutely  remarkable .PERIOD and ,COMMA the  laws  of  physics .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA the  right  laws  of  physics ,COMMA they  're  beautifully  balanced .PERIOD if  the  weak  force  had  been  a  little  bit  different ,COMMA then  carbon  and  oxygen  would  n't  be  stable  inside  the  hearts  of  stars ,COMMA and  there  would  be  none  of  that  in  the  universe .PERIOD and  i  think  that  's  a  wonderful  and  significant  story .PERIOD 50  years  ago ,COMMA i  could  n't  have  told  that  story ,COMMA because  we  did  n't  know  it .PERIOD it  makes  me  really  feel  that  that  civilization ,COMMA which ,COMMA as  i  say ,COMMA if  you  believe  the  scientific  creation  story ,COMMA has  emerged  purely  as  a  result  of  the  laws  of  physics ,COMMA and  a  few  hydrogen  atoms ,COMMA then  i  think ,COMMA to  me  anyway ,COMMA it  makes  me  feel  incredibly  valuable .PERIOD so  that  's  the  lhc .PERIOD the  lhc  is  certainly ,COMMA when  it  turns  on  in  summer ,COMMA going  to  write  the  next  chapter  of  that  book .PERIOD and  i  'm  certainly  looking  forward  with  immense  excitement  to  it  being  turned  on .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD i  'm  here  today  representing  a  team  of  artists  and  technologists  and  filmmakers  that  worked  together  on  a  remarkable  film  project  for  the  last  four  years .PERIOD and  along  the  way  they  created  a  breakthrough  in  computer  visualization .PERIOD so  i  want  to  show  you  a  clip  of  the  film  now .PERIOD hopefully  it  wo  n't  stutter .PERIOD and  if  we  did  our  jobs  well ,COMMA you  wo  n't  know  that  we  were  even  involved .PERIOD voice   ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  how  it  's  possible .PERIOD but  you  seem  to  have  more  hair .PERIOD brad  pitt ,COMMA what  if  i  told  you  that  i  was  n't  getting  older .PERIOD but  i  was  getting  younger  than  everybody  else ?QUESTIONMARK i  was  born  with  some  form  of  disease .PERIOD voice ,COMMA what  kind  of  disease ?QUESTIONMARK bp ,COMMA i  was  born  old .PERIOD man ,COMMA i  'm  sorry .PERIOD bp ,COMMA no  need  to  be .PERIOD there  's  nothing  wrong  with  old  age .PERIOD girl ,COMMA are  you  sick ?QUESTIONMARK bp ,COMMA i  heard  momma  and  tizzy  whisper ,COMMA and  they  said  i  was  gonna  die  soon .PERIOD but .PERIOD maybe  not .PERIOD girl ,COMMA you  're  different  than  anybody  i've  ever  met .PERIOD bb ,COMMA there  were  many  changes .PERIOD some  you  could  see ,COMMA some  you  could  n't .PERIOD hair  started  growing  in  all  sorts  of  places ,COMMA along  with  other  things .PERIOD i  felt  pretty  good ,COMMA considering .PERIOD ed  ulbrich ,COMMA that  was  a  clip  from  the  curious  case  of  benjamin  button .PERIOD many  of  you ,COMMA maybe  you've  seen  it  or  you've  heard  of  the  story ,COMMA but  what  you  might  not  know  is  that  for  nearly  the  first  hour  of  the  film ,COMMA the  main  character ,COMMA benjamin  button ,COMMA who  's  played  by  brad  pitt ,COMMA is  completely  computer-generated  from  the  neck  up .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  's  no  use  of  prosthetic  makeup  or  photography  of  brad  superimposed  over  another  actor  's  body .PERIOD we've  created  a  completely  digital  human  head .PERIOD so  i'd  like  to  start  with  a  little  bit  of  history  on  the  project .PERIOD this  is  based  on  an  f .PERIOD scott  fitzgerald  short  story .PERIOD it  's  about  a  man  who  's  born  old  and  lives  his  life  in  reverse .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  movie  has  floated  around  hollywood  for  well  over  half  a  century ,COMMA and  we  first  got  involved  with  the  project  in  the  early  90s ,COMMA with  ron  howard  as  the  director .PERIOD we  took  a  lot  of  meetings  and  we  seriously  considered  it .PERIOD but  at  the  time  we  had  to  throw  in  the  towel .PERIOD it  was  deemed  impossible .PERIOD it  was  beyond  the  technology  of  the  day  to  depict  a  man  aging  backwards .PERIOD the  human  form ,COMMA in  particular  the  human  head ,COMMA has  been  considered  the  holy  grail  of  our  industry .PERIOD the  project  came  back  to  us  about  a  decade  later ,COMMA and  this  time  with  a  director  named  david  fincher .PERIOD now ,COMMA fincher  is  an  interesting  guy .PERIOD david  is  fearless  of  technology ,COMMA and  he  is  absolutely  tenacious .PERIOD and  david  wo  n't  take  no .PERIOD and  david  believed ,COMMA like  we  do  in  the  visual  effects  industry ,COMMA that  anything  is  possible  as  long  as  you  have  enough  time ,COMMA resources  and ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA money .PERIOD and  so  david  had  an  interesting  take  on  the  film ,COMMA and  he  threw  a  challenge  at  us .PERIOD he  wanted  the  main  character  of  the  film  to  be  played  from  the  cradle  to  the  grave  by  one  actor .PERIOD it  happened  to  be  this  guy .PERIOD we  went  through  a  process  of  elimination  and  a  process  of  discovery  with  david ,COMMA and  we  ruled  out ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA swapping  actors .PERIOD that  was  one  idea ,COMMA that  we  would  have  different  actors ,COMMA and  we  would  hand  off  from  actor  to  actor .PERIOD we  even  ruled  out  the  idea  of  using  makeup .PERIOD we  realized  that  prosthetic  makeup  just  would  n't  hold  up ,COMMA particularly  in  close-up .PERIOD and  makeup  is  an  additive  process .PERIOD you  have  to  build  the  face  up .PERIOD and  david  wanted  to  carve  deeply  into  brad  's  face  to  bring  the  aging  to  this  character .PERIOD he  needed  to  be  a  very  sympathetic  character .PERIOD so  we  decided  to  cast  a  series  of  little  people  that  would  play  the  different  bodies  of  benjamin  at  the  different  increments  of  his  life  and  that  we  would  in  fact  create  a  computer-generated  version  of  brad  's  head ,COMMA aged  to  appear  as  benjamin ,COMMA and  attach  that  to  the  body  of  the  real  actor .PERIOD sounded  great .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA this  was  the  holy  grail  of  our  industry ,COMMA and  the  fact  that  this  guy  is  a  global  icon  did  n't  help  either ,COMMA because  i  'm  sure  if  any  of  you  ever  stand  in  line  at  the  grocery  store ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA we  see  his  face  constantly .PERIOD so  there  really  was  no  tolerable  margin  of  error .PERIOD there  were  two  studios  involved ,COMMA warner  brothers  and  paramount .PERIOD and  they  both  believed  this  would  make  an  amazing  film ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA but  it  was  a  very  high-risk  proposition .PERIOD there  was  lots  of  money  and  reputations  at  stake .PERIOD but  we  believed  that  we  had  a  very  solid  methodology  that  might  work .PERIOD but  despite  our  verbal  assurances ,COMMA they  wanted  some  proof .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA in  2004 ,COMMA they  commissioned  us  to  do  a  screen  test  of  benjamin .PERIOD and  we  did  it  in  about  five  weeks .PERIOD but  we  used  lots  of  cheats  and  shortcuts .PERIOD we  basically  put  something  together  to  get  through  the  meeting .PERIOD i  'll  roll  that  for  you  now .PERIOD this  was  the  first  test  for  benjamin  button .PERIOD and  in  here ,COMMA you  can  see ,COMMA that  's  a  computer-generated  head ,COMMA pretty  good ,COMMA attached  to  the  body  of  an  actor .PERIOD and  it  worked .PERIOD and  it  gave  the  studio  great  relief .PERIOD after  many  years  of  starts  and  stops  on  this  project ,COMMA and  making  that  tough  decision ,COMMA they  finally  decided  to  greenlight  the  movie .PERIOD and  i  can  remember ,COMMA actually ,COMMA when  i  got  the  phone  call  to  congratulate  us ,COMMA to  say  the  movie  was  a  go ,COMMA i  actually  threw  up .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA this  is  some  tough  stuff .PERIOD so  we  started  to  have  early  team  meetings ,COMMA and  we  got  everybody  together ,COMMA and  it  was  really  more  like  therapy  in  the  beginning ,COMMA convincing  each  other  and  reassuring  each  other  that  we  could  actually  undertake  this .PERIOD we  had  to  hold  up  an  hour  of  a  movie  with  a  character .PERIOD and  it  's  not  a  special  effects  film .PERIOD it  has  to  be  a  man .PERIOD we  really  felt  like  we  were  in  a ,COMMA kind  of  a  12-step  program .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA the  first  step  is ,COMMA admit  you've  got  a  problem .PERIOD so  we  had  a  big  problem: .PERIOD we  did  n't  know  how  we  were  going  to  do  this .PERIOD but  we  did  know  one  thing .PERIOD being  from  the  visual  effects  industry ,COMMA we ,COMMA with  david ,COMMA believed  that  we  now  had  enough  time ,COMMA enough  resources ,COMMA and ,COMMA god ,COMMA we  hoped  we  had  enough  money .PERIOD and  we  had  enough  passion  to  will  the  processes  and  technology  into  existence .PERIOD so ,COMMA when  you  're  faced  with  something  like  that ,COMMA of  course  you've  got  to  break  it  down .PERIOD you  take  the  big  problem  and  you  break  it  down  into  smaller  pieces  and  you  start  to  attack  that .PERIOD so  we  had  three  main  areas  that  we  had  to  focus  on .PERIOD we  needed  to  make  brad  look  a  lot  older  -- .PERIOD needed  to  age  him  45  years  or  so .PERIOD and  we  also  needed  to  make  sure  that  we  could  take  brad  's  idiosyncrasies ,COMMA his  little  tics ,COMMA the  little  subtleties  that  make  him  who  he  is  and  have  that  translate  through  our  process  so  that  it  appears  in  benjamin  on  the  screen .PERIOD and  we  also  needed  to  create  a  character  that  could  hold  up  under ,COMMA really ,COMMA all  conditions .PERIOD he  needed  to  be  able  to  walk  in  broad  daylight ,COMMA at  nighttime ,COMMA under  candlelight ,COMMA he  had  to  hold  an  extreme  close-up ,COMMA he  had  to  deliver  dialogue .PERIOD he  had  to  be  able  to  take  a  bath ,COMMA to  cry ,COMMA he  even  had  to  throw  up .PERIOD not  all  at  the  same  time ,COMMA but  he  had  to ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA do  all  of  those  things .PERIOD and  the  work  had  to  hold  up  for  almost  the  first  hour  of  the  movie .PERIOD we  did  about  325  shots .PERIOD so  we  needed  a  system  that  would  allow  benjamin  to  do  everything  a  human  being  can  do .PERIOD and  we  realized  that  there  was  a  giant  chasm  between  the  state  of  the  art  of  technology  in  2004  and  where  we  needed  it  to  be .PERIOD so  we  focused  on  motion  capture .PERIOD i  'm  sure  many  of  you  have  seen  motion  capture .PERIOD the  state  of  the  art  at  the  time  was  something  called  marker-based  motion  capture .PERIOD i  'll  give  you  an  example  here .PERIOD it  's  basically  the  idea  of ,COMMA you  wear  a  leotard ,COMMA and  they  put  some  reflective  markers  on  your  body ,COMMA and  instead  of  using  cameras ,COMMA there  're  infrared  sensors  around  a  volume ,COMMA and  those  infrared  sensors  track  the  three-dimensional  position  of  those  markers  in  real  time .PERIOD and  then  animators  can  take  the  data  of  the  motion  of  those  markers  and  apply  them  to  a  computer-generated  character .PERIOD you  can  see  the  computer  characters  on  the  right  are  having  the  same  complex  motion  as  the  dancers .PERIOD but  we  also  looked  at  numbers  of  other  films  at  the  time  that  were  using  facial  marker  tracking ,COMMA and  that  's  the  idea  of  putting  markers  on  the  human  face  and  doing  the  same  process .PERIOD and  as  you  can  see ,COMMA it  gives  you  a  pretty  crappy  performance .PERIOD that  's  not  terribly  compelling .PERIOD and  what  we  realized  was  that  what  we  needed  was  the  information  that  was  going  on  between  the  markers .PERIOD we  needed  the  subtleties  of  the  skin .PERIOD we  needed  to  see  skin  moving  over  muscle  moving  over  bone .PERIOD we  needed  creases  and  dimples  and  wrinkles  and  all  of  those  things .PERIOD our  first  revelation  was  to  completely  abort  and  walk  away  from  the  technology  of  the  day ,COMMA the  status  quo ,COMMA the  state  of  the  art .PERIOD so  we  aborted  using  motion  capture .PERIOD and  we  were  now  well  out  of  our  comfort  zone ,COMMA and  in  uncharted  territory .PERIOD so  we  were  left  with  this  idea  that  we  ended  up  calling  technology  stew .PERIOD we  started  to  look  out  in  other  fields .PERIOD the  idea  was  that  we  were  going  to  find  nuggets  or  gems  of  technology  that  come  from  other  industries  like  medical  imaging ,COMMA the  video  game  space ,COMMA and  re-appropriate  them .PERIOD and  we  had  to  create  kind  of  a  sauce .PERIOD and  the  sauce  was  code  in  software  that  we'd  written  to  allow  these  disparate  pieces  of  technology  to  come  together  and  work  as  one .PERIOD initially ,COMMA we  came  across  some  remarkable  research  done  by  a  gentleman  named  dr.  paul  ekman  in  the  early  70s .PERIOD he  believed  that  he  could ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA catalog  the  human  face .PERIOD and  he  came  up  with  this  idea  of  facial  action  coding  system ,COMMA or  facs .PERIOD he  believed  that  there  were  70  basic  poses  or  shapes  of  the  human  face ,COMMA and  that  those  basic  poses  or  shapes  of  the  face  can  be  combined  to  create  infinite  possibilities  of  everything  the  human  face  is  capable  of  doing .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA these  transcend  age ,COMMA race ,COMMA culture ,COMMA gender .PERIOD so  this  became  the  foundation  of  our  research  as  we  went  forward .PERIOD and  then  we  came  across  some  remarkable  technology  called  contour .PERIOD and  here  you  can  see  a  subject  having  phosphorus  makeup  stippled  on  her  face .PERIOD and  now  what  we  're  looking  at  is  really  creating  a  surface  capture  as  opposed  to  a  marker  capture .PERIOD the  subject  stands  in  front  of  a  computer  array  of  cameras ,COMMA and  those  cameras  can ,COMMA frame-by-frame ,COMMA reconstruct  the  geometry  of  exactly  what  the  subject  's  doing  at  the  moment .PERIOD so ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA you  get  3d  data  in  real  time  of  the  subject .PERIOD and  if  you  look  in  a  comparison ,COMMA on  the  left ,COMMA we  see  what  volumetric  data  gives  us  and  on  the  right  you  see  what  markers  give  us .PERIOD so ,COMMA clearly ,COMMA we  were  in  a  substantially  better  place  for  this .PERIOD but  these  were  the  early  days  of  this  technology ,COMMA and  it  was  n't  really  proven  yet .PERIOD we  measure  complexity  and  fidelity  of  data  in  terms  of  polygonal  count .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA on  the  left ,COMMA we  were  seeing  100,000  polygons .PERIOD we  could  go  up  into  the  millions  of  polygons .PERIOD it  seemed  to  be  infinite .PERIOD this  was  when  we  had  our  aha .PERIOD this  was  the  breakthrough .PERIOD this  is  when  we  're  like ,COMMA ok ,COMMA we  're  going  to  be  ok ,COMMA this  is  actually  going  to  work .PERIOD and  the  aha  was ,COMMA what  if  we  could  take  brad  pitt ,COMMA and  we  could  put  brad  in  this  device ,COMMA and  use  this  contour  process .PERIOD and  we  could  stipple  on  this  phosphorescent  makeup  and  put  him  under  the  black  lights .PERIOD and  we  could ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA scan  him  in  real  time  performing  ekman  's  facs  poses .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA we  ended  up  with  a  3d  database  of  everything  brad  pitt  's  face  is  capable  of  doing .PERIOD from  there ,COMMA we  actually  carved  up  those  faces  into  smaller  pieces  and  components  of  his  face .PERIOD so  we  ended  up  with  literally  thousands  and  thousands  and  thousands  of  shapes .PERIOD a  complete  database  of  all  possibilities  that  his  face  is  capable  of  doing .PERIOD now ,COMMA that  's  great ,COMMA except  we  had  him  at  age  44 .PERIOD we  need  to  put  another  40  years  on  him  at  this  point .PERIOD we  brought  in  rick  baker ,COMMA and  rick  is  one  of  the  great  makeup  and  special  effects  gurus  of  our  industry .PERIOD and  we  also  brought  in  a  gentleman  named  kazu  tsuji ,COMMA and  kazu  tsuji  is  one  of  the  great  photorealist  sculptors  of  our  time .PERIOD and  we  commissioned  them  to  make  a  maquette ,COMMA or  a  bust ,COMMA of  benjamin .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  the  spirit  of  the  great  unveiling ,COMMA i  had  to  do  this ,COMMA i  had  to  unveil  something .PERIOD so  this  is  ben  80 .PERIOD we  created  three  of  these ,COMMA there  's  ben  80 ,COMMA there  's  ben  70 ,COMMA there  's  ben  60 .PERIOD and  this  really  became  the  template  for  moving  forward .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  was  made  from  a  life  cast  of  brad .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA anatomically ,COMMA it  is  correct .PERIOD the  eyes ,COMMA the  jaw ,COMMA the  teeth: .PERIOD everything  is  in  perfect  alignment  with  what  the  real  guy  has .PERIOD we  have  these  maquettes  scanned  into  the  computer  at  very  high  resolution  -- .PERIOD enormous  polygonal  count .PERIOD and  so  now  we  had  three  age  increments  of  benjamin  in  the  computer .PERIOD but  we  needed  to  get  a  database  of  him  doing  more  than  that .PERIOD we  went  through  this  process ,COMMA then ,COMMA called  retargeting .PERIOD this  is  brad  doing  one  of  the  ekman  facs  poses .PERIOD and  here  's  the  resulting  data  that  comes  from  that ,COMMA the  model  that  comes  from  that .PERIOD retargeting  is  the  process  of  transposing  that  data  onto  another  model .PERIOD and  because  the  life  cast ,COMMA or  the  bust ,COMMA the  maquette ,COMMA of  benjamin  was  made  from  brad ,COMMA we  could  transpose  the  data  of  brad  at  44  onto  brad  at  87 .PERIOD so  now ,COMMA we  had  a  3d  database  of  everything  brad  pitt  's  face  can  do  at  age  87 ,COMMA in  his  70s  and  in  his  60s .PERIOD next  we  had  to  go  into  the  shooting  process .PERIOD so  while  all  that  's  going  on ,COMMA we  're  down  in  new  orleans  and  locations  around  the  world .PERIOD and  we  shot  our  body  actors ,COMMA and  we  shot  them  wearing  blue  hoods .PERIOD so  these  are  the  gentleman  who  played  benjamin .PERIOD and  the  blue  hoods  helped  us  with  two  things ,COMMA one ,COMMA we  could  easily  erase  their  heads .PERIOD and  we  also  put  tracking  markers  on  their  heads  so  we  could  recreate  the  camera  motion  and  the  lens  optics  from  the  set .PERIOD but  now  we  needed  to  get  brad  's  performance  to  drive  our  virtual  benjamin .PERIOD and  so  we  edited  the  footage  that  was  shot  on  location  with  the  rest  of  the  cast  and  the  body  actors  and  about  six  months  later  we  brought  brad  onto  a  sound  stage  in  los  angeles  and  he  watched  on  the  screen .PERIOD his  job ,COMMA then ,COMMA was  to  become  benjamin .PERIOD and  so  we  looped  the  scenes .PERIOD he  watched  again  and  again .PERIOD we  encouraged  him  to  improvise .PERIOD and  he  took  benjamin  into  interesting  and  unusual  places  that  we  did  n't  think  he  was  going  to  go .PERIOD we  shot  him  with  four  hd  cameras  so  we'd  get  multiple  views  of  him  and  then  david  would  choose  the  take  of  brad  being  benjamin  that  he  thought  best  matched  the  footage  with  the  rest  of  the  cast .PERIOD from  there  we  went  into  a  process  called  image  analysis .PERIOD and  so  here ,COMMA you  can  see  again ,COMMA the  chosen  take .PERIOD and  you  are  seeing ,COMMA now ,COMMA that  data  being  transposed  on  to  ben  87 .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA what  's  interesting  about  this  is  we  used  something  called  image  analysis ,COMMA which  is  taking  timings  from  different  components  of  benjamin  's  face .PERIOD and  so  we  could  choose ,COMMA say ,COMMA his  left  eyebrow .PERIOD and  the  software  would  tell  us  that ,COMMA well ,COMMA in  frame  14  the  left  eyebrow  begins  to  move  from  here  to  here ,COMMA and  it  concludes  moving  in  frame  32 .PERIOD and  so  we  could  choose  numbers  of  positions  on  the  face  to  pull  that  data  from .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA the  sauce  i  talked  about  with  our  technology  stew ,COMMA that  secret  sauce  was ,COMMA effectively ,COMMA software  that  allowed  us  to  match  the  performance  footage  of  brad  in  live  action  with  our  database  of  aged  benjamin ,COMMA the  facs  shapes  that  we  had .PERIOD on  a  frame-by-frame  basis ,COMMA we  could  actually  reconstruct  a  3d  head  that  exactly  matched  the  performance  of  brad .PERIOD so  this  was  how  the  finished  shot  appeared  in  the  film .PERIOD and  here  you  can  see  the  body  actor .PERIOD and  then  this  is  what  we  called  the  dead  head ,COMMA no  reference  to  jerry  garcia .PERIOD and  then  here  's  the  reconstructed  performance  now  with  the  timings  of  the  performance .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA again ,COMMA the  final  shot .PERIOD it  was  a  long  process .PERIOD the  next  section  here ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  just  blast  through  this ,COMMA because  we  could  do  a  whole  tedtalk  on  the  next  several  slides .PERIOD we  had  to  create  a  lighting  system .PERIOD so  really ,COMMA a  big  part  of  our  processes  was  creating  a  lighting  environment  for  every  single  location  that  benjamin  had  to  appear  so  that  we  could  put  ben  's  head  into  any  scene  and  it  would  exactly  match  the  lighting  that  's  on  the  other  actors  in  the  real  world .PERIOD we  also  had  to  create  an  eye  system .PERIOD we  found  the  old  adage ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA the  eyes  are  the  window  to  the  soul ,COMMA absolutely  true .PERIOD so  the  key  here  was  to  keep  everybody  looking  in  ben  's  eyes .PERIOD and  if  you  could  feel  the  warmth ,COMMA and  feel  the  humanity ,COMMA and  feel  his  intent  coming  through  the  eyes ,COMMA then  we  would  succeed .PERIOD so  we  had  one  person  focused  on  the  eye  system  for  almost  two  full  years .PERIOD we  also  had  to  create  a  mouth  system .PERIOD we  worked  from  dental  molds  of  brad .PERIOD we  had  to  age  the  teeth  over  time .PERIOD we  also  had  to  create  an  articulating  tongue  that  allowed  him  to  enunciate  his  words .PERIOD there  was  a  whole  system  written  in  software  to  articulate  the  tongue .PERIOD we  had  one  person  devoted  to  the  tongue  for  about  nine  months .PERIOD he  was  very  popular .PERIOD skin  displacement ,COMMA another  big  deal .PERIOD the  skin  had  to  be  absolutely  accurate .PERIOD he  's  also  in  an  old  age  home ,COMMA he  's  in  a  nursing  home  around  other  old  people ,COMMA so  he  had  to  look  exactly  the  same  as  the  others .PERIOD so ,COMMA lots  of  work  on  skin  deformation ,COMMA you  can  see  in  some  of  these  cases  it  works ,COMMA in  some  cases  it  looks  bad .PERIOD this  is  a  very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very  early  test  in  our  process .PERIOD so ,COMMA effectively  we  created  a  digital  puppet  that  brad  pitt  could  operate  with  his  own  face .PERIOD there  were  no  animators  necessary  to  come  in  and  interpret  behavior  or  enhance  his  performance .PERIOD there  was  something  that  we  encountered ,COMMA though ,COMMA that  we  ended  up  calling  the  digital  botox  effect .PERIOD so ,COMMA as  things  went  through  this  process ,COMMA fincher  would  always  say ,COMMA it  sandblasts  the  edges  off  of  the  performance .PERIOD and  thing  our  process  and  the  technology  could  n't  do ,COMMA is  they  could  n't  understand  intent ,COMMA the  intent  of  the  actor .PERIOD so  it  sees  a  smile  as  a  smile .PERIOD it  does  n't  recognize  an  ironic  smile ,COMMA or  a  happy  smile ,COMMA or  a  frustrated  smile .PERIOD so  it  did  take  humans  to  kind  of  push  it  one  way  or  another .PERIOD but  we  ended  up  calling  the  entire  process  and  all  the  technology  emotion  capture ,COMMA as  opposed  to  just  motion  capture .PERIOD take  another  look .PERIOD brad  pitt ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  heard  momma  and  tizzy  whisper ,COMMA and  they  said  i  was  gonna  die  soon .PERIOD but .PERIOD maybe  not .PERIOD eu ,COMMA that  's  how  to  create  a  digital  human  in  18  minutes .PERIOD a  couple  of  quick  factoids .PERIOD it  really  took  155  people  over  two  years ,COMMA and  we  did  n't  even  talk  about  60  hairstyles  and  an  all-digital  haircut .PERIOD but ,COMMA that  is  benjamin .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD and  i  feel  like  this  whole  evening  has  been  very  amazing  to  me .PERIOD i  feel  it  's  sort  of  like  the  vimalakirti  sutra ,COMMA an  ancient  work  from  ancient  india  in  which  the  buddha  appears  at  the  beginning  and  a  whole  bunch  of  people  come  to  see  him  from  the  biggest  city  in  the  area ,COMMA vaishali ,COMMA and  they  bring  some  sort  of  jeweled  parasols  to  make  an  offering  to  him .PERIOD all  the  young  people ,COMMA actually ,COMMA from  the  city .PERIOD the  old  fogeys  do  n't  come  because  they  're  mad  at  buddha ,COMMA because  when  he  came  to  their  city  he  accepted ,COMMA he  always  accepts  the  first  invitation  that  comes  to  him ,COMMA from  whoever  it  is ,COMMA and  the  local  geisha ,COMMA a  movie-star  sort  of  person ,COMMA raced  the  elders  of  the  city  in  a  chariot  and  invited  him  first .PERIOD so  he  was  hanging  out  with  the  movie  star ,COMMA and  of  course  they  were  grumbling ,COMMA he  's  supposed  to  be  religious  and  all  this .PERIOD what  's  he  doing  over  there  at  amrapali  's  house  with  all  his  500  monks ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD they  were  all  grumbling ,COMMA and  so  they  boycotted  him .PERIOD they  would  n't  go  listen  to  him .PERIOD but  the  young  people  all  came .PERIOD and  they  brought  this  kind  of  a  jeweled  parasol ,COMMA and  they  put  it  on  the  ground .PERIOD and  as  soon  as  they  had  laid  all  these ,COMMA all  their  big  stack  of  these  jeweled  parasols  that  they  used  to  carry  in  ancient  india ,COMMA he  performed  a  kind  of  special  effect  which  made  it  into  a  giant  planetarium ,COMMA the  wonder  of  the  universe .PERIOD everyone  looked  in  that ,COMMA and  they  saw  in  there  the  total  interconnectedness  of  all  life  in  all  universes .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA in  the  buddhist  cosmos  there  are  millions  and  billions  of  planets  with  human  life  on  it ,COMMA and  enlightened  beings  can  see  the  life  on  all  the  other  planets .PERIOD so  they  do  n't ,COMMA when  they  look  out  and  they  see  those  lights  that  you  showed  in  the  sky ,COMMA they  do  n't  just  see  sort  of  pieces  of  matter  burning  or  rocks  or  flames  or  gases  exploding .PERIOD they  actually  see  landscapes  and  human  beings  and  gods  and  dragons  and  serpent  beings  and  goddesses  and  things  like  that .PERIOD he  made  that  special  effect  at  the  beginning  to  get  everyone  to  think  about  interconnection  and  interconnectedness  and  how  everything  in  life  was  totally  interconnected .PERIOD and  then  leilei ,COMMA i  know  his  other  name ,COMMA told  us  about  interconnection ,COMMA and  how  we  're  all  totally  interconnected  here ,COMMA and  how  we've  all  known  each  other .PERIOD and  of  course  in  the  buddhist  universe ,COMMA we've  already  done  this  already  billions  of  times  in  many ,COMMA many  lifetimes  in  the  past .PERIOD and  i  did  n't  give  the  talk  always .PERIOD you  did ,COMMA and  we  had  to  watch  you ,COMMA and  so  forth .PERIOD and  we  're  all  still  trying  to ,COMMA i  guess  we  're  all  trying  to  become  tedsters ,COMMA if  that  's  a  modern  form  of  enlightenment .PERIOD i  guess  so .PERIOD because  in  a  way ,COMMA if  a  tedster  relates  to  all  the  interconnectedness  of  all  the  computers  and  everything ,COMMA it  's  the  forging  of  a  mass  awareness ,COMMA of  where  everybody  can  really  know  everything  that  's  going  on  everywhere  in  the  planet .PERIOD and  therefore  it  will  become  intolerable ,COMMA what  compassion  is ,COMMA is  where  it  will  become  intolerable  for  us ,COMMA totally  intolerable  that  we  sit  here  in  comfort  and  in  pleasure  and  enjoying  the  life  of  the  mind  or  whatever  it  is ,COMMA and  there  are  people  who  are  absolutely  riddled  with  disease  and  they  cannot  have  a  bite  of  food  and  they  have  no  place ,COMMA or  they  're  being  brutalized  by  some  terrible  person  and  so  forth .PERIOD it  just  becomes  intolerable .PERIOD with  all  of  us  knowing  everything ,COMMA we  're  kind  of  forced  by  technology  to  become  buddhas  or  something ,COMMA to  become  enlightened .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA we  all  will  be  deeply  disappointed  when  we  do .PERIOD because  we  think  that  because  we  are  kind  of  tired  of  what  we  do ,COMMA a  little  bit  tired ,COMMA we  do  suffer .PERIOD we  do  enjoy  our  misery  in  a  certain  way .PERIOD we  distract  ourselves  from  our  misery  by  running  around  somewhere ,COMMA but  basically  we  all  have  this  common  misery  that  we  are  sort  of  stuck  inside  our  skins  and  everyone  else  is  out  there .PERIOD and  occasionally  we  get  together  with  another  person  stuck  in  their  skin  and  the  two  of  us  enjoy  each  other ,COMMA and  each  one  tries  to  get  out  of  their  own ,COMMA and  ultimately  it  fails  of  course ,COMMA and  then  we  're  back  into  this  thing .PERIOD because  our  egocentric  perception ,COMMA from  the  buddha  's  point  of  view ,COMMA misperception ,COMMA is  that  all  we  are  is  what  is  inside  our  skin .PERIOD and  it  's  inside  and  outside ,COMMA self  and  other ,COMMA and  other  is  all  very  different .PERIOD and  everyone  here  is  unfortunately  carrying  that  habitual  perception ,COMMA a  little  bit ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ,COMMA someone  sitting  next  to  you  in  a  seat ,COMMA that  's  ok  because  you  're  in  a  theater ,COMMA but  if  you  were  sitting  on  a  park  bench  and  someone  came  up  and  sat  that  close  to  you ,COMMA you'd  freak  out .PERIOD what  do  they  want  from  me ?QUESTIONMARK like ,COMMA who  's  that ?QUESTIONMARK and  so  you  would  n't  sit  that  close  to  another  person  because  of  your  notion  that  it  's  you  versus  the  universe ,COMMA that  's  all  buddha  discovered .PERIOD because  that  cosmic  basic  idea  that  it  is  us  all  alone ,COMMA each  of  us ,COMMA and  everyone  else  is  different ,COMMA then  that  puts  us  in  an  impossible  situation ,COMMA does  n't  it ?QUESTIONMARK who  is  it  who  's  going  to  get  enough  attention  from  the  world ?QUESTIONMARK who  's  going  to  get  enough  out  of  the  world ?QUESTIONMARK who  's  not  going  to  be  overrun  by  an  infinite  number  of  other  beings ,COMMA if  you  're  different  from  all  the  other  beings ?QUESTIONMARK so  where  compassion  comes  is  where  you  surprisingly  discover  you  lose  yourself  in  some  way ,COMMA through  art ,COMMA through  meditation ,COMMA through  understanding ,COMMA through  knowledge  actually ,COMMA knowing  that  you  have  no  such  boundary ,COMMA knowing  your  interconnectedness  with  other  beings .PERIOD you  can  experience  yourself  as  the  other  beings  when  you  see  through  the  delusion  of  being  separated  from  them .PERIOD when  you  do  that ,COMMA you  're  forced  to  feel  what  they  feel .PERIOD luckily ,COMMA they  say ,COMMA i  still  am  not  sure ,COMMA but  luckily ,COMMA they  say  that  when  you  reach  that  point  because  some  people  have  said  in  the  buddhist  literature ,COMMA they  say ,COMMA oh  who  would  really  want  to  be  compassionate ?QUESTIONMARK how  awful .PERIOD i  'm  so  miserable  on  my  own .PERIOD my  head  is  aching .PERIOD my  bones  are  aching .PERIOD i  go  from  birth  to  death .PERIOD i  'm  never  satisfied .PERIOD i  never  have  enough ,COMMA even  if  i  'm  a  billionaire ,COMMA i  do  n't  have  enough .PERIOD i  need  a  hundred  billion  so  i  'm  like  that .PERIOD imagine  if  i  had  to  feel  even  a  hundred  other  people  's  suffering .PERIOD it  would  be  terrible .PERIOD but  apparently ,COMMA this  is  a  strange  paradox  of  life .PERIOD when  you  're  no  longer  locked  in  yourself ,COMMA and  as  the  wisdom  or  the  intelligence  or  the  scientific  knowledge  of  the  nature  of  the  world ,COMMA that  enables  you  to  let  your  mind  spread  out ,COMMA and  empathize ,COMMA and  enhance  the  basic  human  ability  of  empathizing ,COMMA and  realizing  that  you  are  the  other  being ,COMMA somehow  by  that  opening ,COMMA you  can  see  the  deeper  nature  of  life .PERIOD and  you  can ,COMMA you  get  away  from  this  terrible  iron  circle  of  i ,COMMA me ,COMMA me ,COMMA mine ,COMMA like  the  beatles  used  to  sing .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA we  really  learned  everything  in  the  60s .PERIOD too  bad  nobody  ever  woke  up  to  it ,COMMA and  they've  been  trying  to  suppress  it  since  then .PERIOD i ,COMMA me ,COMMA me ,COMMA mine .PERIOD it  's  like  a  perfect  song ,COMMA that  song .PERIOD a  perfect  teaching .PERIOD but  when  we  're  relieved  from  that ,COMMA we  somehow  then  become  interested  in  all  the  other  beings .PERIOD and  we  feel  ourselves  differently .PERIOD it  's  totally  strange .PERIOD it  's  totally  strange .PERIOD the  dalai  lama  always  likes  to  say ,COMMA he  says  that  when  you  give  birth  in  your  mind  to  the  idea  of  compassion ,COMMA it  's  because  you  realize  that  you  yourself  and  your  pains  and  pleasures  are  finally  too  small  a  theater  for  your  intelligence .PERIOD it  's  really  too  boring  whether  you  feel  like  this  or  like  that ,COMMA or  what ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA and  the  more  you  focus  on  how  you  feel ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA the  worse  it  gets .PERIOD like ,COMMA even  when  you  're  having  a  good  time ,COMMA when  is  the  good  time  over ?QUESTIONMARK the  good  time  is  over  when  you  think ,COMMA how  good  is  it ?QUESTIONMARK and  then  it  's  never  good  enough .PERIOD i  love  that  leilei  said  that  the  way  of  helping  those  who  are  suffering  badly  on  the  physical  plane  or  on  other  planes  is  having  a  good  time ,COMMA doing  it  by  having  a  good  time .PERIOD i  think  the  dalai  lama  should  have  heard  that .PERIOD i  wish  he'd  been  there  to  hear  that .PERIOD he  once  told  me ,COMMA he  looked  kind  of  sad .PERIOD he  worries  very  much  about  the  haves  and  have-nots .PERIOD he  looked  a  little  sad ,COMMA because  he  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA a  hundred  years  ago ,COMMA they  went  and  took  everything  away  from  the  haves .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA the  big  communist  revolutions ,COMMA russia  and  china  and  so  forth .PERIOD they  took  it  all  away  by  violence ,COMMA saying  they  were  going  to  give  it  to  everyone ,COMMA and  then  they  were  even  worse .PERIOD they  did  n't  help  at  all .PERIOD so  what  could  possibly  change  this  terrible  gap  that  has  opened  up  in  the  world  today ?QUESTIONMARK and  so  then  he  looks  at  me .PERIOD so  i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  're  all  in  this  yourself .PERIOD you  teach ,COMMA it  's  generosity ,COMMA was  all  i  could  think  of .PERIOD what  is  virtue ?QUESTIONMARK but  of  course ,COMMA what  you  said ,COMMA i  think  the  key  to  saving  the  world ,COMMA the  key  to  compassion  is  that  it  is  more  fun .PERIOD it  should  be  done  by  fun .PERIOD generosity  is  more  fun .PERIOD that  's  the  key .PERIOD everybody  has  the  wrong  idea .PERIOD they  think  buddha  was  so  boring ,COMMA and  they  're  so  surprised  when  they  meet  dalai  lama  and  he  's  fairly  jolly .PERIOD even  though  his  people  are  being  genocided ,COMMA and  believe  me ,COMMA he  feels  every  blow  on  every  old  nun  's  head ,COMMA in  every  chinese  prison .PERIOD he  feels  it .PERIOD he  feels  the  way  they  are  harvesting  yaks  nowadays .PERIOD i  wo  n't  even  say  what  they  do .PERIOD but  he  feels  it .PERIOD and  yet  he  's  very  jolly .PERIOD he  's  extremely  jolly .PERIOD because  when  you  open  up  like  that ,COMMA then  you  cannot  just ,COMMA what  good  does  it  do  to  add  being  miserable  with  others  misery ?QUESTIONMARK you  have  to  find  some  vision  where  you  see  how  hopeful  it  is ,COMMA how  it  can  be  changed .PERIOD look  at  that  beautiful  thing  chiho  showed  us .PERIOD she  scared  us  with  the  lava  man .PERIOD she  scared  us  with  the  lava  man  is  coming ,COMMA then  the  tsunami  is  coming ,COMMA but  then  finally  there  were  flowers  and  trees ,COMMA and  it  was  very  beautiful .PERIOD it  's  really  lovely .PERIOD so ,COMMA compassion  means  to  feel  the  feelings  of  others ,COMMA and  the  human  being  actually  is  compassion .PERIOD the  human  being  is  almost  out  of  time .PERIOD the  human  being  is  compassion  because  what  is  our  brain  for ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA jim  's  brain  is  memorizing  the  almanac .PERIOD but  he  could  memorize  all  the  needs  of  all  the  beings  that  he  is ,COMMA he  will ,COMMA he  did .PERIOD he  could  memorize  all  kinds  of  fantastic  things  to  help  many  beings .PERIOD and  he  would  have  tremendous  fun  doing  that .PERIOD so  the  first  person  who  gets  happy ,COMMA when  you  stop  focusing  on  the  self-centered  situation  of ,COMMA how  happy  am  i ,COMMA where  you  're  always  dissatisfied ,COMMA as  mick  jagger  told  us .PERIOD you  never  get  any  satisfaction  that  way .PERIOD so  then  you  decide ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  'm  sick  of  myself .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  think  of  how  other  people  can  be  happy .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  get  up  in  the  morning  and  think ,COMMA what  can  i  do  for  even  one  other  person ,COMMA even  a  dog ,COMMA my  dog ,COMMA my  cat ,COMMA my  pet ,COMMA my  butterfly ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  first  person  who  gets  happy  when  you  do  that ,COMMA you  do  n't  do  anything  for  anybody  else ,COMMA but  you  get  happier ,COMMA you  yourself ,COMMA because  your  whole  perception  broadens  and  you  suddenly  see  the  whole  world  and  all  of  the  people  in  it .PERIOD and  you  realize  that  this ,COMMA being  with  these  people ,COMMA is  the  flower  garden  that  chiho  showed  us .PERIOD it  is  nirvana .PERIOD and  my  time  is  up .PERIOD and  i  know  the  ted  commandments .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  started  juggling  a  long  time  ago ,COMMA but  long  before  that ,COMMA i  was  a  golfer ,COMMA and  that  's  what  i  was ,COMMA a  golfer .PERIOD and  as  a  golfer  and  as  a  kid ,COMMA one  of  the  things  that  really  sort  of  seeped  into  my  pores ,COMMA that  i  sort  of  lived  my  whole  life ,COMMA is  process .PERIOD and  it  's  the  process  of  learning  things .PERIOD one  of  the  great  things  was  that  my  father  was  an  avid  golfer ,COMMA but  he  was  lefty .PERIOD and  he  had  a  real  passion  for  golf ,COMMA and  he  also  created  this  whole  mythology  about  ben  hogan  and  various  things .PERIOD well ,COMMA i  learned  a  lot  about  interesting  things  that  i  knew  nothing  about  at  the  time ,COMMA but  grew  to  know  stuff  about .PERIOD and  that  was  the  mythology  of  skill .PERIOD so ,COMMA one  of  the  things  that  i  love  to  do  is  to  explore  skill .PERIOD and  since  richard  put  me  on  this  whole  thing  with  music ,COMMA i  'm  supposed  to  actually  be  doing  a  project  with  tod  machover  with  the  mit  media  lab ,COMMA it  relates  a  lot  to  music .PERIOD but  tod  could  n't  come  and  the  project  is  sort  of  somewhere ,COMMA i  'm  not  sure  whether  it  's  happening  the  way  we  thought ,COMMA or  not .PERIOD but  i  'm  going  to  explore  skill ,COMMA and  juggling ,COMMA and  basically  visual  music ,COMMA i  guess .PERIOD ok ,COMMA you  can  start  the  music ,COMMA thanks .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD now ,COMMA juggling  can  be  a  lot  of  fun .PERIOD play  with  skill  and  play  with  space ,COMMA play  with  rhythm .PERIOD and  you  can  turn  the  mike  on  now .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  do  a  couple  of  pieces .PERIOD i  do  a  big  piece  in  a  triangle  and  these  are  three  sections  from  it .PERIOD part  of  the  challenge  was  to  try  to  understand  rhythm  and  space  using  not  just  my  hands ,COMMA because  a  lot  of  juggling  is  hand-oriented ,COMMA but  using  the  rhythm  of  my  body  and  feet ,COMMA and  controlling  the  balls  with  my  feet .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  next  section  was  an  attempt  to  explore  space .PERIOD you  see ,COMMA i  think  richard  said  something  about  people  that  are  against  something .PERIOD well ,COMMA a  lot  of  people  think  jugglers  defy  gravity  or  do  stuff .PERIOD well ,COMMA i  kind  of ,COMMA from  my  childhood  and  golf  and  all  that ,COMMA it  's  a  process  of  joining  with  forces .PERIOD and  so  what  i'd  like  to  do  is  try  to  figure  out  how  to  join  with  the  space  through  the  technique .PERIOD so  juggling  gravity ,COMMA up ,COMMA down .PERIOD if  you  figure  out  what  up  and  down  really  are ,COMMA it  's  a  complex  physical  set  of  skills  to  be  able  to  throw  a  ball  down  and  up  and  everything ,COMMA but  then  you  add  in  sideways .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  look  at  it  somewhat  as  a  way ,COMMA when  you  learn  juggling  what  you  learn  is  how  to  feel  with  your  eyes ,COMMA and  see  with  your  hands  because  you  're  not  looking  at  your  hands ,COMMA you  're  looking  at  where  the  balls  are  or  you  're  looking  at  the  audience .PERIOD so  this  next  part  is  really  a  way  of  understanding  space  and  rhythm ,COMMA with  the  obvious  reference  to  the  feet .PERIOD but  it  's  also  time ,COMMA where  the  feet  were ,COMMA where  the  balls  were .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD so ,COMMA visual  music ,COMMA rhythm  and  complexity .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  build  towards  complexity  now .PERIOD juggling  three  balls  is  simple  and  normal .PERIOD excuse  me .PERIOD we  're  jugglers ,COMMA ok .PERIOD and  remember ,COMMA you  're  transposing ,COMMA you  're  getting  into  a  subculture  here .PERIOD and  juggling ,COMMA the  balls  cross  and  all  that .PERIOD ok ,COMMA if  you  keep  them  in  their  assigned  paths  you  get  parallel  lines  of  different  heights ,COMMA but  then  hopefully  even  rhythm .PERIOD and  you  can  change  the  rhythm ,COMMA good ,COMMA michael .PERIOD you  can  change  the  rhythm ,COMMA if  you  get  out  of  the  lights .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK change  the  rhythm ,COMMA so  it  's  even .PERIOD or  you  can  go  back  and  change  the  height .PERIOD now ,COMMA skill .PERIOD but  you  're  boxed  in ,COMMA if  you  can  only  do  it  up  and  down  that  way .PERIOD so ,COMMA you've  got  to  go  after  the  space  down  there .PERIOD ok ,COMMA then  you've  got  to  combine  them ,COMMA because  then  you  have  the  whole  spatial  palette  in  front  of  you .PERIOD and  then  you  get  crazy .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  'm  actually  going  to  ask  you  to  try  something ,COMMA so  you've  got  to  pay  attention .PERIOD complexity: .PERIOD if  you  spend  enough  time  doing  something ,COMMA time  slows  down  or  your  skill  increases ,COMMA so  your  perceptions  change .PERIOD it  's  learning  skills ,COMMA like  being  in  a  high-speed  car  crash .PERIOD things  slow  down  as  you  learn ,COMMA as  you  learn ,COMMA as  you  learn .PERIOD you  may  not  be  able  to  affect  it ,COMMA it  almost  drifts  on  you .PERIOD it  goes .PERIOD but  that  's  the  closest  approximation  i  can  have  to  it .PERIOD so ,COMMA complexity .PERIOD now ,COMMA how  many  here  are  jugglers ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA so  most  of  you  are  going  to  have  a  similar  reaction  to  this .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK and  whoever  laughed  there ,COMMA you  understood  it  completely ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA it  looks  like  a  mess .PERIOD it  looks  like  a  mess  with  a  guy  there ,COMMA who  's  got  his  hands  around  that  mess ,COMMA ok .PERIOD well ,COMMA that  's  what  juggling  is  about ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  being  able  to  do  something  that  other  people  cannot  do  or  cannot  understand .PERIOD all  right .PERIOD so ,COMMA that  's  one  way  of  doing  it ,COMMA which  is  five  balls  down .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK another  way  is  the  outside .PERIOD and  you  could  play  with  the  rhythm .PERIOD same  pattern .PERIOD make  it  faster  and  smaller .PERIOD make  it  wider .PERIOD make  it  narrower .PERIOD bring  it  back  up .PERIOD ok .PERIOD it  's  done .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD now ,COMMA what  i  wanted  to  get  to  is  that  you  're  all  very  bright ,COMMA very  tactile .PERIOD i  have  no  idea  how  computer-oriented  or  three-dimensionally-oriented  you  are ,COMMA but  let  's  try  something .PERIOD ok ,COMMA so  since  you  all  do  n't  understand  what  the  five-ball  pattern  is ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  give  you  a  little  clue .PERIOD enough  of  a  clue ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA you  get  the  pattern ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD you  're  not  getting  off  that  easy .PERIOD all  right ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA do  me  a  favor ,COMMA follow  the  ball  that  i  ask  you  to  follow .PERIOD green .PERIOD yellow .PERIOD pink .PERIOD white .PERIOD ok ,COMMA you  can  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD now ,COMMA let  's  actually  learn  something .PERIOD actually ,COMMA let  me  put  you  in  that  area  of  learning ,COMMA which  is  very  insecure .PERIOD you  want  to  do  it ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD hands  out  in  front  of  you .PERIOD palms  up ,COMMA together .PERIOD what  you  're  going  to  learn  is  this .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so  what  i  want  you  to  do  is  just  listen  to  me  and  do  it .PERIOD index  finger ,COMMA middle  finger ,COMMA ring ,COMMA little .PERIOD little ,COMMA ring ,COMMA middle ,COMMA index .PERIOD and  then  open .PERIOD finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD a  little  bit  faster .PERIOD finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD all  right .PERIOD a  lot  of  different  learning  processes  going  on  in  here .PERIOD one  learning  process  that  i  see  is  this ,COMMA ok .PERIOD another  learning  process  that  i  see  is  this ,COMMA ok .PERIOD so ,COMMA everybody  take  a  deep  breath  in ,COMMA breath  out .PERIOD ok .PERIOD now ,COMMA one  more  time ,COMMA and ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD open .PERIOD finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD ok .PERIOD shake  your  hands  out .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  assume  a  lot  of  you  spend  a  lot  of  time  at  a  computer .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA what  you  're  doing  is ,COMMA you  're  going  la ,COMMA la ,COMMA la ,COMMA and  you  're  getting  this .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so  that  's  exactly  what  i  'm  going  to  ask  you  to  do ,COMMA but  in  a  slightly  different  way .PERIOD you  're  going  to  combine  it .PERIOD so  what  i  want  you  to  do  is ,COMMA fingers .PERIOD i  'll  tell  you  what  to  do  with  your  fingers ,COMMA same  thing .PERIOD but  i  want  you  to  do  is  also ,COMMA with  your  eyes ,COMMA is  follow  the  colored  ball  that  i  ask  you  to  follow .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK here  we  go .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  're  going  to  start  off  looking  at  the  white  ball ,COMMA and  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  which  color ,COMMA and  i  'm  also  going  to  tell  you  to  go  with  your  fingers .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so  white  ball  and ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD pink .PERIOD finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD green .PERIOD finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD yellow .PERIOD finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA pink  or  finger .PERIOD pink ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger ,COMMA finger .PERIOD all  right .PERIOD how  did  you  do ?QUESTIONMARK well ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD the  reason  i  wanted  you  to  do  this  is  because  that  's  actually  what  most  people  face  throughout  their  lives ,COMMA a  moment  of  learning ,COMMA a  moment  of  challenge .PERIOD it  's  a  moment  that  you  cannot  make  sense  of .PERIOD why  the  hell  should  i  learn  this ?QUESTIONMARK ok ?QUESTIONMARK does  it  really  have  anything  to  do  with  anything  in  my  life ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ,COMMA i  cannot  decipher ,COMMA is  it  fun ?QUESTIONMARK is  it  challenging ?QUESTIONMARK am  i  supposed  to  cheat ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ,COMMA what  are  you  supposed  to  do ?QUESTIONMARK you've  got  somebody  up  here  who  is  the  operative  principle  of  doing  that  for  his  whole  life .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK trying  to  figure  that  stuff  out .PERIOD but  is  it  going  to  get  you  anywhere ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  just  a  moment .PERIOD that  's  all  it  is ,COMMA a  moment .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  going  to  change  the  script  for  one  second .PERIOD just  let  me  do  this .PERIOD i  do  n't  need  music  for  it .PERIOD talking  about  time  in  a  moment .PERIOD there  's  a  piece  that  i  recently  developed  which  was  all  about  that ,COMMA a  moment .PERIOD and  what  i  do  as  a  creative  artist  is  i  develop  vocabularies  or  languages  of  moving  objects .PERIOD what  i've  done  for  you  here ,COMMA i  developed  a  lot  of  those  tricks  and  i  put  the  choreography  together ,COMMA but  they  're  not  original  techniques .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  start  showing  you  some  original  techniques  that  come  from  the  work  that  i've  developed .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA a  moment ,COMMA how  would  you  define  a  moment ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA as  a  juggler ,COMMA what  i  wanted  to  do  was  create  something  that  was  representational  of  a  moment .PERIOD ahhh .PERIOD all  right ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  get  on  my  knees  and  do  it .PERIOD so ,COMMA a  moment .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK and  then ,COMMA what  i  did  as  a  juggler  was  say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA what  can  i  do  to  make  that  something  that  is  dependent  on  something  else ,COMMA another  dynamic .PERIOD so ,COMMA a  moment .PERIOD another  moment .PERIOD excuse  me ,COMMA still  getting  there .PERIOD a  moment  that  travels .PERIOD a  moment ,COMMA no ,COMMA we  'll  try  that  again .PERIOD it  separates ,COMMA and  comes  back  together .PERIOD time .PERIOD how  can  you  look  at  time ?QUESTIONMARK and  what  do  you  dedicate  it  to ,COMMA in  exploring  a  particular  thing ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA there  's  something  in  here ,COMMA and  you  can  all  have  a  guess  as  to  what  it  is .PERIOD there  's  a  mystery .PERIOD there  's  a  mystery  in  the  moment .PERIOD and  it  has  to  settle .PERIOD and  then  it  's  dependent  on  something  else .PERIOD and  then  it  comes  to  rest .PERIOD just  a  little  thing  about  time .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  has  expanded  into  a  much  bigger  piece .PERIOD because  i  use  ramps  of  different  parabolas  that  i  roll  the  balls  on  while  i  'm  keeping  time  with  this .PERIOD but  i  just  thought  i'd  talk  about  a  moment .PERIOD all  right .PERIOD ok .PERIOD can  we  show  the  video  of  the  triangle ?QUESTIONMARK are  we  ready  to  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK yes ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  the  piece  that  i  told  you  about .PERIOD it  's  a  much  bigger  piece  that  i  do  exploring  the  space  of  a  geometric  triangle .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD the  only  thing  i  'll  say  about  the  last  session  is ,COMMA you  ever  try  juggling  and  driving  the  car  with  your  knees  at  120  miles  an  hour ?QUESTIONMARK the  only  other  thing  is ,COMMA it  was  a  real  shock .PERIOD i  always  drove  motorcycles .PERIOD and  when  i  bought  my  first  car ,COMMA it  shocked  me  that  it  cost  three  times  more  than  my  parents  house .PERIOD interesting .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA balance ,COMMA constant  movement  to  find  an  approach  to  stillness .PERIOD cheating .PERIOD balance ,COMMA making  up  the  rules  so  you  cannot  cheat ,COMMA so  you  learn  to  approach  stillness  with  different  parts  of  your  body .PERIOD to  have  a  conversation  with  it .PERIOD to  speak .PERIOD to  listen .PERIOD hup .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  's  dependent  on  rhythm ,COMMA and  keeping  a  center  of  balance .PERIOD when  it  falls ,COMMA going  underneath .PERIOD so ,COMMA there  's  a  rhythm  to  it .PERIOD the  rhythm  can  get  much  smaller .PERIOD as  your  skill  increases ,COMMA you  learn  to  find  those  tinier  spaces ,COMMA those  tinier  movements .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  show  you  the  beginnings  of  a  piece  that  is  about  balance  in  some  ways ,COMMA and  also ,COMMA oh ,COMMA actually ,COMMA if  you  're  bored ,COMMA not  here ,COMMA here  's  one  use  for  it .PERIOD you  can  go  with  the  sticks  one  music .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD that  has  a  certain  kind  of  balance  to  it ,COMMA which  is  all  about  plumb .PERIOD i  apprenticed  with  a  carpenter  and  learned  about  plumb ,COMMA square  and  level .PERIOD and  they  influenced  that ,COMMA and  this  next  piece ,COMMA which  i  'll  do  a  little  segment  of .PERIOD two  sticks ,COMMA you  can  go  with  it .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD which  is  again  exploring  space ,COMMA or  the  lines  in  space .PERIOD working  with  space  and  the  lines  in  space  in  a  different  way .PERIOD oh ,COMMA let  's  see  here .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  'll  come  back  to  that  in  a  second .PERIOD but  working  with  one  ball ,COMMA now ,COMMA what  if  you  attach  something  to  it ,COMMA or  change  it .PERIOD this  is  a  little  thing  that  i  made  because  i  really  like  the  idea  of  curves  and  balls  together .PERIOD and  then  creating  space  and  the  rhythm  of  space ,COMMA using  the  surface  of  the  balls ,COMMA the  surface  of  the  arms .PERIOD just  a  little  toy .PERIOD which  leads  me  to  the  next  thing ,COMMA which  is ,COMMA what  have  i  got  here ?QUESTIONMARK ok .PERIOD all  right .PERIOD i  'm  actually  leading  up  to  something ,COMMA the  newest  thing  that  i  'm  working  on .PERIOD this  is  not  it .PERIOD this  is  exploring  geometry  and  the  rhythm  of  shape .PERIOD now ,COMMA what  i  just  did  was  i  worked  with  the  mathematics ,COMMA the  diameter  and  the  circumference .PERIOD sometimes  these  pieces  are  mathematical ,COMMA in  that  way  that  i  look  at  a  shape  and  say ,COMMA what  about  if  i  use  this  and  this  and  this .PERIOD sometimes  what  happens  in  life  affects  my  choice  of  objects  that  i  try  to  work  with .PERIOD the  next  piece  that  i  'm  going  to  do ,COMMA which  is  the  cylinders  piece ,COMMA if  you  want  to  get  that  up ,COMMA it  has  to  do  with  cylinder  seals  from  about  5,000  years  ago ,COMMA which  were  stones  with  designs  that  were  used  to  roll  over  wet  clay  with  all  sorts  of  great  designs .PERIOD i  love  ceramics  and  all  of  that .PERIOD it  's  a  combination  of  that ,COMMA the  beauty  of  that ,COMMA the  shape ,COMMA and  the  stories  that  were  involved  in  it ,COMMA as  well  as  the  fact  that  they  protected  the  contents .PERIOD the  second  influence  on  this  piece  came  from  recycling  and  looking  into  a  tin  can  recycling  bin  and  seeing  all  that  beautiful  emptiness .PERIOD so ,COMMA if  you  want  to  go  with  the  music  for  cylinders .PERIOD talking  about  geometry  and  everything ,COMMA if  you  take  the  circle  and  you  split  it  in  half  -- .PERIOD can  you  run  s-curve  music ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  going  to  do  just  a  short  version  of  it .PERIOD circles  split  in  half  and  rotated ,COMMA and  mythology .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA that  piece  also  has  a  kinetic  sculpture  in  the  middle  of  it ,COMMA and  i  dance  around  a  small  stage  so ,COMMA two  minutes ,COMMA just  to  end ?QUESTIONMARK the  latest  piece  that  i  'm  working  on ,COMMA what  i  love  is  that  i  never  know  what  i  'm  working  on ,COMMA why  i  'm  working  on  it .PERIOD they  're  not  ideas ,COMMA they  're  instincts .PERIOD and  the  latest  thing  that  i  'm  working  on ,COMMA is  something  really ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  what  it  is  yet .PERIOD and  that  's  good .PERIOD i  like  not  to  know  for  as  long  as  possible .PERIOD well ,COMMA because  then  it  tells  me  the  truth ,COMMA instead  of  me  imposing  the  truth .PERIOD and  what  it  is ,COMMA is  working  with  both  positive  and  negative  space  but  also  with  these  curves .PERIOD and  what  it  involves ,COMMA and  i  do  n't  know  if  my  hands  are  too  beaten  up  to  do  it  or  not ,COMMA but  i  'll  do  a  little  bit  of  it .PERIOD it  initially  started  off  with  me  stacking  these  things ,COMMA bunches  of  them ,COMMA and  then  playing  with  the  sense  of  space ,COMMA of  filling  in  the  space .PERIOD and  then  it  started  changing ,COMMA and  become  folding  on  themselves .PERIOD and  then  changing  levels .PERIOD because  my  attempt  is  to  make  visual  instruments ,COMMA not  to  just  make ,COMMA i  'll  try  one  other  thing .PERIOD for  work  in  three  dimensions ,COMMA with  your  perceptions  of  space  and  time .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  exactly  where  it  's  going ,COMMA but  i've  got  a  bit  of  effort  involved  in  this  thing .PERIOD and  it  's  going  to  change  as  i  go  through  it .PERIOD but  i  really  like  it ,COMMA it  feels  right .PERIOD this  may  not  be  the  right  shape ,COMMA and ,COMMA look  at  this  shape ,COMMA and  then  i  'll  show  you  the  first  design  i  ever  put  to  it ,COMMA just  to  see ,COMMA just  to  play ,COMMA because  i  love  all  different  kinds  of  things  to  play  with .PERIOD to  work  with  the  positive  and  negative  in  a  different  way .PERIOD and  to  change ,COMMA and  to  change .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  'm  off  in  my  new  direction  with  this  to  explore  rhythm  and  space .PERIOD we  'll  see  what  i  come  up  with .PERIOD thanks  for  having  me .PERIOD when  i  got  my  current  job ,COMMA i  was  given  a  good  piece  of  advice ,COMMA which  was  to  interview  three  politicians  every  day .PERIOD and  from  that  much  contact  with  politicians ,COMMA i  can  tell  you  they  're  all  emotional  freaks  of  one  sort  or  another .PERIOD they  have  what  i  called  logorrhea  dementia ,COMMA which  is  they  talk  so  much  they  drive  themselves  insane .PERIOD but  what  they  do  have  is  incredible  social  skills .PERIOD when  you  meet  them ,COMMA they  lock  into  you ,COMMA they  look  you  in  the  eye ,COMMA they  invade  your  personal  space ,COMMA they  massage  the  back  of  your  head .PERIOD i  had  dinner  with  a  republican  senator  several  months  ago  who  kept  his  hand  on  my  inner  thigh  throughout  the  whole  meal ,COMMA squeezing  it .PERIOD i  once ,COMMA this  was  years  ago ,COMMA i  saw  ted  kennedy  and  dan  quayle  meet  in  the  well  of  the  senate .PERIOD and  they  were  friends ,COMMA and  they  hugged  each  other  and  they  were  laughing ,COMMA and  their  faces  were  like  this  far  apart .PERIOD and  they  were  moving  and  grinding  and  moving  their  arms  up  and  down  each  other .PERIOD and  i  was  like ,COMMA get  a  room .PERIOD i  do  n't  want  to  see  this .PERIOD but  they  have  those  social  skills .PERIOD another  case ,COMMA last  election  cycle ,COMMA i  was  following  mitt  romney  around  new  hampshire .PERIOD and  he  was  campaigning  with  his  five  perfect  sons ,COMMA bip ,COMMA chip ,COMMA rip ,COMMA zip ,COMMA lip  and  dip .PERIOD and  he  's  going  into  a  diner .PERIOD and  he  goes  into  the  diner ,COMMA introduces  himself  to  a  family  and  says ,COMMA what  village  are  you  from  in  new  hampshire ?QUESTIONMARK and  then  he  describes  the  home  he  owned  in  their  village .PERIOD and  so  he  goes  around  the  room ,COMMA and  then  as  he  's  leaving  the  diner ,COMMA he  first-names  almost  everybody  he  's  just  met .PERIOD i  was  like ,COMMA okay ,COMMA that  's  social  skill .PERIOD but  the  paradox  is ,COMMA when  a  lot  of  these  people  slip  into  the  policy-making  mode ,COMMA that  social  awareness  vanishes  and  they  start  talking  like  accountants .PERIOD so  in  the  course  of  my  career ,COMMA i  have  covered  a  series  of  failures .PERIOD we  sent  economists  in  the  soviet  union  with  privatization  plans  when  it  broke  up ,COMMA and  what  they  really  lacked  was  social  trust .PERIOD we  invaded  iraq  with  a  military  oblivious  to  the  cultural  and  psychological  realities .PERIOD we  had  a  financial  regulatory  regime  based  on  the  assumptions  that  traders  were  rational  creatures  who  would  n't  do  anything  stupid .PERIOD for  30  years ,COMMA i've  been  covering  school  reform  and  we've  basically  reorganized  the  bureaucratic  boxes ,COMMA charters ,COMMA private  schools ,COMMA vouchers ,COMMA but  we've  had  disappointing  results  year  after  year .PERIOD and  the  fact  is ,COMMA people  learn  from  people  they  love .PERIOD and  if  you  're  not  talking  about  the  individual  relationship  between  a  teacher  and  a  student ,COMMA you  're  not  talking  about  that  reality .PERIOD but  that  reality  is  expunged  from  our  policy-making  process .PERIOD and  so  that  's  led  to  a  question  for  me ,COMMA why  are  the  most  socially-attuned  people  on  earth  completely  dehumanized  when  they  think  about  policy ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  came  to  the  conclusion ,COMMA this  is  a  symptom  of  a  larger  problem .PERIOD that ,COMMA for  centuries ,COMMA we've  inherited  a  view  of  human  nature  based  on  the  notion  that  we  're  divided  selves ,COMMA that  reason  is  separated  from  the  emotions  and  that  society  progresses  to  the  extent  that  reason  can  suppress  the  passions .PERIOD and  it  's  led  to  a  view  of  human  nature  that  we  're  rational  individuals  who  respond  in  straightforward  ways  to  incentives .PERIOD and  it  's  led  to  ways  of  seeing  the  world  where  people  try  to  use  the  assumptions  of  physics  to  measure  how  human  behavior  is .PERIOD and  it  's  produced  a  great  amputation ,COMMA a  shallow  view  of  human  nature .PERIOD we  're  really  good  at  talking  about  material  things ,COMMA but  we  're  really  bad  at  talking  about  emotions .PERIOD we  're  really  good  at  talking  about  skills  and  safety  and  health .PERIOD we  're  really  bad  at  talking  about  character .PERIOD alasdair  macintyre ,COMMA the  famous  philosopher ,COMMA said  that ,COMMA we  have  the  concepts  of  the  ancient  morality  of  virtue ,COMMA honor ,COMMA goodness ,COMMA but  we  no  longer  have  a  system  by  which  to  connect  them .PERIOD and  so  this  has  led  to  a  shallow  path  in  politics ,COMMA but  also  in  a  whole  range  of  human  endeavors .PERIOD you  can  see  it  in  the  way  we  raise  our  young  kids .PERIOD you  go  to  an  elementary  school  at  three  in  the  afternoon  and  you  watch  the  kids  come  out ,COMMA and  they  're  wearing  these  80-pound  backpacks .PERIOD if  the  wind  blows  them  over ,COMMA they  're  like  beetles  stuck  there  on  the  ground .PERIOD you  see  these  cars  that  drive  up ,COMMA usually  it  's  saabs  and  audis  and  volvos ,COMMA because  in  certain  neighborhoods  it  's  socially  acceptable  to  have  a  luxury  car ,COMMA so  long  as  it  comes  from  a  country  hostile  to  us .PERIOD foreign  policy ,COMMA that  's  fine .PERIOD they  get  picked  up  by  these  creatures  i've  called  uber-moms ,COMMA who  are  highly  successful  career  women  who  have  taken  time  off  to  make  sure  all  their  kids  get  into  harvard .PERIOD and  you  can  usually  tell  the  uber-moms  because  they  actually  weigh  less  than  their  own  children .PERIOD so  at  the  moment  of  conception ,COMMA they  're  doing  little  butt  exercises .PERIOD babies  flop  out ,COMMA they  're  flashing  mandarin  flashcards  at  the  things .PERIOD dr.iving  them  home ,COMMA and  they  want  them  to  be  enlightened ,COMMA so  they  take  them  to  ben  &amp .PERIOD jerry  's  ice  cream  company  with  its  own  foreign  policy .PERIOD in  one  of  my  books ,COMMA i  joke  that  ben  &amp .PERIOD jerry  's  should  make  a  pacifist  toothpaste ,COMMA does  n't  kill  germs ,COMMA just  asks  them  to  leave .PERIOD it  would  be  a  big  seller .PERIOD and  they  go  to  whole  foods  to  get  their  baby  formula .PERIOD and  whole  foods  is  one  of  those  progressive  grocery  stores  where  all  the  cashiers  look  like  they  're  on  loan  from  amnesty  international .PERIOD they  buy  these  seaweed-based  snacks  there  called  veggie  booty  with  kale ,COMMA which  is  for  kids  who  come  home  and  say ,COMMA mom ,COMMA mom ,COMMA i  want  a  snack  that  'll  help  prevent  colon-rectal  cancer .PERIOD and  so  the  kids  are  raised  in  a  certain  way ,COMMA jumping  through  achievement  hoops  of  the  things  we  can  measure ,COMMA sat  prep ,COMMA oboe ,COMMA soccer  practice .PERIOD they  get  into  competitive  colleges ,COMMA they  get  good  jobs ,COMMA and  sometimes  they  make  a  success  of  themselves  in  a  superficial  manner ,COMMA and  they  make  a  ton  of  money .PERIOD and  sometimes  you  can  see  them  at  vacation  places  like  jackson  hole  or  aspen .PERIOD and  they've  become  elegant  and  slender ,COMMA they  do  n't  really  have  thighs .PERIOD they  just  have  one  elegant  calve  on  top  of  another .PERIOD they  have  kids  of  their  own ,COMMA and  they've  achieved  a  genetic  miracle  by  marrying  beautiful  people ,COMMA so  their  grandmoms  look  like  gertrude  stein ,COMMA their  daughters  looks  like  halle  berry ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  how  they've  done  that .PERIOD they  get  there  and  they  realize  it  's  fashionable  now  to  have  dogs  a  third  as  tall  as  your  ceiling  heights .PERIOD so  they've  got  these  furry  160-pound  dogs ,COMMA all  look  like  velociraptors ,COMMA all  named  after  jane  austen  characters .PERIOD and  then  when  they  get  old ,COMMA they  have  n't  really  developed  a  philosophy  of  life ,COMMA but  they've  decided ,COMMA i've  been  successful  at  everything .PERIOD i  'm  just  not  going  to  die .PERIOD and  so  they  hire  personal  trainers .PERIOD they  're  popping  cialis  like  breath  mints .PERIOD you  see  them  on  the  mountains  up  there .PERIOD they  're  cross-country  skiing  up  the  mountain  with  these  grim  expressions  that  make  dick  cheney  look  like  jerry  lewis .PERIOD and  as  they  whiz  by  you ,COMMA it  's  like  being  passed  by  a  little  iron  raisinet  going  up  the  hill .PERIOD and  so  this  is  part  of  what  life  is ,COMMA but  it  's  not  all  of  what  life  is .PERIOD and  over  the  past  few  years ,COMMA i  think  we've  been  given  a  deeper  view  of  human  nature  and  a  deeper  view  of  who  we  are .PERIOD and  it  's  not  based  on  theology  or  philosophy ,COMMA it  's  in  the  study  of  the  mind ,COMMA across  all  these  spheres  of  research ,COMMA from  neuroscience  to  the  cognitive  scientists ,COMMA behavioral  economists ,COMMA psychologists ,COMMA sociology ,COMMA we  're  developing  a  revolution  in  consciousness .PERIOD and  when  you  synthesize  it  all ,COMMA it  's  giving  us  a  new  view  of  human  nature .PERIOD and  far  from  being  a  coldly  materialistic  view  of  nature ,COMMA it  's  a  new  humanism ,COMMA it  's  a  new  enchantment .PERIOD and  i  think  when  you  synthesize  this  research ,COMMA you  start  with  three  key  insights .PERIOD the  first  insight  is  that  while  the  conscious  mind  writes  the  autobiography  of  our  species ,COMMA the  unconscious  mind  does  most  of  the  work .PERIOD and  so  one  way  to  formulate  that  is  the  human  mind  can  take  in  millions  of  pieces  of  information  a  minute ,COMMA of  which  it  can  be  consciously  aware  of  about  40 .PERIOD and  this  leads  to  oddities .PERIOD one  of  my  favorite  is  that  people  named  dennis  are  disproportionately  likely  to  become  dentists ,COMMA people  named  lawrence  become  lawyers ,COMMA because  unconsciously  we  gravitate  toward  things  that  sound  familiar ,COMMA which  is  why  i  named  my  daughter  president  of  the  united  states  brooks .PERIOD another  finding  is  that  the  unconscious ,COMMA far  from  being  dumb  and  sexualized ,COMMA is  actually  quite  smart .PERIOD so  one  of  the  most  cognitively  demanding  things  we  do  is  buy  furniture .PERIOD it  's  really  hard  to  imagine  a  sofa ,COMMA how  it  's  going  to  look  in  your  house .PERIOD and  the  way  you  should  do  that  is  study  the  furniture ,COMMA let  it  marinate  in  your  mind ,COMMA distract  yourself ,COMMA and  then  a  few  days  later ,COMMA go  with  your  gut ,COMMA because  unconsciously  you've  figured  it  out .PERIOD the  second  insight  is  that  emotions  are  at  the  center  of  our  thinking .PERIOD people  with  strokes  and  lesions  in  the  emotion-processing  parts  of  the  brain  are  not  super  smart ,COMMA they  're  actually  sometimes  quite  helpless .PERIOD and  the  giant  in  the  field  is  in  the  room  tonight  and  is  speaking  tomorrow  morning ,COMMA antonio  damasio .PERIOD and  one  of  the  things  he  's  really  shown  us  is  that  emotions  are  not  separate  from  reason ,COMMA but  they  are  the  foundation  of  reason  because  they  tell  us  what  to  value .PERIOD and  so  reading  and  educating  your  emotions  is  one  of  the  central  activities  of  wisdom .PERIOD now  i  'm  a  middle-aged  guy .PERIOD i  'm  not  exactly  comfortable  with  emotions .PERIOD one  of  my  favorite  brain  stories  described  these  middle-aged  guys .PERIOD they  put  them  into  a  brain  scan  machine ,COMMA this  is  apocryphal  by  the  way ,COMMA but  i  do  n't  care ,COMMA and  they  had  them  watch  a  horror  movie ,COMMA and  then  they  had  them  describe  their  feelings  toward  their  wives .PERIOD and  the  brain  scans  were  identical  in  both  activities .PERIOD it  was  just  sheer  terror .PERIOD so  me  talking  about  emotion  is  like  gandhi  talking  about  gluttony ,COMMA but  it  is  the  central  organizing  process  of  the  way  we  think .PERIOD it  tells  us  what  to  imprint .PERIOD the  brain  is  the  record  of  the  feelings  of  a  life .PERIOD and  the  third  insight  is  that  we  're  not  primarily  self-contained  individuals .PERIOD we  're  social  animals ,COMMA not  rational  animals .PERIOD we  emerge  out  of  relationships ,COMMA and  we  are  deeply  interpenetrated ,COMMA one  with  another .PERIOD and  so  when  we  see  another  person ,COMMA we  reenact  in  our  own  minds  what  we  see  in  their  minds .PERIOD when  we  watch  a  car  chase  in  a  movie ,COMMA it  's  almost  as  if  we  are  subtly  having  a  car  chase .PERIOD when  we  watch  pornography ,COMMA it  's  a  little  like  having  sex ,COMMA though  probably  not  as  good .PERIOD and  we  see  this  when  lovers  walk  down  the  street ,COMMA when  a  crowd  in  egypt  or  tunisia  gets  caught  up  in  an  emotional  contagion ,COMMA the  deep  interpenetration .PERIOD and  this  revolution  in  who  we  are  gives  us  a  different  way  of  seeing ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA politics ,COMMA a  different  way ,COMMA most  importantly ,COMMA of  seeing  human  capital .PERIOD we  are  now  children  of  the  french  enlightenment .PERIOD we  believe  that  reason  is  the  highest  of  the  faculties .PERIOD but  i  think  this  research  shows  that  the  british  enlightenment ,COMMA or  the  scottish  enlightenment ,COMMA with  david  hume ,COMMA adam  smith ,COMMA actually  had  a  better  handle  on  who  we  are ,COMMA that  reason  is  often  weak ,COMMA our  sentiments  are  strong ,COMMA and  our  sentiments  are  often  trustworthy .PERIOD and  this  work  corrects  that  bias  in  our  culture ,COMMA that  dehumanizing  bias .PERIOD it  gives  us  a  deeper  sense  of  what  it  actually  takes  for  us  to  thrive  in  this  life .PERIOD when  we  think  about  human  capital  we  think  about  the  things  we  can  measure  easily ,COMMA things  like  grades ,COMMA sat  's ,COMMA degrees ,COMMA the  number  of  years  in  schooling .PERIOD what  it  really  takes  to  do  well ,COMMA to  lead  a  meaningful  life ,COMMA are  things  that  are  deeper ,COMMA things  we  do  n't  really  even  have  words  for .PERIOD and  so  let  me  list  just  a  couple  of  the  things  i  think  this  research  points  us  toward  trying  to  understand .PERIOD the  first  gift ,COMMA or  talent ,COMMA is  mindsight ,COMMA the  ability  to  enter  into  other  people  's  minds  and  learn  what  they  have  to  offer .PERIOD babies  come  with  this  ability .PERIOD meltzoff ,COMMA who  's  at  the  university  of  washington ,COMMA leaned  over  a  baby  who  was  43  minutes  old .PERIOD he  wagged  his  tongue  at  the  baby .PERIOD the  baby  wagged  her  tongue  back .PERIOD babies  are  born  to  interpenetrate  into  mom  's  mind  and  to  download  what  they  find ,COMMA their  models  of  how  to  understand  reality .PERIOD in  the  united  states ,COMMA 55  percent  of  babies  have  a  deep  two-way  conversation  with  mom  and  they  learn  models  to  how  to  relate  to  other  people .PERIOD and  those  people  who  have  models  of  how  to  relate  have  a  huge  head  start  in  life .PERIOD scientists  at  the  university  of  minnesota  did  a  study  in  which  they  could  predict  with  77  percent  accuracy ,COMMA at  age  18  months ,COMMA who  was  going  to  graduate  from  high  school ,COMMA based  on  who  had  good  attachment  with  mom .PERIOD twenty  percent  of  kids  do  not  have  those  relationships .PERIOD they  are  what  we  call  avoidantly  attached .PERIOD they  have  trouble  relating  to  other  people .PERIOD they  go  through  life  like  sailboats  tacking  into  the  wind ,COMMA wanting  to  get  close  to  people ,COMMA but  not  really  having  the  models  of  how  to  do  that .PERIOD and  so  this  is  one  skill  of  how  to  hoover  up  knowledge ,COMMA one  from  another .PERIOD a  second  skill  is  equal  poise .PERIOD the  ability  to  have  the  serenity  to  read  the  biases  and  failures  in  your  own  mind .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA we  are  overconfidence  machines .PERIOD ninety-five  percent  of  our  professors  report  that  they  are  above-average  teachers .PERIOD ninety-six  percent  of  college  students  say  they  have  above-average  social  skills .PERIOD time  magazine  asked  americans ,COMMA are  you  in  the  top  one  percent  of  earners ?QUESTIONMARK nineteen  percent  of  americans  are  in  the  top  one  percent  of  earners .PERIOD this  is  a  gender-linked  trait ,COMMA by  the  way .PERIOD men  drown  at  twice  the  rate  of  women .PERIOD because  men  think  they  can  swim  across  that  lake .PERIOD but  some  people  have  the  ability  and  awareness  of  their  own  biases ,COMMA their  own  overconfidence .PERIOD they  have  epistemological  modesty .PERIOD they  are  open-minded  in  the  face  of  ambiguity .PERIOD they  are  able  to  adjust  strength  of  the  conclusions  to  the  strength  of  their  evidence .PERIOD they  are  curious .PERIOD and  these  traits  are  often  unrelated  and  uncorrelated  with  iq .PERIOD the  third  trait  is  metis ,COMMA what  we  might  call  street  smarts ,COMMA it  's  a  greek  word .PERIOD it  's  a  sensitivity  to  the  physical  environment ,COMMA the  ability  to  pick  out  patterns  in  an  environment ,COMMA derive  a  gist .PERIOD one  of  my  colleagues  at  the  times  did  a  great  story  about  soldiers  in  iraq  who  could  look  down  a  street  and  detect  somehow  whether  there  was  an  ied ,COMMA a  landmine ,COMMA in  the  street .PERIOD they  could  n't  tell  you  how  they  did  it ,COMMA but  they  could  feel  cold ,COMMA they  felt  a  coldness ,COMMA and  they  were  more  often  right  than  wrong .PERIOD the  third  is  what  you  might  call  sympathy ,COMMA the  ability  to  work  within  groups .PERIOD and  that  comes  in  tremendously  handy ,COMMA because  groups  are  smarter  than  individuals .PERIOD and  face-to-face  groups  are  much  smarter  than  groups  that  communicate  electronically ,COMMA because  90  percent  of  our  communication  is  non-verbal .PERIOD and  the  effectiveness  of  a  group  is  not  determined  by  the  iq  of  the  group .PERIOD it  's  determined  by  how  well  they  communicate ,COMMA how  often  they  take  turns  in  conversation .PERIOD then  you  could  talk  about  a  trait  like  blending .PERIOD any  child  can  say ,COMMA i  'm  a  tiger ,COMMA pretend  to  be  a  tiger .PERIOD it  seems  so  elementary .PERIOD but  in  fact ,COMMA it  's  phenomenally  complicated  to  take  a  concept  i  and  a  concept  tiger  and  blend  them  together .PERIOD but  this  is  the  source  of  innovation .PERIOD what  picasso  did ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA was  take  the  concept  western  art  and  the  concept  african  masks  and  blend  them  together ,COMMA not  only  the  geometry ,COMMA but  the  moral  systems  entailed  in  them .PERIOD and  these  are  skills ,COMMA again ,COMMA we  cannot  count  and  measure .PERIOD and  then  the  final  thing  i  'll  mention  is  something  you  might  call  limerence .PERIOD and  this  is  not  an  ability .PERIOD it  's  a  drive  and  a  motivation .PERIOD the  conscious  mind  hungers  for  success  and  prestige .PERIOD the  unconscious  mind  hungers  for  those  moments  of  transcendence ,COMMA when  the  skull  line  disappears  and  we  are  lost  in  a  challenge  or  a  task ,COMMA when  a  craftsman  feels  lost  in  his  craft ,COMMA when  a  naturalist  feels  at  one  with  nature ,COMMA when  a  believer  feels  at  one  with  god  's  love .PERIOD that  is  what  the  unconscious  mind  hungers  for .PERIOD and  many  of  us  feel  it  in  love  when  lovers  feel  fused .PERIOD and  one  of  the  most  beautiful  descriptions  i've  come  across  in  this  research  of  how  minds  interpenetrate  was  written  by  a  great  theorist  and  scientist  named  douglas  hofstadter  at  the  university  of  indiana .PERIOD he  was  married  to  a  woman  named  carol ,COMMA and  they  had  a  wonderful  relationship .PERIOD when  their  kids  were  five  and  two ,COMMA carol  had  a  stroke  and  a  brain  tumor  and  died  suddenly .PERIOD and  hofstadter  wrote  a  book  called  i  am  a  strange  loop .PERIOD in  the  course  of  that  book ,COMMA he  describes  a  moment ,COMMA just  months  after  carol  has  died ,COMMA he  comes  across  her  picture  on  the  mantel ,COMMA or  on  a  bureau  in  his  bedroom .PERIOD and  here  's  what  he  wrote ,COMMA i  looked  at  her  face ,COMMA and  i  looked  so  deeply  that  i  felt  i  was  behind  her  eyes .PERIOD and  all  at  once  i  found  myself  saying  as  tears  flowed ,COMMA that  's  me .PERIOD that  's  me' .PERIOD and  those  simple  words  brought  back  many  thoughts  that  i  had  had  before ,COMMA about  the  fusion  of  our  souls  into  one  higher-level  entity ,COMMA about  the  fact  that  at  the  core  of  both  our  souls  lay  our  identical  hopes  and  dreams  for  our  children ,COMMA about  the  notion  that  those  hopes  were  not  separate  or  distinct  hopes ,COMMA but  were  just  one  hope ,COMMA one  clear  thing  that  defined  us  both ,COMMA that  welded  us  into  a  unit ,COMMA the  kind  of  unit  i  had  but  dimly  imagined  before  being  married  and  having  children .PERIOD i  realized  that ,COMMA though  carol  had  died ,COMMA that  core  piece  of  her  had  not  died  at  all ,COMMA but  had  lived  on  very  determinedly  in  my  brain .PERIOD the  greeks  say  we  suffer  our  way  to  wisdom .PERIOD through  his  suffering ,COMMA hofstadter  understood  how  deeply  interpenetrated  we  are .PERIOD through  the  policy  failures  of  the  last  30  years ,COMMA we  have  come  to  acknowledge ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA how  shallow  our  view  of  human  nature  has  been .PERIOD and  now  as  we  confront  that  shallowness  and  the  failures  that  derive  from  our  inability  to  get  the  depths  of  who  we  are ,COMMA comes  this  revolution  in  consciousness ,COMMA these  people  in  so  many  fields  exploring  the  depth  of  our  nature  and  coming  away  with  this  enchanted ,COMMA this  new  humanism .PERIOD and  when  freud  discovered  his  sense  of  the  unconscious ,COMMA it  had  a  vast  effect  on  the  climate  of  the  times .PERIOD now  we  are  discovering  a  more  accurate  vision  of  the  unconscious ,COMMA of  who  we  are  deep  inside .PERIOD and  it  's  going  to  have  a  wonderful  and  profound  and  humanizing  effect  on  our  culture .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD both  myself  and  my  brother  belong  to  the  under  30  demographic ,COMMA which  pat  said  makes  70  percent ,COMMA but  according  to  our  statistics  it  makes  60  percent  of  the  region  's  population .PERIOD qatar  is  no  exception  to  the  region .PERIOD it  's  a  very  young  nation  led  by  young  people .PERIOD we  have  been  reminiscing  about  the  latest  technologies  and  the  ipods ,COMMA and  for  me  the  abaya ,COMMA my  traditional  dress  that  i  'm  wearing  today .PERIOD now  this  is  not  a  religious  garment ,COMMA nor  is  it  a  religious  statement .PERIOD instead ,COMMA it  's  a  diverse  cultural  statement  that  we  choose  to  wear .PERIOD now  i  remember  a  few  years  ago ,COMMA a  journalist  asked  dr.  sheikha ,COMMA who  's  sitting  here ,COMMA president  of  qatar  university ,COMMA who ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA is  a  woman ,COMMA he  asked  her  whether  she  thought  the  abaya  hindered  or  infringed  her  freedom  in  any  way .PERIOD her  answer  was  quite  the  contrary .PERIOD instead ,COMMA she  felt  more  free ,COMMA more  free  because  she  could  wear  whatever  she  wanted

a  choice ,COMMA just  like  the  indian  lady  could  wear  her  sari  or  the  japanese  woman  could  wear  her  kimono .PERIOD we  are  changing  our  culture  from  within ,COMMA but  at  the

are  wanting  to  be  different .PERIOD and  for  us  young  people ,COMMA they  're  looking  to  become  individuals  and  find  their  differences  amongst  themselves .PERIOD which  is  why  i  prefer  the  richard  wilk  analogy  of  globalizing  the  local  and  localizing  the  global .PERIOD we  do  n't  want  to  be  all  the  same ,COMMA but  we  want  to  respect  each  other  and

developments ,COMMA but  i  also  understand  that  this  has  to  be  done  organically .PERIOD yes ,COMMA we  do  have  all  the  resources  that  we  need  in  order  to  develop  new  cultural  institutions ,COMMA but  what  i  think  is  more  important  is  that  we  are  very  fortunate  to  have  visionary  leaders  who  understand  that  this  cannot  happen  from  outside ,COMMA it  has  to  come  from  within .PERIOD and  guess  what ?QUESTIONMARK you  might  be  surprised  to  know  that  most  people  in  the  gulf  who  are  leading  these  cultural  initiatives  happen  to  be  women .PERIOD i  want  to  ask  you ,COMMA why  do  you  think  this  is ?QUESTIONMARK is  it  because  it  's  a  soft  option .PERIOD we  have  nothing  else  to  do ?QUESTIONMARK no ,COMMA i  do  n't  think  so .PERIOD i  think  that  women  in  this  part  of  the  world  realize  that  culture  is  an  important  component  to  connect  people  both  locally  and  regionally .PERIOD it  's  a  natural  component  for  bringing  people  together ,COMMA discussing  ideas ,COMMA in  the  same  way  we  're  doing  here  at  ted .PERIOD we  're  here ,COMMA we  're  part  of  a

.PERIOD some  of  you  might  have  heard  of  the  algerian  artist  baya  mahieddine ,COMMA but  i  doubt  a  lot  of  people  know  that  this  artist  worked  in  picasso  's  studio  in  paris  in  the  1930s .PERIOD for  me  it  was  a  new  discovery .PERIOD and  i  think  with  time ,COMMA in  the  years  to  come  we  'll  be  learning  a  lot  about  our  picassos ,COMMA our  legers  and  our  cezannes .PERIOD we  do  have  artists ,COMMA but  unfortunately  we  have  not  discovered  them  yet .PERIOD now  visual  expression  is  just  one  form  of  culture  integration .PERIOD we  have  realized  that  recently  more  and  more  people  are  using  the  means  of  youtube  and  social  networking  to  express  their  stories ,COMMA share  their  photos  and  tell  their  own  stories  through  their  own  voices .PERIOD in  a  similar  way ,COMMA we  have  created  the  doha  film  institute .PERIOD now  the  doha  film  institute  is  an  organization  to  teach

,COMMA sustainability ,COMMA small  planet .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK picture  a  little  earth ,COMMA circling  around  the  sun .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA about  a  million  years  ago ,COMMA a  bunch  of  monkeys  fell  out  of  trees ,COMMA got  a  little  clever ,COMMA harnessed  fire ,COMMA invented  the  printing  press ,COMMA made ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA luggage  with  wheels  on  it .PERIOD and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA built  the  society  that  we  now  live  in .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA while  this  society  is ,COMMA without  a  doubt ,COMMA the  most  prosperous  and  dynamic  the  world  has  ever  created ,COMMA it  's  got  some  major ,COMMA major  flaws .PERIOD one  of  them  is  that  every  society  has  an  ecological  footprint .PERIOD it  has  an  amount  of  impact  on  the  planet  that  's  measurable .PERIOD how  much  stuff  goes  through  your  life ,COMMA how  much  waste  is  left  behind  you .PERIOD and  we ,COMMA at  the  moment ,COMMA in  our  society ,COMMA have  a  really  dramatically  unsustainable  level  of  this .PERIOD we  're  using  up  about  five  planets .PERIOD if  everybody  on  the  planet  lived  the  way  we  did ,COMMA we'd  need  between  five ,COMMA six ,COMMA seven ,COMMA some  people  even  say  10  planets  to  make  it .PERIOD clearly  we  do  n't  have  10  planets .PERIOD again ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA mental ,COMMA visual ,COMMA 10  planets ,COMMA one  planet ,COMMA 10  planets ,COMMA one  planet .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK we  do  n't  have  that .PERIOD so  that  's  one  problem .PERIOD the  second  problem  is  that  the  planet  that  we  have  is  being  used  in  wildly  unfair  ways .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK north  americans ,COMMA such  as  myself ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA we  're  basically  sort  of  wallowing ,COMMA gluttonous  hogs ,COMMA and  we  're  eating  all  sorts  of  stuff .PERIOD and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA then  you  get  all  the  way  down  to  people  who  live  in  the  asia-pacific  region ,COMMA or  even  more ,COMMA africa .PERIOD and  people  simply  do  not  have  enough  to  survive .PERIOD this  is  producing  all  sorts  of  tensions ,COMMA all  sorts  of  dynamics  that  are  deeply  disturbing .PERIOD and  there  's  more  and  more  people  on  the  way .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA this  is  what  the  planet  's  going  to  look  like  in  20  years .PERIOD it  's  going  to  be  a  pretty  crowded  place ,COMMA at  least  eight  billion  people .PERIOD so  to  make  matters  even  more  difficult ,COMMA it  's  a  very  young  planet .PERIOD a  third  of  the  people  on  this  planet  are  kids .PERIOD and  those  kids  are  growing  up  in  a  completely  different  way  than  their  parents  did ,COMMA no  matter  where  they  live .PERIOD they've  been  exposed  to  this  idea  of  our  society ,COMMA of  our  prosperity .PERIOD and  they  may  not  want  to  live  exactly  like  us .PERIOD they  may  not  want  to  be  americans ,COMMA or  brits ,COMMA or  germans ,COMMA or  south  africans ,COMMA but  they  want  their  own  version  of  a  life  which  is  more  prosperous ,COMMA and  more  dynamic ,COMMA and  more ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA enjoyable .PERIOD and  all  of  these  things  combine  to  create  an  enormous  amount  of  torque  on  the  planet .PERIOD and  if  we  cannot  figure  out  a  way  to  deal  with  that  torque ,COMMA we  are  going  to  find  ourselves  more  and  more  and  more  quickly  facing  situations  which  are  simply  unthinkable .PERIOD everybody  in  this  room  has  heard  the  worst-case  scenarios .PERIOD i  do  n't  need  to  go  into  that .PERIOD but  i  will  ask  the  question ,COMMA what  's  the  alternative ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  would  say  that ,COMMA at  the  moment ,COMMA the  alternative  is  unimaginable .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA so  on  the  one  hand  we  have  the  unthinkable .PERIOD on  the  other  hand  we  have  the  unimaginable .PERIOD we  do  n't  know  yet  how  to  build  a  society  which  is  environmentally  sustainable ,COMMA which  is  shareable  with  everybody  on  the  planet ,COMMA which  promotes  stability  and  democracy  and  human  rights ,COMMA and  which  is  achievable  in  the  time-frame  necessary  to  make  it  through  the  challenges  we  face .PERIOD we  do  n't  know  how  to  do  this  yet .PERIOD so  what  's  worldchanging ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA worldchanging  you  might  think  of  as  being  a  bit  of  a  news  service  for  the  unimaginable  future .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA what  we  're  out  there  doing  is  looking  for  examples  of  tools ,COMMA models  and  ideas ,COMMA which ,COMMA if  widely  adopted ,COMMA would  change  the  game .PERIOD a  lot  of  times ,COMMA when  i  do  a  talk  like  this ,COMMA i  talk  about  things  that  everybody  in  this  room  i  'm  sure  has  already  heard  of ,COMMA but  most  people  have  n't .PERIOD so  i  thought  today  i'd  do  something  a  little  different ,COMMA and  talk  about  what  we  're  looking  for ,COMMA rather  than  saying ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA rather  than  giving  you  tried-and-true  examples .PERIOD talk  about  the  kinds  of  things  we  're  scoping  out .PERIOD give  you  a  little  peek  into  our  editorial  notebook .PERIOD and  given  that  i  have  13  minutes  to  do  this ,COMMA this  is  going  to  go  kind  of  quick .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  do  n't  know ,COMMA just  stick  with  me .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA first  of  all ,COMMA what  are  we  looking  for ?QUESTIONMARK bright  green  city .PERIOD one  of  the  biggest  levers  that  we  have  in  the  developed  world  for  changing  the  impact  that  we  have  on  the  planet  is  changing  the  way  that  we  live  in  cities .PERIOD we  're  already  an  urban  planet .PERIOD that  's  especially  true  in  the  developed  world .PERIOD and  people  who  live  in  cities  in  the  developed  world  tend  to  be  very  prosperous ,COMMA and  thus  use  a  lot  of  stuff .PERIOD if  we  can  change  the  dynamic ,COMMA by  first  of  all  creating  cities  that  are  denser  and  more  livable .PERIOD here ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA is  vancouver ,COMMA which  if  you  have  n't  been  there ,COMMA you  ought  to  go  for  a  visit .PERIOD it  's  a  fabulous  city .PERIOD and  they  are  doing  density ,COMMA new  density ,COMMA better  than  probably  anybody  else  on  the  planet  right  now .PERIOD they  're  actually  managing  to  talk  north  americans  out  of  driving  cars ,COMMA which  is  a  pretty  great  thing .PERIOD so  you  have  density .PERIOD you  also  have  growth  management .PERIOD you  leave  aside  what  is  natural  to  be  natural .PERIOD this  is  in  portland .PERIOD that  is  an  actual  development .PERIOD that  land  there  will  remain  pasture  in  perpetuity .PERIOD they've  bounded  the  city  with  a  line .PERIOD nature ,COMMA city .PERIOD nothing  changes .PERIOD once  you  do  those  things ,COMMA you  can  start  making  all  sorts  of  investments .PERIOD you  can  start  doing  things  like ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA transit  systems  that  actually  work  to  transport  people ,COMMA in  effective  and  reasonably  comfortable  manners .PERIOD you  can  also  start  to  change  what  you  build .PERIOD this  is  the  beddington  zero  energy  development  in  london ,COMMA which  is  one  of  the  greenest  buildings  in  the  world .PERIOD it  's  a  fabulous  place .PERIOD we  're  able  to  now  build  buildings  that  generate  all  their  own  electricity ,COMMA that  recycle  much  of  their  water ,COMMA that  are  much  more  comfortable  than  standard  buildings ,COMMA use  all-natural  light ,COMMA etc ,COMMA and ,COMMA over  time ,COMMA cost  less .PERIOD green  roofs .PERIOD bill  mcdonough  covered  that  last  night ,COMMA so  i  wo  n't  dwell  on  that  too  much .PERIOD but  once  you  also  have  people  living  in  close  proximity  to  each  other ,COMMA one  of  the  things  you  can  do  is ,COMMA as  information  technologies  develop ,COMMA you  can  start  to  have  smart  places .PERIOD you  can  start  to  know  where  things  are .PERIOD when  you  know  where  things  are ,COMMA it  becomes  easier  to  share  them .PERIOD when  you  share  them ,COMMA you  end  up  using  less .PERIOD so  one  great  example  is  car-share  clubs ,COMMA which  are  really  starting  to  take  off  in  the  us ,COMMA have  already  taken  off  in  many  places  in  europe ,COMMA and  are  a  great  example .PERIOD if  you  're  somebody  who  drives ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA one  day  a  week ,COMMA do  you  really  need  your  own  car ?QUESTIONMARK another  thing  that  information  technology  lets  us  do  is  start  figuring  out  how  to  use  less  stuff  by  knowing ,COMMA and  by  monitoring ,COMMA the  amount  we  're  actually  using .PERIOD so ,COMMA here  's  a  power  cord  which  glows  brighter  the  more  energy  that  you  use ,COMMA which  i  think  is  a  pretty  cool  concept ,COMMA although  i  think  it  ought  to  work  the  other  way  around ,COMMA that  it  gets  brighter  the  more  you  do  n't  use .PERIOD but ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA there  may  even  be  a  simpler  approach .PERIOD we  could  just  re-label  things .PERIOD this  light  switch  that  reads ,COMMA on  the  one  hand ,COMMA flashfloods ,COMMA and  on  the  other  hand ,COMMA off .PERIOD how  we  build  things  can  change  as  well .PERIOD this  is  a  bio-morphic  building .PERIOD it  takes  its  inspiration  in  form  from  life .PERIOD many  of  these  buildings  are  incredibly  beautiful ,COMMA and  also  much  more  effective .PERIOD this  is  an  example  of  bio-mimicry ,COMMA which  is  something  we  're  really  starting  to  look  a  lot  more  for .PERIOD in  this  case ,COMMA you  have  a  shell  design  which  was  used  to  create  a  new  kind  of  exhaust  fan ,COMMA which  is  greatly  more  effective .PERIOD there  's  a  lot  of  this  stuff  happening .PERIOD it  's  really  pretty  remarkable .PERIOD i  encourage  you  to  look  on  worldchanging  if  you  're  into  it .PERIOD we  're  starting  to  cover  this  more  and  more .PERIOD there  's  also  neo-biological  design ,COMMA where  more  and  more  we  're  actually  using  life  itself  and  the  processes  of  life  to  become  part  of  our  industry .PERIOD so  this ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA is  hydrogen-generating  algae .PERIOD so  we  have  a  model  in  potential ,COMMA an  emerging  model  that  we  're  looking  for  of  how  to  take  the  cities  most  of  us  live  in ,COMMA and  turn  them  into  bright  green  cities .PERIOD but  unfortunately ,COMMA most  of  the  people  on  the  planet  do  n't  live  in  the  cites  we  live  in .PERIOD they  live  in  the  emerging  megacities  of  the  developing  world .PERIOD and  there  's  a  statistic  i  often  like  to  use ,COMMA which  is  that  we  're  adding  a  city  of  seattle  every  four  days ,COMMA a  city  the  size  of  seattle  to  the  planet  every  four  days .PERIOD i  was  giving  a  talk  about  two  months  ago ,COMMA and  this  guy ,COMMA who'd  done  some  work  with  the  un ,COMMA came  up  to  me  and  was  really  flustered ,COMMA and  he  said ,COMMA look ,COMMA you've  got  that  totally  wrong .PERIOD it  's  totally  wrong .PERIOD it  's  every  seven  days .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  're  adding  a  city  the  size  of  seattle  every  seven  days ,COMMA and  most  of  those  cities  look  more  like  this  than  the  city  that  you  or  i  live  in .PERIOD most  of  those  cites  are  growing  incredibly  quickly .PERIOD they  do  n't  have  existing  infrastructure .PERIOD they  have  enormous  numbers  of  people  who  are  struggling  with  poverty ,COMMA and  enormous  numbers  of  people  are  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  do  things  in  new  ways .PERIOD so  what  do  we  need  in  order  to  make  developing  nation  megacities  into  bright  green  megacities ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  first  thing  we  need  is ,COMMA we  need  leapfrogging .PERIOD and  this  is  one  of  the  things  that  we  are  looking  for  everywhere .PERIOD the  idea  behind  leapfrogging  is  that  if  you  are  a  person ,COMMA or  a  country ,COMMA who  is  stuck  in  a  situation  where  you  do  n't  have  the  tools  and  technologies  that  you  need ,COMMA there  's  no  reason  for  you  to  invest  in  last  generation  's  technologies .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK that  you  're  much  better  off ,COMMA almost  universally ,COMMA looking  for  a  low-cost  or  locally  applicable  version  of  the  newest  technology .PERIOD one  place  we  're  all  familiar  with  seeing  this  is  with  cell  phones .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK all  throughout  the  developing  world ,COMMA people  are  going  directly  to  cell  phones ,COMMA skipping  the  whole  landline  stage .PERIOD if  there  are  landlines  in  many  developing  world  cities ,COMMA they  're  usually  pretty  crappy  systems  that  break  down  a  lot  and  cost  enormous  amounts  of  money .PERIOD so  i  rather  like  this  picture  here .PERIOD i  particularly  like  the  ganesh  in  the  background ,COMMA talking  on  the  cell  phone .PERIOD so  what  we  have ,COMMA increasingly ,COMMA is  cell  phones  just  permeating  out  through  society .PERIOD we've  heard  all  about  this  here  this  week ,COMMA so  i  wo  n't  say  too  much  more  than  that ,COMMA other  than  to  say  what  is  true  for  cell  phones  is  true  for  all  sorts  of  technologies .PERIOD the  second  thing  is  tools  for  collaboration ,COMMA be  they  systems  of  collaboration ,COMMA or  intellectual  property  systems  which  encourage  collaboration .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK when  you  have  free  ability  for  people  to  freely  work  together  and  innovate ,COMMA you  get  different  kinds  of  solutions .PERIOD and  those  solutions  are  accessible  in  a  different  way  to  people  who  do  n't  have  capital .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA we  have  open  source  software ,COMMA we  have  creative  commons  and  other  kinds  of  copyleft  solutions .PERIOD and  those  things  lead  to  things  like  this .PERIOD this  is  a  telecentro  in  sao  paulo .PERIOD this  is  a  pretty  remarkable  program  using  free  and  open  source  software ,COMMA cheap ,COMMA sort  of  hacked-together  machines ,COMMA and  basically  sort  of  abandoned  buildings ,COMMA has  put  together  a  bunch  of  community  centers  where  people  can  come  in ,COMMA get  high-speed  internet  access ,COMMA learn  computer  programming  skills  for  free .PERIOD and  a  quarter-million  people  every  year  use  these  now  in  sao  paulo .PERIOD and  those  quarter-million  people  are  some  of  the  poorest  people  in  sao  paolo .PERIOD i  particularly  like  the  little  linux  penguin  in  the  back .PERIOD so  one  of  the  things  that  that  's  leading  to  is  a  sort  of  southern  cultural  explosion .PERIOD and  one  of  the  things  we  're  really ,COMMA really  interested  in  at  worldchanging  is  the  ways  in  which  the  south  is  re-identifying  itself ,COMMA and  re-categorizing  itself  in  ways  that  have  less  and  less  to  do  with  most  of  us  in  this  room .PERIOD so  it  's  not ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA bollywood  is  n't  just  answering  hollywood .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ,COMMA brazilian  music  scene  is  n't  just  answering  the  major  labels .PERIOD it  's  doing  something  new .PERIOD there  's  new  things  happening .PERIOD there  's  interplay  between  them .PERIOD and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  get  amazing  things .PERIOD like ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  if  any  of  you  have  seen  the  movie  city  of  god ?QUESTIONMARK yeah ,COMMA it  's  a  fabulous  movie  if  you  have  n't  seen  it .PERIOD and  it  's  all  about  this  question ,COMMA in  a  very  artistic  and  indirect  kind  of  way .PERIOD you  have  other  radical  examples  where  the  ability  to  use  cultural  tools  is  spreading  out .PERIOD these  are  people  who  have  just  been  visited  by  the  internet  bookmobile  in  uganda .PERIOD and  who  are  waving  their  first  books  in  the  air ,COMMA which ,COMMA i  just  think  that  's  a  pretty  cool  picture .PERIOD you  know ?QUESTIONMARK so  you  also  have  the  ability  for  people  to  start  coming  together  and  acting  on  their  own  behalf  in  political  and  civic  ways .PERIOD in  ways  that  have  n't  happened  before .PERIOD and  as  we  heard  last  night ,COMMA as  we've  heard  earlier  this  week ,COMMA are  absolutely ,COMMA fundamentally  vital  to  the  ability  to  craft  new  solutions ,COMMA is  we've  got  to  craft  new  political  realities .PERIOD and  i  would  personally  say  that  we  have  to  craft  new  political  realities ,COMMA not  only  in  places  like  india ,COMMA afghanistan ,COMMA kenya ,COMMA pakistan ,COMMA what  have  you ,COMMA but  here  at  home  as  well .PERIOD another  world  is  possible .PERIOD and  sort  of  the  big  motto  of  the  anti-globalization  movement .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK we  tweak  that  a  lot .PERIOD we  talk  about  how  another  world  is  n't  just  possible .PERIOD another  world  's  here .PERIOD that  it  's  not  just  that  we  have  to  sort  of  imagine  there  being  a  different ,COMMA vague  possibility  out  there ,COMMA but  we  need  to  start  acting  a  little  bit  more  on  that  possibility .PERIOD we  need  to  start  doing  things  like  lula ,COMMA president  of  brazil .PERIOD how  many  people  knew  of  lula  before  today ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA so ,COMMA much ,COMMA much  better  than  the  average  crowd ,COMMA i  can  tell  you  that .PERIOD so  lula ,COMMA he  's  full  of  problems ,COMMA full  of  contradictions ,COMMA but  one  of  the  things  that  he  's  doing  is ,COMMA he  is  putting  forward  an  idea  of  how  we  engage  in  international  relations  that  completely  shifts  the  balance  from  the  standard  sort  of  north-south  dialogue  into  a  whole  new  way  of  global  collaboration .PERIOD i  would  keep  your  eye  on  this  fellow .PERIOD another  example  of  this  sort  of  second  superpower  thing  is  the  rise  of  these  games  that  are  what  we  call  serious  play .PERIOD we  're  looking  a  lot  at  this .PERIOD this  is  spreading  everywhere .PERIOD this  is  from  a  force  more  powerful  it  's  a  little  screenshot .PERIOD a  force  more  powerful  is  a  video  game  that ,COMMA while  you  're  playing  it ,COMMA it  teaches  you  how  to  engage  in  non-violent  insurrection  and  regime  change .PERIOD here  's  another  one .PERIOD this  is  from  a  game  called  food  force ,COMMA which  is  a  game  that  teaches  children  how  to  run  a  refugee  camp .PERIOD these  things  are  all  contributing  in  a  very  dynamic  way  to  a  huge  rise  in ,COMMA especially  in  the  developing  world ,COMMA in  people  's  interest  in  and  passion  for  democracy .PERIOD we  get  so  little  news  about  the  developing  world  that  we  often  forget  that  there  are  literally  millions  of  people  out  there  struggling  to  change  things  to  be  fairer ,COMMA freer ,COMMA more  democratic ,COMMA less  corrupt .PERIOD and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA we  do  n't  hear  those  stories  enough .PERIOD but  it  's  happening  all  over  the  place ,COMMA and  these  tools  are  part  of  what  's  making  it  possible .PERIOD now  when  you  add  all  those  things  together ,COMMA when  you  add  together  leapfrogging  and  new  kinds  of  tools ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA second  superpower  stuff ,COMMA etc ,COMMA what  do  you  get ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA very  quickly ,COMMA you  get  a  bright  green  future  for  the  developing  world .PERIOD you  get ,COMMA

people  out  there ,COMMA for  whom  nightfall  means  darkness ,COMMA to  have  a  new  means  of  operating .PERIOD these  are  refrigerators  that  require  no  electricity .PERIOD they  're  pot  within  a  pot  design .PERIOD and  you  get  water  solutions .PERIOD water  's  one  of  the  most  pressing  problems .PERIOD here  's  a  design  for  harvesting  rainwater  that  's  super  cheap  and  available  to  people  in  the  developing  world .PERIOD here  's  a  design  for  distilling  water  using  sunlight .PERIOD here  's  a  fog-catcher ,COMMA which ,COMMA if  you  live  in  a  moist ,COMMA jungle-like  area ,COMMA will  distill  water  from  the  air  that  's  clean  and  drinkable .PERIOD here  's  a  way  of  transporting  water .PERIOD i  just  love  this ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA i  mean  carrying  water  is  such  a  drag ,COMMA and  somebody  just  came  up  with  the  idea  of  well ,COMMA what  if  you  rolled  it .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA that  's  a  great  design .PERIOD this  is  a  fabulous  invention ,COMMA lifestraw .PERIOD basically  you  can  suck  any  water  through  this  and  it  will  become  drinkable  by  the  time  it  hits  your  lips .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA people  who  are  in  desperate  straits  can  get  this .PERIOD this  is  one  of  my  favorite  worldchanging  kinds  of  things  ever .PERIOD this  is

great .PERIOD and  the  same  thing  is  true  for  people  who  are  in  absolute  crisis .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK we  're  expecting  to  have  upwards  of  200  million  refugees  by  the  year

,COMMA i  settled  down ,COMMA and  i  realize  it  sounds  like  a  bad  sitcom  or  a  cat  stevens  song  -- .PERIOD but  life  was  pretty  good .PERIOD life  was  pretty  good .PERIOD 2006  was

for  a  lot  of  people ,COMMA not  just  me .PERIOD first  of  all ,COMMA the  news  was  so  heavy .PERIOD it  's  still  heavy  now ,COMMA and  it  was  heavy  before  that ,COMMA but  when  you  flipped  open  a  newspaper ,COMMA when  you  turned  on  the  tv ,COMMA it  was  about  ice  caps  melting ,COMMA wars  going  on  around  the  world ,COMMA earthquakes ,COMMA hurricanes  and  an  economy  that  was  wobbling  on  the  brink  of  collapse ,COMMA and  then  eventually  did  collapse ,COMMA and  so  many  of  us  losing  our  homes ,COMMA or  our  jobs ,COMMA or  our  retirements

i  just  showed  you  a  picture  of ,COMMA had  been  battling  mental  illness  for  some  time .PERIOD and  for  those  of  you  whose  lives  have  been  touched  by  mental  illness ,COMMA you

were  circling  me ,COMMA and  i  was  finding  it  really ,COMMA really  difficult  to  think  of  anything  good ,COMMA i  said  to  myself  that  i  really  needed  a  way  to  focus  on  the  positive  somehow .PERIOD so  i  came  home  from  work  one  night ,COMMA and  i  logged  onto  the  computer ,COMMA and  i  started  up  a  tiny  website  called  1000awesomethingscom .PERIOD i  was  trying  to  remind  myself  of  the  simple ,COMMA universal ,COMMA little  pleasures  that  we  all  love ,COMMA but  we  just  do  n't  talk  about  enough ,COMMA things  like  waiters  and  waitresses  who  bring  you  free  refills  without  asking ,COMMA being  the  first  table  to  get  called  up  to  the  dinner  buffet  at  a  wedding ,COMMA wearing  warm  underwear  from  just

,COMMA swoop  right  in  there .PERIOD and  slowly  over  time ,COMMA i  started  putting  myself  in  a  better  mood .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA 50,000  blogs  are  started  a  day .PERIOD and  so  my  blog  was  just  one  of  those  50,000 .PERIOD and  nobody  read  it  except  for  my  mom .PERIOD although  i  should  say  that  my  traffic  did  skyrocket  and  go  up  by  100  percent  when  she  forwarded  it  to  my  dad .PERIOD and  then  i  got  excited  when  it  started  getting  tens  of  hits .PERIOD and  then  i  started  getting  excited  when  it  started  getting  dozens  and  then  hundreds  and  then  thousands  and  then  millions .PERIOD it  started  getting  bigger  and  bigger  and  bigger .PERIOD and  then  i  got  a  phone  call ,COMMA and  the  voice  at  the  other  end  of  the  line  said ,COMMA you've  just  won  the  best  blog  in  the  world  award .PERIOD i  was  like ,COMMA that  sounds  totally  fake .PERIOD which  african  country  do  you  want  me  to  wire  all  my  money  to ?QUESTIONMARK but  it  turns  out ,COMMA i  jumped  on  a  plane ,COMMA and  i  ended  up  walking  a  red  carpet  between  sarah  silverman  and  jimmy  fallon  and  martha  stewart .PERIOD and  i  went  onstage  to  accept  a  webby  award  for  best  blog .PERIOD and  the  surprise  and  just  the  amazement  of  that  was  only  overshadowed  by  my  return  to

wanted  to  tell  you  the  awesome  story ,COMMA i  wanted  to  share  with  you  the  three  as  of  awesome ,COMMA and  i  wanted  to  leave  you  with  a  closing  thought .PERIOD so  let  's  talk  about  those  three  as .PERIOD over  the  last  few  years ,COMMA i  have  n't  had  that  much  time  to  really  think .PERIOD but  lately  i  have  had  the  opportunity  to  take  a  step  back  and  ask  myself ,COMMA what  is  it  over  the  last  few  years  that  helped  me  grow  my  website ,COMMA but  also  grow  myself ?QUESTIONMARK and  i've  summarized  those  things ,COMMA for  me  personally ,COMMA as  three  as .PERIOD they  are  attitude ,COMMA awareness  and  authenticity .PERIOD i'd  love  to  just  talk  about  each  one  briefly .PERIOD so  attitude ,COMMA look ,COMMA we  're  all  going  to  get  lumps ,COMMA and  we  're  all  going  to  get  bumps .PERIOD none  of  us  can  predict  the  future ,COMMA but  we  do  know  one  thing  about  it  and  that  's  that  it  ai  n't  gonna  go  according  to  plan .PERIOD we  will  all  have  high  highs  and  big  days  and  proud  moments  of  smiles  on  graduation  stages ,COMMA father-daughter  dances  at  weddings  and  healthy  babies  screeching  in  the  delivery  room ,COMMA but  between  those  high  highs ,COMMA we  may  also  have  some  lumps  and  some  bumps  too .PERIOD it  's  sad ,COMMA and  it  's  not  pleasant  to  talk  about ,COMMA but  your  husband  might  leave  you ,COMMA your  girlfriend  could  cheat ,COMMA your  headaches  might  be  more  serious  than  you  thought ,COMMA or  your  dog  could  get  hit  by  a  car  on  the  street .PERIOD it  's  not  a  happy  thought ,COMMA but  your  kids  could  get  mixed  up  in  gangs  or  bad  scenes .PERIOD your  mom  could  get  cancer ,COMMA your  dad  could  get  mean .PERIOD and  there  are  times  in  life  when  you  will  be  tossed  in  the  well ,COMMA too ,COMMA with  twists  in  your  stomach  and  with  holes  in  your  heart .PERIOD and  when  that  bad  news  washes  over  you ,COMMA and  when  that  pain  sponges  and  soaks  in ,COMMA i  just  really  hope  you  feel  like  you've  always  got  two  choices .PERIOD one ,COMMA you  can  swirl  and  twirl  and  gloom  and  doom  forever ,COMMA or  two ,COMMA you  can  grieve  and  then  face  the  future  with  newly  sober  eyes .PERIOD having  a  great  attitude  is  about  choosing  option  number  two ,COMMA and  choosing ,COMMA no  matter  how  difficult  it  is ,COMMA no  matter  what  pain  hits  you ,COMMA choosing  to  move  forward  and  move  on  and  take  baby  steps  into  the  future .PERIOD the  second  a  is  awareness .PERIOD i  love  hanging  out  with  three  year-olds .PERIOD i  love  the  way  that  they  see  the  world ,COMMA because  they  're  seeing  the  world  for  the  first  time .PERIOD i  love  the  way  that  they  can  stare  at  a  bug  crossing  the  sidewalk .PERIOD i  love  the  way  that  they  'll  stare  slack-jawed  at  their  first  baseball  game  with  wide  eyes  and  a  mitt  on  their  hand ,COMMA soaking  in  the  crack  of  the  bat  and  the  crunch  of  the  peanuts  and  the  smell  of  the  hotdogs .PERIOD i  love  the  way  that  they  'll  spend  hours  picking  dandelions  in  the  backyard  and  putting  them  into  a  nice  centerpiece  for  thanksgiving  dinner .PERIOD i  love  the  way  that  they  see  the  world ,COMMA because  they  're  seeing  the  world  for  the  first  time .PERIOD having  a  sense  of  awareness  is  just  about  embracing  your  inner  three  year-old .PERIOD because  you  all  used  to  be  three  years  old .PERIOD that  three-year-old  boy  is  still  part  of  you .PERIOD that  three-year-old  girl  is  still  part  of  you .PERIOD they  're  in  there .PERIOD and  being  aware  is  just  about  remembering  that  you  saw  everything  you've  seen  for  the  first  time  once ,COMMA too .PERIOD so  there  was  a  time  when  it  was  your  first  time  ever  hitting  a  string  of  green  lights  on  the  way  home  from  work .PERIOD there  was  the  first  time  you  walked  by  the  open  door  of  a  bakery  and  smelt  the  bakery  air ,COMMA or  the  first  time  you  pulled  a  20-dollar  bill  out  of  your  old  jacket  pocket  and  said ,COMMA found  money .PERIOD the  last  a  is  authenticity .PERIOD and  for  this  one ,COMMA i  want  to  tell  you  a  quick  story .PERIOD when ,COMMA on  a  peanut  farm  in  georgia ,COMMA a  little  baby  boy  named  roosevelt  grier  was  born .PERIOD roosevelt  grier ,COMMA or  rosey  grier ,COMMA as  people  used  to  call  him ,COMMA grew  up  and  grew  into  a  300-pound ,COMMA six-foot-five  linebacker  in  the  nfl .PERIOD he  's  number  76  in  the  picture .PERIOD here  he  is  pictured  with  the  fearsome  foursome .PERIOD these  were  four  guys  on  the  la .PERIOD rams  in  the  1960s  you  did  not  want  to  go  up  against .PERIOD they  were  tough  football  players  doing  what  they  love ,COMMA which  was  crushing  skulls  and  separating  shoulders  on  the  football  field .PERIOD but  rosey  grier  also  had  another  passion .PERIOD in  his  deeply  authentic  self ,COMMA he  also  loved  needlepoint .PERIOD he  loved  knitting .PERIOD he  said  that  it  calmed  him  down ,COMMA it  relaxed  him ,COMMA it  took  away  his  fear  of  flying  and  helped  him  meet  chicks .PERIOD that  's  what  he  said .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA he  loved  it  so  much  that ,COMMA after  he  retired  from  the  nfl ,COMMA he  started  joining  clubs .PERIOD and  he  even  put  out  a  book  called  rosey  grier  's  needlepoint  for  men .PERIOD it  's  a  great  cover .PERIOD if  you  notice ,COMMA he  's  actually  needlepointing  his  own  face .PERIOD and  so  what  i  love  about  this  story  is  that  rosey  grier  is  just  such  an  authentic  person .PERIOD and  that  's  what  authenticity  is  all  about .PERIOD it  's  just  about  being  you  and  being  cool  with  that .PERIOD and  i  think  when  you  're  authentic ,COMMA you  end  up  following  your  heart ,COMMA and  you  put

date ,COMMA and  we'd  go  home .PERIOD and  we'd  actually  take  an  atlas  off  the  shelf ,COMMA and  we'd  flip  through  until  we  found  this  mysterious  country .PERIOD and  when  we  did ,COMMA my  dad  would  say ,COMMA can  you  believe  someone  climbed  a  tree  over  there ,COMMA picked  this  thing  off  it ,COMMA put  it  in  a  truck ,COMMA drove  it  all  the  way  to  the

big  solution .PERIOD this  solution  has  been  called ,COMMA by  some ,COMMA potentially  the  most  important  medical  advance  this  century .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  solution  turned  out  to  be  simple .PERIOD and  what  it  was  was  oral  rehydration  salts .PERIOD many  of  you  have  probably  used  this .PERIOD it  's  brilliant .PERIOD it  's  a  way  to  get  sodium  and  glucose  together  so  that  when  you  add  it  to  water  the  child  is  able  to  absorb  it  even  during  situations  of  diarrhea .PERIOD remarkable  impact  on  mortality .PERIOD massive  solution  to  the  problem .PERIOD flash  forward ,COMMA 1960 ,COMMA 24  percent  child  mortality  has  dropped  to  65  percent  today .PERIOD still  a  big  number ,COMMA but  a  big  drop .PERIOD it  looks

?QUESTIONMARK well  the  easy  answer  is ,COMMA we  just  have  n't  gotten  those  salts  to  those  people .PERIOD that  's  actually  not  true .PERIOD if  you  look  in  areas  where  these  salts  are  completely  available ,COMMA the  price  is  low  or  zero ,COMMA these  deaths  still  continue  abated .PERIOD maybe  there  's  a  biological  answer .PERIOD maybe  these  are  the  deaths  that  simple  rehydration  alone  does  n't  solve .PERIOD that  's  not  true  either .PERIOD many  of  these  deaths  were  completely  preventable .PERIOD and  this  what  i  want  to

an  income  problem ,COMMA so  we  create  new  ways  of  farming  that  increase  income .PERIOD well ,COMMA look  at  some  old  ways ,COMMA some  ways  that  we'd  already  cracked .PERIOD intercropping .PERIOD intercropping  really  increases  income .PERIOD sometimes  in  rice  we  found  incredible  increases  in  yield  when  you  mix  different  varieties  of  rice  side  by  side .PERIOD some  people  are  doing  that ,COMMA many  are  not .PERIOD what  's  going  on ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  the  last  mile .PERIOD the  last  mile  is ,COMMA everywhere ,COMMA problematic .PERIOD alright ,COMMA what  's  the  problem ?QUESTIONMARK the  problem  is  this  little  three-pound  machine  that  's  behind  your  eyes  and  between  your  ears .PERIOD this  machine  is  really  strange ,COMMA and  one  of  the  consequences  is  that  people  are  weird .PERIOD they  do  lots  of  inconsistent  things .PERIOD they  do  lots  of  inconsistent  things .PERIOD and  the  inconsistencies  create ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA this  last  mile  problem .PERIOD see ,COMMA when  we  were  dealing  with  our  biology ,COMMA bacteria ,COMMA the  genes ,COMMA the  things  inside  here ,COMMA the  blood ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  complex ,COMMA but  it  's  manageable .PERIOD when  we  're  dealing  with  people  like  this ?QUESTIONMARK the  mind  is  more  complex .PERIOD that  's  not  as  manageable ,COMMA and  that  's  what  we  're  struggling  with .PERIOD let  me  go  back  to  diarrhea  for  a  second .PERIOD here  's  a  question  that  was  asked  in  the  national  sample  survey ,COMMA which  is  a  survey  asked  of  many  indian  women: .PERIOD your  child  has  diarrhea .PERIOD should  you  increase ,COMMA maintain  or  decrease  the  number  of  fluids ?QUESTIONMARK just  so  you  do  n't  embarrass  yourselves ,COMMA i  'll  give  you  the  right  answer: .PERIOD it  's  increase .PERIOD now ,COMMA diarrhea  's  interesting  because  it  's  been  around  for  thousands  of  years ,COMMA ever  since  humankind  really  lived  side  by  side  enough  to  have  really  polluted  water .PERIOD one  roman  strategy  that  was  very  interesting  was  that ,COMMA and  it  really  gave  them  a  comparative  advantage ,COMMA they  made  sure  their  soldiers  did  n't  drink  even  remotely  muddied  waters .PERIOD because  if  some  of  your  troops  get  diarrhea  they  're  not  that  effective  on  the  battlefield .PERIOD so ,COMMA if  you  think  of  roman  comparative  advantage  part  of  it  was  the  breast  shields ,COMMA the  breastplates ,COMMA but  part  of  it  was  drinking  the  right  water .PERIOD so ,COMMA here  are  these  women .PERIOD they've  seen  their  parents  have  struggled  with  diarrhea ,COMMA they've  struggled  with  diarrhea .PERIOD they've  seen  lots  of  deaths .PERIOD how  do  they  answer  this  question ?QUESTIONMARK in  india ,COMMA 35  to  50  percent  say  reduce .PERIOD think  about  what  that  means  for  a  second .PERIOD thirty-five  to  50  percent  of  women  forget  oral  rehydration  therapy ,COMMA they  are  increasing ,COMMA they  are  actually  making  their  child  more  likely  to  die  through  their  actions .PERIOD how  is  that  possible ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA one  possibility ,COMMA i  think  that  's  how  most  people  respond  to  this ,COMMA is  to  say ,COMMA that  's  just  stupid .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  that  's  stupid .PERIOD i  think  there  is  something  very  profoundly  right  in  what  these  women  are  doing .PERIOD and  that  is ,COMMA you  do  n't  put  water  into  a  leaky  bucket .PERIOD so ,COMMA think  of  the  mental  model  that  goes  behind  reducing  the  intake .PERIOD just  does  n't  make  sense .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  model  is  intuitively  right .PERIOD it  just  does  n't  happen  to  be  right  about  the  world .PERIOD but  it  makes  a  whole  lot  of  sense  at  some  deep  level .PERIOD and  that ,COMMA to  me ,COMMA is  the  fundamental  challenge  of  the  last  mile .PERIOD this  first  challenge  is  what  i  refer  to  as  the  persuasion  challenge .PERIOD convincing  people  to  do  something ,COMMA take  oral  rehydration  therapy ,COMMA intercrop ,COMMA whatever  it  might  be ,COMMA is  not  an  act  of  information: .PERIOD let  's  give  them  the  data ,COMMA and  when  they  have  data  they  'll  do  the  right  thing .PERIOD it  's  more  complex  than  that .PERIOD and  if  you  want  to  understand  how  it  's  more  complex  let  me  start  with  something  kind  of  interesting .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  give  you  a  little  math  problem .PERIOD and  i  want  you  to  just  yell  out  the  answer  as  fast  as  possible .PERIOD a  bat  and  a  ball  together  cost  $110 .PERIOD the  bat  costs  a  dollar  more  than  the  ball .PERIOD how  much  does  the  ball  cost ?QUESTIONMARK quick .PERIOD so ,COMMA somebody  out  there  says ,COMMA five .PERIOD a  lot  of  you  said ,COMMA ten .PERIOD let  's  think  about  10  for  a  second .PERIOD if  the  ball  costs  10 ,COMMA the  bat  costs .PERIOD this  is  easy ,COMMA $110 .PERIOD yeah .PERIOD so ,COMMA together  they  would  cost  $120 .PERIOD so ,COMMA here  you  all  are ,COMMA ostensibly  educated  people .PERIOD most  of  you  look  smart .PERIOD the  combination  of  that  produces  something  that  is  actually ,COMMA you  got  this  thing  wrong .PERIOD how  is  that  possible ?QUESTIONMARK let  's  go  to  something  else .PERIOD i  know  algebra  can  be  complicated .PERIOD so ,COMMA let  's  dial  this  back .PERIOD that  's  what ?QUESTIONMARK fifth  grade ?QUESTIONMARK fourth  grade ?QUESTIONMARK let  's  go  back  to  kindergarten .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK there  's  a  great  show  on  american  television  that  you  have  to  watch .PERIOD it  's  called  are  you  smarter  than  a  fifth  grader ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  we've  learned  the  answer  to  that  here .PERIOD let  's  move  to  kindergarten .PERIOD let  's  see  if  we  can  beat  five-year-olds .PERIOD here  's  what  i  'm  going  to  do ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  put

.PERIOD almost  out  of  kindergarten .PERIOD what  is  all  this  telling  us ?QUESTIONMARK you  see ,COMMA what  's  going  on  here ,COMMA and  in  the  bat  and  ball  problem  is  that  you  have

matter  is ,COMMA you  look  at  that  car ,COMMA it  does  n't  look  like  a  volvo .PERIOD and  it  does  n't  look  like  a  hummer .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  i  want  you  to  think  about  for  a  few  minutes  is ,COMMA how  would  you  convey  safety  of  the  bmw ?QUESTIONMARK okay ?QUESTIONMARK so  now ,COMMA while  you  're  thinking  about  that  let  's  move  to  a  second  task .PERIOD the  second  task  is  fuel  efficiency .PERIOD okay ?QUESTIONMARK here  's  another  puzzle  for  all  of  you .PERIOD one  person  walks  into  a  car  lot ,COMMA and  they  're  thinking  about

,COMMA another  person  walks  into  the  lot .PERIOD and  they  're  about  to  buy  a  hummer ,COMMA nine  miles  per  gallon ,COMMA fully  loaded ,COMMA luxury .PERIOD and  they  say ,COMMA you

off  some  of  that  weight ,COMMA and  i  'm  going  to  buy  a  hummer  that  's  11  miles  per  gallon  which  one  of  these  people  has  done  more  for  the  environment ?QUESTIONMARK see ,COMMA you  have  a  mental  model .PERIOD fifty  versus  35 ,COMMA that  's  a  big  move .PERIOD eleven  versus  nine ?QUESTIONMARK come  on .PERIOD turns  out ,COMMA go  home  and  do  the  math ,COMMA the  nine  to  11  is  a  bigger  change .PERIOD that  person  has  saved  more  gallons .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK because  we  do  n't  care  about  miles  per  gallon ,COMMA we  care  about  gallons  per  mile .PERIOD think  about  how  powerful  that  is  if  you  're  trying  to  encourage  fuel  efficiency .PERIOD miles  per  gallon  is  the  way  we  present  things .PERIOD if  we

bmw .PERIOD what  should  they  do ?QUESTIONMARK the  problem  bmw  faces  is  this  car  looks  safe .PERIOD this  car ,COMMA which  is  my  mini ,COMMA does  n't  look  that  safe .PERIOD here  was  bmw  's  brilliant  insight ,COMMA which  they  embodied  into  an  ad  campaign .PERIOD they  showed  a  bmw  driving  down  the  street .PERIOD there  's  a  truck  on  the  right .PERIOD boxes

but  notice  the  power  of  it .PERIOD it  harnesses  something  you  already  believe .PERIOD now ,COMMA even  if  i  persuaded  you  to  do  something ,COMMA it  's  hard  sometimes  to  actually  get  action  as  a  result .PERIOD you  all  probably  intended  to  wake  up ,COMMA i  do  n't  know ,COMMA 6:30 ,COMMA 7  am .PERIOD this  is  a  battle  we  all  fight  every  day ,COMMA along  with  trying  to  get  to  the  gym .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  is  an  example  of  that  battle ,COMMA and  makes  us  realize  intentions  do  n't  always  translate  into  action ,COMMA and  so  one  of  the  fundamental  challenges  is  how  we  would  actually  do  that .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA let  me  now  talk  about  the  last  mile  problem .PERIOD so  far ,COMMA i've  been  pretty  negative .PERIOD i've  been  trying  to  show  you  the  oddities  of  human  behavior .PERIOD and  i  think  maybe  i  'm  being  too  negative .PERIOD maybe  it  's  the  diarrhea .PERIOD maybe  the  last  mile  problem  really  should  be  thought  of  as  the  last  mile  opportunity .PERIOD let  's  go  back  to  diabetes .PERIOD this  is  a  typical  insulin  injection .PERIOD now ,COMMA carrying  this  thing  around  is  complicated .PERIOD you  gotta  carry  the  bottle ,COMMA you  gotta  carry  the  syringe .PERIOD it  's  also  painful .PERIOD now ,COMMA you  may  think  to  yourself ,COMMA well ,COMMA if  my  eyes  depended  on  it ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA i  would  obviously  use  it  every  day  but  the  pain ,COMMA the  discomfort ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA paying  attention ,COMMA remembering  to  put  it  in  your  purse  when  you  go  on  a  long  trip ,COMMA these  are  the  day-to-day  of  life ,COMMA and  they  do  pose  problems .PERIOD here  is  an  innovation ,COMMA a  design  innovation .PERIOD this  is  a  pen ,COMMA it  's  called  an  insulin  pen ,COMMA preloaded .PERIOD the  needle  is  particularly  sharp .PERIOD you  just  gotta  carry  this  thing  around .PERIOD it  's  much  easier  to  use ,COMMA much  less  painful .PERIOD anywhere  between  five  and  10  percent  increase  in  adherence ,COMMA just  as  a  result  of  this .PERIOD that  's  what  i  'm  talking  about  as  a  last  mile  opportunity .PERIOD you  see ,COMMA we  tend  to  think  the  problem  is  solved  when  we  solve  the  technology  problem .PERIOD but  the  human  innovation ,COMMA the  human  problem  still  remains ,COMMA and  that  's  a  great  frontier  that  we  have  left .PERIOD this  is  n't  about  the  biology  of  people .PERIOD this  is  now  about  the  brains ,COMMA the  psychology  of  people .PERIOD and  innovation  needs  to  continue  all  the  way  through  the  last  mile .PERIOD here  's  another  example  of  this .PERIOD this  is  from  a  company  called  positive  energy .PERIOD this  is  about  energy  efficiency .PERIOD we  're  spending  a  lot  of  time  on  fuel  cells  right  now .PERIOD what  this  company  does  is  they  send  a  letter  to  households  that  say ,COMMA here  's  your  energy  use ,COMMA here  's  your  neighbor  's  energy  use ,COMMA you  're  doing  well  smiley  face .PERIOD you  're  doing  worse  frown .PERIOD and  what  they  find  is  just  this  letter ,COMMA nothing  else ,COMMA has  a  two  to  three  percent  reduction  in  electricity  use .PERIOD and  you  want  to  think  about  the  social  value  of  that  in  terms  of  carbon  offsets ,COMMA reduced  electricity ,COMMA 900  million  dollars  per  year .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK because  for  free ,COMMA this  is  n't  a  new  technology ,COMMA this  is  a  letter ,COMMA we  're  getting  a  big  bang  in  behavior .PERIOD so ,COMMA how  do  we  tackle  the  last  mile ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  this  tells  us  there  is  an  opportunity .PERIOD and  i  think  to  tackle  it ,COMMA we  need  to  combine  psychology ,COMMA marketing ,COMMA art ,COMMA we've  seen  that .PERIOD but  you  know  what  we  need  to  combine  it  with ?QUESTIONMARK we  need  to  combine  this  with  the  scientific  method .PERIOD see  what  's  really  puzzling  and  frustrating  about  the  last  mile ,COMMA to  me ,COMMA is  that  the  first  999  miles  are  all  about  science .PERIOD no  one  would  say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA i  think  this  medicine  works ,COMMA go  ahead  and  use  it .PERIOD we  have  testing ,COMMA we  go  to  the  lab ,COMMA we  try  it  again ,COMMA we  have  refinement .PERIOD but  you  know  what  we  do  on  the  last  mile ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA this  is  a  good  idea .PERIOD people  will  like  this .PERIOD let  's  put  it  out  there .PERIOD the  amount  of  resources  we  put  in  are  disparate .PERIOD we  put  billions  of  dollars  into  fuel-efficient  technologies .PERIOD how  much  are  we  putting  into  energy  behavior  change  in  a  credible ,COMMA systematic ,COMMA testing  way ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA i  think  that  we  're  on  the  verge  of  something  big .PERIOD we  're  on  the  verge  of  a  whole  new  social  science .PERIOD it  's  a  social  science  that  recognizes ,COMMA much  like  science  recognizes  the  complexity  of  the  body ,COMMA biology  recognizes  the  complexity  of  the  body ,COMMA we  'll  recognize  the  complexity  of  the  human  mind .PERIOD the  careful  testing ,COMMA retesting ,COMMA design .PERIOD are  going  to  open  up  vistas  of  understanding ,COMMA complexities ,COMMA difficult  things .PERIOD and  those  vistas  will  both  create  new  science ,COMMA and  fundamental  change  in  the  world  as  we  see  it ,COMMA in  the  next  hundred  years .PERIOD all  right .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD chris  anderson ,COMMA sendhil ,COMMA thank  you  so  much .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  whole  area  is  so  fascinating .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA it  sometimes  feels ,COMMA listening  to  behavioral  economists  that  they  are  kind  of  putting  into  place  academically ,COMMA what  great  marketers  have  sort  of  intuitively  known  for  a  long  time .PERIOD how  much  is  your  field  talking  to  great  marketers  about  their  insights  into  human  psychology ?QUESTIONMARK because  they've  seen  it  on  the  ground .PERIOD sendhil  mullainathan ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we  spend  a  lot  of  time  talking  to  marketers .PERIOD and  i  think  60  percent  of  it  is  exactly  what  you  say ,COMMA there  are  insights  to  be  gleaned  there .PERIOD forty  percent  of  it  is  about  what  marketing  is .PERIOD marketing  is  selling  an  ad  to  a  firm .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  some  sense ,COMMA a  lot  of  marketing  is  about  convincing  a  ceo ,COMMA this  is  a  good  ad  campaign .PERIOD so ,COMMA there  is  a  little  bit  of  slippage  there .PERIOD that  's  just  a  caveat .PERIOD that  's  different  from  actually  having  an  effective  ad  campaign .PERIOD and  one  of  the  new  movements  in  marketing  is ,COMMA how  do  we  actually  measure  effectiveness ?QUESTIONMARK are  we  effective ?QUESTIONMARK ca ,COMMA how  you  take  your  insights  here  and  actually  get  them  integrated  into  working  business  models  on  the  ground ,COMMA in  indian  villages ,COMMA for  example ?QUESTIONMARK sm ,COMMA so ,COMMA the  scientific  method  i  alluded  to  is  pretty  important .PERIOD we  work  closely  with  companies  that  have  operational  capacity ,COMMA or  nonprofits  that  have  operational  capacity .PERIOD and  then  we  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA you  want  to  get  this  behavior  change .PERIOD let  's  come  up  with  a  few  ideas ,COMMA test  them ,COMMA see  which  is  working ,COMMA go  back ,COMMA synthesize ,COMMA and  try  to  come  up  with  a  thing  that  works ,COMMA and  then  we  're  able  to  scale  with  partners .PERIOD it  's  kind  of  the  model  that  has  worked  in  other  contexts .PERIOD if  you  have  biological  problems  we  try  and  fix  it ,COMMA see  if  it  works ,COMMA and  then  work  the  scale .PERIOD ca ,COMMA alright  sendhil ,COMMA thanks  so  much  for  coming  to  ted .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD as  a  culture ,COMMA we  tell  ourselves  lots  of  stories  about  the  future ,COMMA and  where  we  might  move  forward  from  this  point .PERIOD some  of  those  stories  are  that  somebody  is  just  going  to  sort  everything  out  for  us .PERIOD other  stories  are  that  everything  is  on  the  verge  of  unraveling .PERIOD but  i  want  to  tell  you  a  different  story  here  today .PERIOD like  all  stories ,COMMA it  has  a  beginning .PERIOD my  work ,COMMA for  a  long  time ,COMMA has  been  involved  in  education ,COMMA in  teaching  people  practical  skills  for  sustainability .PERIOD teaching  people  how  to  take  responsibility  for  growing  some  of  their  own  food ,COMMA how  to  build  buildings  using  local  materials ,COMMA how  to  generate  their  own  energy ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD i  lived  in  ireland ,COMMA built  the  first  straw-bale  houses  in  ireland ,COMMA and  some  cob  buildings  and  all  this  kind  of  thing .PERIOD but  all  my  work  for  many  years  was  focused  around  the  idea  that  sustainability  means  basically  looking  at  the  globalized  economic  growth  model ,COMMA and  moderating  what  comes  in  at  one  end ,COMMA and  moderating  the  outputs  at  the  other  end .PERIOD and  then  i  came  into  contact  with  a  way  of  looking  at  things  which  actually  changed  that  profoundly .PERIOD and  in  order  to  introduce  you  to  that ,COMMA i've  got  something  here  that  i  'm  going  to  unveil .PERIOD which  is  one  of  the  great  marvels  of  the  modern  age .PERIOD and  it  's  something  so  astounding  and  so  astonishing  that  i  think  maybe  as  i  remove  this  cloth  a  suitable  gasp  of  amazement  might  be  appropriate .PERIOD if  you  could  help  me  with  that  it  would  be  fantastic .PERIOD this  is  a  liter  of  oil .PERIOD this  bottle  of  oil ,COMMA distilled  over  a  hundred  million  years  of  geological  time ,COMMA ancient  sunlight ,COMMA contains  the  energy  equivalent  of  about  five  weeks  hard  human  manual  labor ,COMMA equivalent  to  about  35  strong  people  coming  round  and  working  for  you .PERIOD we  can  turn  it  into  a  dazzling  array  of  materials ,COMMA medicine ,COMMA modern  clothing ,COMMA laptops ,COMMA a  whole  range  of  different  things .PERIOD it  gives  us  an  energy  return  that  's  unimaginable ,COMMA historically .PERIOD we've  based  the  design  of  our  settlements ,COMMA our  business  models ,COMMA our  transport  plans ,COMMA even  the  idea  of  economic  growth ,COMMA some  would  argue ,COMMA on  the  assumption  that  we  will  have  this  in  perpetuity .PERIOD yet ,COMMA when  we  take  a  step  back ,COMMA and  look  over  the  span  of  history ,COMMA at  what  we  might  call  the  petroleum  interval ,COMMA it  's  a  short  period  in  history  where  we've  discovered  this  extraordinary  material ,COMMA and  then  based  a  whole  way  of  life  around  it .PERIOD but  as  we  straddle  the  top  of  this  energy  mountain ,COMMA at  this  stage ,COMMA we  move  from  a  time  where  our  economic  success ,COMMA our  sense  of  individual  prowess  and  well-being  is  directly  linked  to  how  much  of  this  we  consume ,COMMA to  a  time  when  actually  our  degree  of  oil  dependency  is  our  degree  of  vulnerability .PERIOD and  it  's  increasingly  clear  that  we  are  n't  going  to  be  able  to  rely  on  the  fact  that  we  're  going  to  have  this  at  our  disposal  forever .PERIOD for  every  four  barrels  of  oil  that  we  consume ,COMMA we  only  discover  one .PERIOD and  that  gap  continues  to  widen .PERIOD there  is  also  the  fact  that  the  amount  of  energy  that  we  get  back  from  the  oil  that  we  discover  is  falling .PERIOD in  the  1930s  we  got  100  units  of  energy  back  for  every  one  that  we  put  in  to  extract  it .PERIOD completely  unprecedented ,COMMA historically .PERIOD already  that  's  fallen  to  about  11 .PERIOD and  that  's  why ,COMMA now ,COMMA the  new  breakthroughs ,COMMA the  new  frontiers  in  terms  of  oil  extraction  are  scrambling  about  in  alberta ,COMMA or  at  the  bottom  of  the  oceans .PERIOD there  are  98  oil-producing  nations  in  the  world .PERIOD but  of  those ,COMMA 65  have  already  passed  their  peak .PERIOD the  moment  when  the  world  on  average  passes  this  peak ,COMMA people  wonder  when  that  's  going  to  happen .PERIOD and  there  is  an  emerging  case  that  maybe  that  was  what  happened  last  july  when  the  oil  prices  were  so  high .PERIOD but  are  we  to  assume  that  the  same  brilliance  and  creativity  and  adaptability  that  got  us  up  to  the  top  of  that  energy  mountain  in  the  first  place  is  somehow  mysteriously  going  to  evaporate  when  we  have  to  design  a  creative  way  back  down  the  other  side ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD but  the  thinking  that  we  have  to  come  up  with  has  to  be  based  on  a  realistic  assessment  of  where  we  are .PERIOD there  is  also  the  issue  of  climate  change .PERIOD is  the  other  thing  that  underpins  this  transition  approach .PERIOD but  the  thing  that  i  notice ,COMMA as  i  talk  to  climate  scientists ,COMMA is  the  increasingly  terrified  look  they  have  in  their  eyes ,COMMA as  the  data  that  's  coming  in ,COMMA which  is  far  ahead  of  what  the  ipcc  are  talking  about .PERIOD so  the  ipcc  said  that  we  might  see  significant  breakup  of  the  arctic  ice  in  2100 ,COMMA in  their  worst  case  scenario .PERIOD actually ,COMMA if  current  trends  continue ,COMMA it  could  all  be  gone  in  five  or  10  years  time .PERIOD if  just  three  percent  of  the  carbon  locked  up  in  the  arctic  permafrost  is  released  as  the  world  warms ,COMMA it  would  offset  all  the  savings  that  we  need  to  make ,COMMA in  carbon ,COMMA over  the  next  40  years  to  avoid  runaway  climate  change .PERIOD we  have  no  choice  other  than  deep  and  urgent  decarbonization .PERIOD but  i  'm  always  very  interested  to  think  about  what  might  the  stories  be  that  the  generations  further  down  the  slope  from  us  are  going  to  tell  about  us .PERIOD the  generation  that  lived  at  the  top  of  the  mountain ,COMMA that  partied  so  hard ,COMMA and  so  abused  its  inheritance .PERIOD and  one  of  the  ways  i  like  to  do  that  is  to  look  back  at  the  stories  people  used  to  tell  before  we  had  cheap  oil ,COMMA before  we  had  fossil  fuels ,COMMA and  people  relied  on  their  own  muscle ,COMMA animal  muscle  energy ,COMMA or  a  little  bit  of  wind ,COMMA little  bit  of  water  energy .PERIOD we  had  stories  like  the  seven-league  boots ,COMMA the  giant  who  had  these  boots ,COMMA where ,COMMA once  you  put  them  on ,COMMA with  every  stride  you  could  cover  seven  leagues ,COMMA or  21  miles ,COMMA a  kind  of  travel  completely  unimaginable  to  people  without  that  kind  of  energy  at  their  disposal .PERIOD stories  like  the  magic  porridge  pot ,COMMA where  you  had  a  pot  where  if  you  knew  the  magic  words ,COMMA this  pot  would  just  make  as  much  food  as  you  liked ,COMMA without  you  having  to  do  any  work ,COMMA provided  you  could  remember  the  other  magic  word  to  stop  it  making  porridge .PERIOD otherwise  you'd  flood  your  entire  town  with  warm  porridge .PERIOD there  is  the  story  of  the  elves  and  the  shoemaker  the  people  who  make  shoes  go  to  sleep ,COMMA wake  up  in  the  morning ,COMMA and  all  the  shoes  are  magically  made  for  them .PERIOD it  's  something  that  was  unimaginable  to  people  then .PERIOD now  we  have  the  seven-league  boots  in  the  form  of  ryanair  and  easyjet .PERIOD we  have  the  magic  porridge  pot  in  the  form  of  walmart  and  tesco .PERIOD and  we  have  the  elves  in  the  form  of  china .PERIOD but  we  do  n't  appreciate  what  an  astonishing  thing  that  has  been .PERIOD and  what  are  the  stories  that  we  tell  ourselves  now ,COMMA as  we  look  forward  about  where  we  're  going  to  go .PERIOD and  i  would  argue  that  there  are  four .PERIOD there  is  the  idea  of  business  as  usual ,COMMA that  the  future  will  be  like  the  present ,COMMA just  more  of  it .PERIOD but  as  we've  seen  over  the  last  year ,COMMA i  think  that  's  an  idea  that  is  increasingly  coming  into  question .PERIOD and  in  terms  of  climate  change ,COMMA is  something  that  is  not  actually  feasible .PERIOD there  is  the  idea  of  hitting  the  wall ,COMMA that  actually  somehow  everything  is  so  fragile  that  it  might  just  all  unravel  and  collapse .PERIOD this  is  a  popular  story  in  some  places .PERIOD the  third  story  is  the  idea  that  technology  can  solve  everything ,COMMA that  technology  can  somehow  get  us  through  this  completely .PERIOD and  it  's  an  idea  that  i  think  is  very  prevalent  at  these  ted  talks ,COMMA the  idea  that  we  can  invent  our  way  out  of  a  profound  economic  and  energy  crisis ,COMMA that  a  move  to  a  knowledge  economy  can  somehow  neatly  sidestep  those  energy  constraints ,COMMA the  idea  that  we  'll  discover  some  fabulous  new  source  of  energy  that  will  mean  we  can  sweep  all  concerns  about  energy  security  to  one  side ,COMMA the  idea  that  we  can  step  off  neatly  onto  a  completely  renewable  world .PERIOD but  the  world  is  n't  second  life .PERIOD we  cannot  create  new  land  and  new  energy  systems  at  the  click  of  a  mouse .PERIOD and  as  we  sit ,COMMA exchanging  free  ideas  with  each  other ,COMMA there  are  still  people  mining  coal  in  order  to  power  the  servers ,COMMA extracting  the  minerals  to  make  all  of  those  things .PERIOD the  breakfast  that  we  eat  as  we  sit  down  to  check  our  email  in  the  morning  is  still  transported  at  great  distances ,COMMA usually  at  the  expense  of  the  local ,COMMA more  resilient  food  systems  that  would  have  supplied  that  in  the  past ,COMMA which  we've  so  effectively  devalued  and  dismantled .PERIOD we  can  be  astonishingly  inventive  and  creative .PERIOD but  we  also  live  in  a  world  with  very  real  constraints  and  demands .PERIOD energy  and  technology  are  not  the  same  thing .PERIOD what  i  'm  involved  with  is  the  transition  response .PERIOD and  this  is  really  about  looking  the  challenges  of  peak  oil  and  climate  change  square  in  the  face ,COMMA and  responding  with  a  creativity  and  an  adaptability  and  an  imagination  that  we  really  need .PERIOD it  's  something  which  has  spread  incredibly  fast .PERIOD and  it  is  something  which  has  several  characteristics .PERIOD it  's  viral .PERIOD it  seems  to  spread  under  the  radar  very ,COMMA very  quickly .PERIOD it  's  open  source .PERIOD it  's  something  which  everybody  who  's  involved  with  it  develops  and  passes  on  as  they  work  with  it .PERIOD it  's  self-organizing .PERIOD there  is  no  great  central  organization  that  pushes  this .PERIOD people  just  pick  up  an  idea  and  they  run  with  it ,COMMA and  they  implement  it  where  they  are .PERIOD it  's  solutions-focused .PERIOD it  's  very  much  looking  at  what  people  can  do  where  they  are ,COMMA to  respond  to  this .PERIOD it  's  sensitive  to  place  and  to  scale .PERIOD transitional  is  completely  different .PERIOD transition  groups  in  chile ,COMMA transition  groups  in  the  us ,COMMA transition  groups  here ,COMMA what  they  're  doing  looks  very  different  in  every  place  that  you  go  to .PERIOD it  learns  very  much  from  its  mistakes .PERIOD and  it  feels  historic .PERIOD it  tries  to  create  a  sense  that  this  is  a  historic  opportunity  to  do  something  really  extraordinary .PERIOD and  it  's  a  process  which  is  really  joyful .PERIOD people  have  a  huge  amount  of  fun  doing  this ,COMMA reconnecting  with  other  people  as  they  do  it .PERIOD one  of  the  things  that  underpins  it  is  this  idea  of  resilience .PERIOD and  i  think ,COMMA in  many  ways ,COMMA the  idea  of  resilience  is  a  more  useful  concept  than  the  idea  of  sustainability .PERIOD the  idea  of  resilience  comes  from  the  study  of  ecology .PERIOD and  it  's  really  about  how  systems ,COMMA settlements ,COMMA withstand  shock  from  the  outside .PERIOD when  they  encounter  shock  from  the  outside  that  they  do  n't  just  unravel  and  fall  to  pieces .PERIOD and  i  think  it  's  a  more  useful  concept  than  sustainability ,COMMA as  i  said .PERIOD when  our  supermarkets  have  only  two  or  three  days  worth  of  food  in  them  at  any  one  time ,COMMA often  sustainability  tends  to  focus  on  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  freezers  and  on  the  packaging  that  the  lettuces  are  wrapped  up  in .PERIOD looking  through  the  lens  of  resilience ,COMMA we  really  question  how  we've  let  ourselves  get  into  a  situation  that  's  so  vulnerable .PERIOD resilience  runs  much  deeper ,COMMA it  's  about  building  modularity  into  what  we  do ,COMMA building  surge  breakers  into  how  we  organize  the  basic  things  that  support  us .PERIOD this  is  a  photograph  of  the  bristol  and  district  market  gardeners  association ,COMMA in  1897 .PERIOD this  is  at  a  time  when  the  city  of  bristol ,COMMA which  is  quite  close  to  here ,COMMA was  surrounded  by  commercial  market  gardens ,COMMA which  provided  a  significant  amount  of  the  food  that  was  consumed  in  the  town ,COMMA and  created  a  lot  of  employment  for  people ,COMMA as  well .PERIOD there  was  a  degree  of  resilience ,COMMA if  you  like ,COMMA at  that  time ,COMMA which  we  can  now  only  look  back  on  with  envy .PERIOD so  how  does  this  transition  idea  work ?QUESTIONMARK so  basically ,COMMA you  have  a  group  of  people  who  are  excited  by  the  idea .PERIOD they  pick  up  some  of  the  tools  that  we've  developed .PERIOD they  start  to  run  an  awareness-raising  program  looking  at  how  this  might  actually  work  in  the  town .PERIOD they  show  films ,COMMA they  give  talks ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD it  's  a  process  which  is  playful  and  creative .PERIOD and  informative .PERIOD then  they  start  to  form  working  groups ,COMMA looking  at  different  aspects  of  this ,COMMA and  then  from  that ,COMMA there  emerge  a  whole  lot  of  projects  which  then  the  transition  project  itself  starts  to  support  and  enable .PERIOD so  it  started  out  with  some  work  i  was  involved  in  in  ireland ,COMMA where  i  was  teaching ,COMMA and  has  since  spread .PERIOD there  are  now  over  200  formal  transition  projects .PERIOD and  there  are  thousands  of  others  who  are  at  what  we  call  the  mulling  stage .PERIOD they  are  mulling  whether  they  're  going  to  take  it  further .PERIOD and  actually  a  lot  of  them  are  doing  huge  amounts  of  stuff .PERIOD but  what  do  they  actually  do ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ,COMMA it  's  a  kind  of  nice  idea ,COMMA but  what  do  they  actually  do  on  the  ground ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA i  think  it  's  really  important  to  make  the  point  that  actually  you  know ,COMMA this  is  n't  something  which  is  going  to  do  everything  on  its  own .PERIOD we  need  international  legislation  from  copenhagen  and  so  on .PERIOD we  need  national  responses .PERIOD we  need  local  government  responses .PERIOD but  all  of  those  things  are  going  to  be  much  easier  if  we  have  communities  that  are  vibrant  and  coming  up  with  ideas  and  leading  from  the  front ,COMMA making  unelectable  policies  electable ,COMMA over  the  next  5  to  10  years .PERIOD some  of  the  things  that  emerge  from  it  are  local  food  projects ,COMMA like  community-supported  agriculture  schemes ,COMMA urban  food  production ,COMMA creating  local  food  directories ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD a  lot  of  places  now  are  starting  to  set  up  their  own  energy  companies ,COMMA community-owned  energy  companies ,COMMA where  the  community  can  invest  money  into  itself ,COMMA to  start  putting  in  place  the  kind  of  renewable  energy  infrastructure  that  we  need .PERIOD a  lot  of  places  are  working  with  their  local  schools .PERIOD newent  in  the  forest  of  dean ,COMMA big  polytunnel  they  built  for  the  school .PERIOD the  kids  are  learning  how  to  grow  food .PERIOD promoting  recycling ,COMMA things  like  garden-share ,COMMA that  matches  up  people  who  do  n't  have  a  garden  who  would  like  to  grow  food ,COMMA with  people  who  have  gardens  they  are  n't  using  anymore .PERIOD planting  productive  trees  throughout  urban  spaces .PERIOD and  also  starting  to  play  around  with  the  idea  of  alternative  currencies .PERIOD this  is  lewes  in  sussex ,COMMA who  have  recently  launched  the  lewes  pound ,COMMA a  currency  that  you  can  only  spend  within  the  town ,COMMA as  a  way  of  starting  to  cycle  money  within  the  local  economy .PERIOD you  take  it  anywhere  else ,COMMA it  's  not  worth  anything .PERIOD but  actually  within  the  town  you  start  to  create  these  economic  cycles  much  more  effectively .PERIOD another  thing  that  they  do  is  what  we  call  an  energy  descent  plan ,COMMA which  is  basically  to  develop  a  plan  b  for  the  town .PERIOD most  of  our  local  authorities ,COMMA when  they  sit  down  to  plan  for  the  next  five ,COMMA 10 ,COMMA 15 ,COMMA 20  years  of  a  community ,COMMA still  start  by  assuming  that  there  will  be  more  energy ,COMMA more  cars ,COMMA more  housing ,COMMA more  jobs ,COMMA more  growth ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD what  does  it  look  like  if  that  's  not  the  case ?QUESTIONMARK and  how  can  we  embrace  that  and  actually  come  up  with  something  that  was  actually  more  likely  to  sustain  everybody ?QUESTIONMARK as  a  friend  of  mine  says ,COMMA life  is  a  series  of  things  you  're  not  quite  ready  for  and  that  's  certainly  been  my  experience  with  transition .PERIOD from  three  years  ago ,COMMA it  just  being  an  idea ,COMMA this  has  become  something  that  has  virally  swept  around  the  world .PERIOD we  're  getting  a  lot  of  interest  from  government .PERIOD ed  miliband .PERIOD the  energy  minister  of  this  country ,COMMA was  invited  to  come  to  our  recent  conference  as  a  keynote  listener .PERIOD which  he  did  -- .PERIOD --  and  has  since  become  a  great  advocate  of  the  whole  idea .PERIOD there  are  now  two  local  authorities  in  this  country  who  have  declared  themselves  transitional  local  authorities ,COMMA leicestershire  and  somerset .PERIOD and  in  stroud ,COMMA the  transition  group  there ,COMMA in  effect ,COMMA wrote  the  local  government  's  food  plan .PERIOD and  the  head  of  the  council  said ,COMMA if  we  did  n't  have  transition  stroud ,COMMA we  would  have  to  invent  all  of  that  community  infrastructure  for  the  first  time .PERIOD as  we  see  the  spread  of  it ,COMMA we  see  national  hubs  emerging .PERIOD in  scotland ,COMMA the  scottish  government  's  climate  change  fund  has  funded  transition  scotland  as  a  national  organization  supporting  the  spread  of  this .PERIOD and  we  see  it  all  over  the  place  as  well  now .PERIOD but  the  key  to  transition  is  thinking  not  that  we  have  to  change  everything  now ,COMMA but  that  things  are  already  inevitably  changing .PERIOD and  what  we  need  to  do  is  to  work  creatively  with  that ,COMMA based  on  asking  the  right  questions .PERIOD i  think  i'd  like  to  just  return  at  the  end  to  the  idea  of  stories .PERIOD because  i  think  stories  are  vital  here .PERIOD and  actually  the  stories  that  we  tell  ourselves ,COMMA we  have  a  huge  dearth  of  stories  about  how  to  move  forward  creatively  from  here .PERIOD and  one  of  the  key  things  that  transition  does  is  to  pull  those  stories  out  of  what  people  are  doing .PERIOD stories  about  the  community  that  's  produced  its  own  21  pound  note ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA the  school  that  's  turned  its  car  park  into  a  food  garden ,COMMA the  community  that  's  founded  its  own  energy  company .PERIOD and  for  me ,COMMA one  of  the  great  stories  recently  was  the  obamas  digging  up  the  south  lawn  of  the  white  house  to  create  a  vegetable  garden .PERIOD because  the  last  time  that  was  done ,COMMA when  eleanor  roosevelt  did  it ,COMMA it  led  to  the  creation  of  20  million  vegetable  gardens  across  the  united  states .PERIOD so  the  question  i'd  like  to  leave  you  with ,COMMA really ,COMMA is ,COMMA for  all  aspects  of  the  things  that  your  community  needs  in  order  to  thrive ,COMMA how  can  it  be  done  in  such  a  way  that  drastically  reduces  its  carbon  emissions ,COMMA while  also  building  resilience ?QUESTIONMARK personally ,COMMA i  feel  enormously  grateful  to  have  lived  through  the  age  of  cheap  oil .PERIOD i've  been  astonishingly  lucky ,COMMA we've  been  astonishingly  lucky .PERIOD but  let  us  honor  what  it  has  bought  us ,COMMA and  move  forward  from  this  point .PERIOD because  if  we  cling  to  it ,COMMA and  continue  to  assume  that  it  can  underpin  our  choices ,COMMA the  future  that  it  presents  to  us  is  one  which  is  really  unmanageable .PERIOD and  by  loving  and  leaving  all  that  oil  has  done  for  us ,COMMA and  that  the  oil  age  has  done  for  us ,COMMA we  are  able  to  then  begin  the  creation  of  a  world  which  is  more  resilient ,COMMA more  nourishing ,COMMA and  in  which ,COMMA we  find  ourselves  fitter ,COMMA more  skilled  and  more  connected  to  each  other .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD of  the  five  senses ,COMMA vision  is  the  one  that  i  appreciate  the  most ,COMMA and  it  's  the  one  that  i  can  least  take  for  granted .PERIOD i  think  this  is  partially  due  to  my  father ,COMMA who  was  blind .PERIOD it  was  a  fact  that  he  did  n't  make  much  of  a  fuss  about ,COMMA usually .PERIOD one  time  in  nova  scotia ,COMMA when  we  went  to  see  a  total  eclipse  of  the  sun ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA same  one  as  in  the  carly  simon  song ,COMMA which  may  or  may  not  refer  to  james  taylor ,COMMA warren  beatty  or  mick  jagger .PERIOD we  're  not  really  sure .PERIOD they  handed  out  these  dark  plastic  viewers  that  allowed  us  to  look  directly  at  the  sun  without  damaging  our  eyes .PERIOD but  dad  got  really  scared ,COMMA he  did  n't  want  us  doing  that .PERIOD he  wanted  us  instead  to  use  these  cheap  cardboard  viewers  so  that  there  was  no  chance  at  all  that  our  eyes  would  be  damaged .PERIOD i  thought  this  was  a  little  strange  at  the  time .PERIOD what  i  did  n't  know  at  the  time  was  that  my  father  had  actually  been  born  with  perfect  eyesight .PERIOD when  he  and  his  sister  martha  were  just  very  little ,COMMA their  mom  took  them  out  to  see  a  total  eclipse ,COMMA or  actually ,COMMA a  solar  eclipse ,COMMA and  not  long  after  that ,COMMA both  of  them  started  losing  their  eyesight .PERIOD decades  later ,COMMA it  turned  out  that  the  source  of  their  blindness  was  most  likely  some  sort  of  bacterial  infection .PERIOD as  near  as  we  can  tell ,COMMA it  had  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  that  solar  eclipse ,COMMA but  by  then  my  grandmother  had  already  gone  to  her  grave  thinking  it  was  her  fault .PERIOD so ,COMMA dad  graduated  harvard  in  1946 ,COMMA married  my  mom ,COMMA and  bought  a  house  in  lexington ,COMMA massachusetts ,COMMA where  the  first  shots  were  fired  against  the  british  in  1775 ,COMMA although  we  did  n't  actually  hit  any  of  them  until  concord .PERIOD he  got  a  job  working  for  raytheon ,COMMA designing  guidance  systems ,COMMA which  was  part  of  the  route  128  high-tech  axis  in  those  days ,COMMA so  the  equivalent  of  silicone  valley  in  the  70s .PERIOD dad  was  n't  a  real  militaristic  kind  of  guy .PERIOD he  just  really  felt  bad  that  he  was  n't  able  to  fight  in  world  war  ii  on  account  of  his  handicap ,COMMA although  they  did  let  him  get  through  the  several-hour-long  army  physical  exam  before  they  got  to  the  very  last  test ,COMMA which  was  for  vision .PERIOD so ,COMMA dad  started  racking  up  all  of  these  patents  and  gaining  a  reputation  as  a  blind  genius ,COMMA rocket  scientist ,COMMA inventor .PERIOD but  to  us  he  was  just  dad ,COMMA and  our  home  life  was  pretty  normal .PERIOD as  a  kid ,COMMA i  watched  a  lot  of  television  and  had  lots  of  nerdy  hobbies  like  mineralogy  and  microbiology  and  the  space  program  and  a  little  bit  of  politics .PERIOD i  played  a  lot  of  chess .PERIOD but  at  the  age  of  14 ,COMMA a  friend  of  mine  got  me  interested  in  comic  books ,COMMA and  i  decided  that  was  what  i  wanted  to  do  for  a  living .PERIOD so ,COMMA here  's  my  dad ,COMMA he  's  a  scientist ,COMMA he  's  an  engineer  and  he  's  a  military  contractor .PERIOD so ,COMMA he  has  four  kids ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK one  grows  up  to  become  a  computer  scientist ,COMMA one  grows  up  to  join  the  navy ,COMMA one  grows  up  to  become  an  engineer ,COMMA and  then  there  's  me ,COMMA the  comic  book  artist .PERIOD which ,COMMA incidentally ,COMMA makes  me  the  opposite  of  dean  kamen ,COMMA because  i  'm  a  comic  book  artist ,COMMA son  of  an  inventor ,COMMA and  he  's  an  inventor ,COMMA son  of  a  comic  book  artist .PERIOD right ,COMMA it  's  true .PERIOD the  funny  thing  is ,COMMA dad  had  a  lot  of  faith  in  me .PERIOD he  had  faith  in  my  abilities  as  a  cartoonist ,COMMA even  though  he  had  no  direct  evidence  that  i  was  any  good  whatsoever ,COMMA everything  he  saw  was  just  a  blur .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  gives  a  real  meaning  to  the  term  blind  faith ,COMMA which  does  n't  have  the  same  negative  connotation  for  me  that  it  does  for  other  people .PERIOD now ,COMMA faith  in  things  which  cannot  be  seen ,COMMA which  cannot  be  proved ,COMMA is  not  the  sort  of  faith  that  i've  ever  really  related  to  all  that  much .PERIOD i  tend  to  like  science ,COMMA where  what  we  see  and  can  ascertain  are  the  foundation  of  what  we  know .PERIOD but  there  's  a  middle  ground ,COMMA too .PERIOD a  middle  ground  tread  by  people  like  poor  old  charles  babbage ,COMMA and  his  steam-driven  computers  that  were  never  built .PERIOD nobody  really  understood  what  it  was  that  he  had  in  mind ,COMMA except  for  ada  lovelace ,COMMA and  he  went  to  his  grave  trying  to  pursue  that  dream .PERIOD vannevar  bush  with  his  memex ,COMMA this  idea  of  all  of  human  knowledge  at  your  fingertips ,COMMA he  had  this  vision .PERIOD and  i  think  a  lot  of  people  in  his  day  probably  thought  he  was  a  bit  of  a  kook .PERIOD and ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we  can  look  back  in  retrospect  and  say ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA ha-ha ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA it  's  all  microfilm .PERIOD but  that  's  -- .PERIOD that  's  not  the  point .PERIOD he  understood  the  shape  of  the  future .PERIOD so  did  jcr .PERIOD licklider  and  his  notions  for  computer-human  interaction .PERIOD same  thing ,COMMA he  understood  the  shape  of  the  future ,COMMA even  though  it  was  something  that  would  only  be  implemented  by  people  much  later .PERIOD or  paul  baran ,COMMA and  his  vision  for  packet  switching .PERIOD hardly  anybody  listened  to  him  in  his  day .PERIOD or  even  the  people  who  actually  pulled  it  off ,COMMA the  people  at  bolt ,COMMA beranek  and  newman  in  boston ,COMMA who  just  would  sketch  out  these  structures  of  what  would  eventually  become  a  worldwide  network ,COMMA and  sketching  things  on  the  back  of  napkins  and  on  note  papers  and  arguing  over  dinner  at  howard  johnson  's ,COMMA on  route  128  in  lexington ,COMMA massachusetts ,COMMA just  two  miles  from  where  i  was  studying  the  queen  's  gambit  deferred  and  listening  to  gladys  knight  &amp .PERIOD the  pips  singing  midnight  train  to  georgia ,COMMA while ,COMMA in  my  dad  's  big  easy  chair ,COMMA you  know ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA three  types  of  vision ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK vision  based  on  what  one  cannot  see ,COMMA the  vision  of  that  unseen  and  unknowable .PERIOD the  vision  of  that  which  has  already  been  proven  or  can  be  ascertained .PERIOD and  this  third  kind  of  vision ,COMMA of  something  which  can  be ,COMMA which  may  be ,COMMA based  on  knowledge ,COMMA but  is  as  yet  unproven .PERIOD now ,COMMA we've  seen  a  lot  of  examples  of  people  who  are  pursuing  that  sort  of  vision  in  science ,COMMA but  i  think  it  's  also  true  in  the  arts ,COMMA it  's  true  in  politics ,COMMA it  's  even  true  in  personal  endeavors .PERIOD what  it  comes  down  to ,COMMA really ,COMMA is  four  basic  principles ,COMMA learn  from  everyone ,COMMA follow  no  one ,COMMA watch  for  patterns ,COMMA and  work  like  hell .PERIOD i  think  these  are  the  four  principles  that  go  into  this .PERIOD and  it  's  that  third  one ,COMMA especially ,COMMA where  visions  of  the  future  begin  to  manifest  themselves .PERIOD what  's  interesting  is  that  this  particular  way  of  looking  at  the  world ,COMMA is ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA only  one  of  four  different  ways  that  manifest  themselves  in  different  fields  of  endeavor .PERIOD in  comics ,COMMA i  know  that  it  results  in  sort  of  a  formalist  attitude  towards  trying  to  understand  how  it  works .PERIOD then  there  's  another ,COMMA more  classical ,COMMA attitude  which  embraces  beauty  and  craft .PERIOD another  one  which  believes  in  the  pure  transparency  of  content .PERIOD and  then  another  which  emphasizes  the  authenticity  of  human  experience ,COMMA and  honesty ,COMMA and  rawness .PERIOD these  are  four  very  different  ways  of  looking  at  the  world .PERIOD i  even  gave  them  names .PERIOD the  classicist ,COMMA the  animist ,COMMA and  formalist  and  iconoclast .PERIOD interestingly ,COMMA it  seemed  to  correspond  more  or  less  to  jung  's  four  subdivisions  of  human  thought .PERIOD and  they  reflect  a  dichotomy  of  art  and  delight  on  left  and  the  right .PERIOD tradition  and  revolution  on  the  top  and  the  bottom .PERIOD and  if  you  go  on  the  diagonal ,COMMA you  get  content  and  form ,COMMA and  then  beauty  and  truth .PERIOD and  it  probably  applies  just  as  much  to  music  and  to  movies  and  to  fine  art ,COMMA which  has  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  vision  at  all ,COMMA or  for  that  matter ,COMMA nothing  to  do  with  our  conference  theme  of  inspired  by  nature ,COMMA except  to  the  extent  of  the  fable  of  the  frog  who  gives  the  ride  to  the  scorpion  on  his  back  to  get  across  the  river  because  the  scorpion  promises  not  to  sting  him ,COMMA but  then  the  scorpion  does  sting  him  anyway  and  they  both  die ,COMMA but  not  before  the  frog  asks  him  why  and  the  scorpion  says ,COMMA because  it  's  my  nature ,COMMA in  that  sense ,COMMA yes .PERIOD so ,COMMA so  this  was  my  nature .PERIOD the  thing  was ,COMMA i  saw  that  the  route  that  i  took  to  discovering  this  focus  in  my  work  and  who  i  was ,COMMA i  saw  it  as  just  this  road  to  discovery .PERIOD actually ,COMMA it  was  just  me  embracing  my  nature ,COMMA which  means  that  i  did  n't  actually  fall  that  far  from  the  tree  after  all .PERIOD so  what  does  a  scientific  mind  do  in  the  arts ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA i  started  making  comics ,COMMA but  i  also  started  trying  to  understand  them ,COMMA almost  immediately .PERIOD and  one  of  the  most  important  things  about  comics ,COMMA i  discovered ,COMMA was  that  comics  are  a  visual  medium ,COMMA but  they  try  to  embrace  all  of  the  senses  within  it .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  different  elements  of  comics ,COMMA like  pictures  and  words ,COMMA and  the  different  symbols  and  everything  in  between  that  comics  presents  are  all  funneled  through  the  single  conduit  of  vision .PERIOD so  you  have  things  like  resemblance ,COMMA where  something  which  resembles  the  physical  world  can  be  abstracted  in  a  couple  of  different  directions ,COMMA abstracted  from  resemblance ,COMMA but  still  retaining  the  complete  meaning ,COMMA or  abstracted  away  from  both  resemblance  and  meaning  towards  the  picture  plan .PERIOD put  all  these  three  together ,COMMA and  you  have  a  nice  little  map  of  the  entire  boundary  of  visual  iconography  which  comics  can  embrace .PERIOD and  if  you  move  to  the  right  you  also  get  language ,COMMA because  that  's  abstracting  even  further  from  resemblance ,COMMA but  still  maintaining  meaning .PERIOD vision  is  called  upon  to  represent  sound  and  to  understand  the  common  properties  of  those  two  and  their  common  heritage ,COMMA as  well .PERIOD also ,COMMA to  try  to  represent  the  texture  of  sound  to  capture  its  essential  character  through  visuals .PERIOD and  there  's  also  a  balance  between  the  visible  and  the  invisible  in  comics .PERIOD comics  is  a  kind  of  call  and  response  in  which  the  artist  gives  you  something  to  see  within  the  panels ,COMMA and  then  gives  you  something  to  imagine  between  the  panels .PERIOD also ,COMMA another  sense  which  comics  vision  represents ,COMMA and  that  's  time .PERIOD sequence  is  a  very  important  aspect  of  comics .PERIOD comics  presents  a  kind  of  temporal  map .PERIOD and  this  temporal  map  was  something  that  energizes  modern  comics ,COMMA but  i  was  wondering  if  perhaps  it  also  energizes  other  sorts  of  forms ,COMMA and  i  found  some  in  history .PERIOD and  you  can  see  this  same  principle  operating  in  these  ancient  versions  of  the  same  idea .PERIOD what  's  happening  is ,COMMA the  art  form  is  colliding  with  the  given  technology ,COMMA whether  it  's  paint  on  stone ,COMMA like  the  tomb  of  the  scribe  in  ancient  egypt ,COMMA or  a  bas-relief  sculpture  rising  up  a  stone  column ,COMMA or  a  200-foot-long  embroidery ,COMMA or  painted  deerskin  and  tree  bark  running  across  88  accordion-folded  pages .PERIOD what  's  interesting  is ,COMMA once  you  hit  print ,COMMA and  this  is  from  1450 ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA all  of  the  artifacts  of  modern  comics  start  to  present  themselves ,COMMA rectilinear  panel  arrangements ,COMMA simple  line  drawings  without  tone  and  a  left-to-right  reading  sequence .PERIOD and  within  100  years ,COMMA you  already  start  to  see  word  balloons  and  captions ,COMMA and  it  's  really  just  a  hop ,COMMA skip  and  a  jump  from  here  to  here .PERIOD so  i  wrote  a  book  about  this  in  93 ,COMMA but  as  i  was  finishing  the  book ,COMMA i  had  to  do  a  little  bit  of  typesetting ,COMMA and  i  was  tired  of  going  to  my  local  copy  shop  to  do  it ,COMMA so  i  bought  a  computer .PERIOD and  it  was  just  a  little  thing ,COMMA it  was  n't  good  for  much  except  text  entry ,COMMA but  my  father  had  told  me  about  moore  's  law ,COMMA about  moore  's  law  back  in  the  70s ,COMMA and  i  knew  what  was  coming .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA i  kept  my  eyes  peeled  to  see  if  the  sort  of  changes  that  happened  when  we  went  from  pre-print  comics  to  print  comics  would  happen  when  we  went  beyond ,COMMA to  post-print  comics .PERIOD so ,COMMA one  of  the  first  things  that  were  proposed  was  that  we  could  mix  the  visuals  of  comics  with  the  sound ,COMMA motion  and  interactivity  of  the  cd-roms.  that  were  being  made  in  those  days .PERIOD this  was  even  before  the  web .PERIOD and  one  of  the  first  things  they  did  was ,COMMA they  tried  to  take  the  comics  page  as-is  and  transplant  it  to  monitors ,COMMA which  was  a  classic  mcluhanesque  mistake  of  appropriating  the  shape  of  the  previous  technology  as  the  content  of  the  new  technology .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA what  they  would  do  is ,COMMA they'd  have  these  comic  pages  that  resemble  print  comics  pages ,COMMA and  they  would  introduce  all  this  sound  and  motion .PERIOD the  problem  was ,COMMA that  if  you  go  with  this  idea ,COMMA this  basic  idea  that  space  equals  time  in  comics ,COMMA what  happens  is  that  when  you  introduce  sound  and  motion ,COMMA which  are  temporal  phenomena  that  can  only  be  represented  through  time ,COMMA then  they  break  with  that  continuity  of  presentation .PERIOD interactivity  was  another  thing .PERIOD there  were  hypertext  comics .PERIOD but  the  thing  about  hypertext  is  that  everything  in  hypertext  is  either  here ,COMMA not  here  or  connected  to  here .PERIOD it  's  profoundly  non-spatial .PERIOD the  distance  from  abraham  lincoln  to  a  lincoln  penny ,COMMA the  penny  marshall  to  the  marshall  plan  to  plan  9  to  nine  lives ,COMMA it  's  all  the  same .PERIOD and ,COMMA but  in  comics ,COMMA in  comics ,COMMA every  aspect  of  the  work ,COMMA every  element  of  the  work  has  a  spatial  relationship  to  every  other  element  at  all  times .PERIOD so  the  question  was ,COMMA was  there  any  way  to  preserve  that  spatial  relationship  while  still  taking  advantage  of  all  of  the  things  that  digital  had  to  offer  us ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  found  my  personal  answer  for  this  in  those  ancient  comics  that  i  was  showing  you .PERIOD each  of  them  has  a  single  unbroken  reading  line ,COMMA whether  it  's  going  zigzag  across  the  walls  or  spiraling  up  a  column  or  just  straight  left  to  right ,COMMA or  even  going  in  a  backwards  zigzag  across  those  88  accordion-folded  pages .PERIOD the  same  thing  is  happening ,COMMA and  that  is  that  the  basic  idea  that  as  you  move  through  space  you  move  through  time  is  being  carried  out  without  any  compromise ,COMMA but  there  were  compromises  when  print  hit .PERIOD adjacent  spaces  were  no  longer  adjacent  moments ,COMMA so  the  basic  idea  of  comics  was  being  broken  again  and  again  and  again  and  again .PERIOD and  i  thought ,COMMA ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA if  that  's  true ,COMMA is  there  any  way ,COMMA when  we  go  beyond  today  's  print ,COMMA to  somehow  bring  that  back ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA the  monitor  is  just  as  limited  as  the  page ,COMMA technically ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  a  different  shape ,COMMA but  other  than  that  it  's  the  same  basic  limitation .PERIOD but  that  's  only  if  you  look  at  the  monitor  as  a  page ,COMMA but  not  if  you  look  at  the  monitor  as  a  window .PERIOD and  that  's  what  i  proposed ,COMMA that  perhaps  we  could  create  these  comics  on  an  infinite  canvas ,COMMA along  the  x  axis  and  the  y  axis  and  staircases .PERIOD we  could  do  circular  narratives  that  were  literally  circular .PERIOD we  could  do  a  turn  in  a  story  that  was  literally  a  turn .PERIOD parallel  narratives  could  be  literally  parallel .PERIOD x ,COMMA y  and  also  z .PERIOD so  i  had  all  these  notions .PERIOD this  was  back  in  the  late  90s ,COMMA and  other  people  in  my  business  thought  i  was  pretty  crazy ,COMMA but  a  lot  of  people  then  went  on  and  actually  did  it .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  couple  now .PERIOD this  was  an  early  collage  comic  by  a  fellow  named  jason  lex .PERIOD and  notice  what  's  going  on  here .PERIOD what  i  'm  searching  for  is  a  durable  mutation ,COMMA that  's  what  all  of  us  are  searching  for .PERIOD as  media  head  into  this  new  era ,COMMA we  are  looking  for  mutations  that  are  durable ,COMMA that  have  some  sort  of  staying  power .PERIOD now ,COMMA we  're  taking  this  basic  idea  of  presenting  comics  in  a  visual  medium ,COMMA and  then  we  're  carrying  it  through  all  the  way  from  beginning  to  end .PERIOD that  's  that  entire  comic  you  just  saw  is  up  on  the  screen  right  now .PERIOD but  even  though  we  're  only  experiencing  it  one  piece  at  a  time ,COMMA that  's  just  where  the  technology  is  right  now .PERIOD as  the  technology  evolves ,COMMA as  you  get  full  immersive  displays  and  whatnot ,COMMA this  sort  of  thing  will  only  grow .PERIOD it  will  adapt .PERIOD it  will .PERIOD adapt  to  its  environment ,COMMA it  's  a  durable  mutation .PERIOD here  's  another  one  i  'll  show  you .PERIOD this  is  by  dr.ew  weing .PERIOD this  is  called ,COMMA pup  contemplates  the  heat  death  of  the  universe  see  what  's  going  on  here  as  we  draw  these  stories  on  an  infinite  canvas  is  you  're  creating  a  more  pure  expression  of  what  this  medium  is  all  about .PERIOD we  'll  go  by  this  a  little  quickly ,COMMA you  get  the  idea .PERIOD i  just  want  to  get  to  the  last  panel .PERIOD there  we  go .PERIOD just  one  more .PERIOD talk  about  your  infinite  canvas .PERIOD it  's  by  a  guy  named  daniel  merlin  goodbrey  in  britain .PERIOD why  is  this  important ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  this  is  important  because  media ,COMMA all  media ,COMMA provide  us  a  window  back  into  our  world .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  could  be  that  motion  pictures ,COMMA and  eventually ,COMMA virtual  reality ,COMMA or  something  equivalent  to  it ,COMMA some  sort  of  immersive  display ,COMMA is  going  to  provide  us  with  our  most  efficient  escape  from  the  world  that  we  're  in .PERIOD that  's  why  most  people  turn  to  storytelling ,COMMA is  to  escape .PERIOD but  media  provides  us  with  a  window  back  into  the  world  that  we  live  in .PERIOD and  when  media  evolve  so  that  the  identity  of  the  media  becomes  increasingly  unique .PERIOD because  what  you  're  looking  at  is ,COMMA you  're  looking  at  comics  cubed ,COMMA you  're  looking  at  comics  that  are  more  comics-like  than  they've  ever  been  before .PERIOD when  that  happens ,COMMA you  provide  people  with  multiple  ways  of  re-entering  the  world  through  different  windows ,COMMA and  when  you  do  that ,COMMA it  allows  them  to  triangulate  the  world  that  they  live  in  and  see  its  shape .PERIOD and  that  's  why  i  think  this  is  important .PERIOD one  of  many  reasons ,COMMA but  i've  got  to  go  now .PERIOD thank  you  for  having  me .PERIOD last  year ,COMMA i  told  you  the  story ,COMMA in  seven  minutes ,COMMA of  project  orion ,COMMA which  was  this  very  implausible  technology  that  technically  could  have  worked ,COMMA but  it  had  this  one-year  political  window  where  it  could  have  happened .PERIOD so  it  did  n't  happen .PERIOD it  was  a  dream  that  did  not  happen .PERIOD this  year  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  the  story  of  the  birth  of  digital  computing .PERIOD this  was  a  perfect  introduction .PERIOD and  it  's  a  story  that  did  work .PERIOD it  did  happen .PERIOD and  the  machines  are  all  around  us .PERIOD and  it  was  a  technology  that  was  inevitable .PERIOD if  the  people  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  the  story  about ,COMMA if  they  had  n't  done  it ,COMMA somebody  else  would  have .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  was  sort  of  the  right  idea  at  the  right  time .PERIOD this  is  barricelli  's  universe .PERIOD this  is  the  universe  we  live  in  now .PERIOD it  's  the  universe  in  which  these  machines  are  now  doing  all  these  things ,COMMA including  changing  biology .PERIOD i  'm  starting  the  story  with  the  first  atomic  bomb  at  trinity .PERIOD which  was  the  manhattan  project .PERIOD it  was  a  little  bit  like  ted ,COMMA it  brought  a  whole  lot  of  very  smart  people  together .PERIOD and  three  of  the  smartest  people  were  stan  ulam ,COMMA richard  feynman  and  john  von  neumann .PERIOD and  it  was  von  neumann  who  said ,COMMA after  the  bomb ,COMMA he  was  working  on  something  much  more  important  than  bombs: .PERIOD he  's  thinking  about  computers .PERIOD so ,COMMA he  was  n't  only  thinking  about  them .PERIOD he  built  one .PERIOD this  is  the  machine  he  built .PERIOD he  built  this  machine ,COMMA and  we  had  a  beautiful  demonstration  of  how  this  thing  really  works ,COMMA with  these  little  bits .PERIOD and  it  's  an  idea  that  goes  way  back .PERIOD the  first  person  to  really  explain  that  was  thomas  hobbes ,COMMA who ,COMMA in  1651 ,COMMA explained  how  arithmetic  and  logic  are  the  same  thing ,COMMA and  if  you  want  to  do  artificial  thinking  and  artificial  logic ,COMMA you  can  do  it  all  with  arithmetic .PERIOD he  said  you  needed  addition  and  subtraction .PERIOD leibniz ,COMMA who  came  a  little  bit  later ,COMMA this  is  1679 ,COMMA showed  that  you  did  n't  even  need  subtraction .PERIOD you  could  do  the  whole  thing  with  addition .PERIOD here ,COMMA we  have  all  the  binary  arithmetic  and  logic  that  drove  the  computer  revolution .PERIOD and  leibniz  was  the  first  person  to  really  talk  about  building  such  a  machine .PERIOD he  talked  about  doing  it  with  marbles ,COMMA having  gates  and  what  we  now  call  shift  registers ,COMMA where  you  shift  the  gates ,COMMA drop  the  marbles  down  the  tracks .PERIOD and  that  's  what  all  these  machines  are  doing ,COMMA except ,COMMA instead  of  doing  it  with  marbles ,COMMA they  're  doing  it  with  electrons .PERIOD and  then  we  jump  to  von  neumann ,COMMA 1945 ,COMMA when  he  sort  of  reinvents  the  whole  same  thing .PERIOD and  1945 ,COMMA after  the  war ,COMMA the  electronics  existed  to  actually  try  and  build  such  a  machine .PERIOD so  june  1945 ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the  bomb  has  n't  even  been  dropped  yet ,COMMA and  von  neumann  is  putting  together  all  the  theory  to  actually  build  this  thing .PERIOD which  also  goes  back  to  turing ,COMMA who ,COMMA before  that ,COMMA gave  the  idea  that  you  could  do  all  this  with  a  very  brainless ,COMMA little ,COMMA finite  state  machine ,COMMA just  reading  a  tape  in  and  reading  a  tape  out .PERIOD the  other  sort  of  genesis  of  what  von  neumann  did  was  the  difficulty  of  how  you  would  predict  the  weather .PERIOD lewis  richardson  saw  how  you  could  do  this  with  a  cellular  array  of  people ,COMMA giving  them  each  a  little  chunk ,COMMA and  putting  it  together .PERIOD here ,COMMA we  have  an  electrical  model  illustrating  a  mind  having  a  will ,COMMA but  capable  of  only  two  ideas .PERIOD and  that  's  really  the  simplest  computer .PERIOD it  's  basically  why  you  need  the  qubit ,COMMA because  it  only  has  two  ideas .PERIOD and  you  put  lots  of  those  together ,COMMA you  get  the  essentials  of  the  modern  computer ,COMMA the  arithmetic  unit ,COMMA the  central  control ,COMMA the  memory ,COMMA the  recording  medium ,COMMA the  input  and  the  output .PERIOD but ,COMMA there  's  one  catch .PERIOD this  is  the  fatal ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD we  saw  it  in  starting  these  programs  up .PERIOD the  instructions  which  govern  this  operation  must  be  given  in  absolutely  exhaustive  detail .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  programming  has  to  be  perfect ,COMMA or  it  wo  n't  work .PERIOD if  you  look  at  the  origins  of  this ,COMMA the  classic  history  sort  of  takes  it  all  back  to  the  eniac  here .PERIOD but  actually ,COMMA the  machine  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  about ,COMMA the  institute  for  advanced  study  machine ,COMMA which  is  way  up  there ,COMMA really  should  be  down  there .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  'm  trying  to  revise  history ,COMMA and  give  some  of  these  guys  more  credit  than  they've  had .PERIOD such  a  computer  would  open  up  universes ,COMMA which  are ,COMMA at  the  present ,COMMA outside  the  range  of  any  instruments .PERIOD so  it  opens  up  a  whole  new  world ,COMMA and  these  people  saw  it .PERIOD the  guy  who  was  supposed  to  build  this  machine  was  the  guy  in  the  middle ,COMMA vladimir  zworykin ,COMMA from  rca .PERIOD rca ,COMMA in  probably  one  of  the  lousiest  business  decisions  of  all  time ,COMMA decided  not  to  go  into  computers .PERIOD but  the  first  meetings ,COMMA november  1945 ,COMMA were  at  rca  's  offices .PERIOD rca  started  this  whole  thing  off ,COMMA and  said ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA televisions  are  the  future ,COMMA not  computers .PERIOD the  essentials  were  all  there ,COMMA all  the  things  that  make  these  machines  run .PERIOD von  neumann ,COMMA and  a  logician ,COMMA and  a  mathematician  from  the  army  put  this  together .PERIOD then ,COMMA they  needed  a  place  to  build  it .PERIOD when  rca  said  no ,COMMA that  's  when  they  decided  to  build  it  in  princeton ,COMMA where  freeman  works  at  the  institute .PERIOD that  's  where  i  grew  up  as  a  kid .PERIOD that  's  me ,COMMA that  's  my  sister  esther ,COMMA who  's  talked  to  you  before .PERIOD so  we  both  go  back  to  the  birth  of  this  thing .PERIOD that  's  freeman ,COMMA a  long  time  ago .PERIOD and  that  was  me .PERIOD and  this  is  von  neumann  and  morgenstern ,COMMA who  wrote  the  theory  of  games .PERIOD all  these  forces  came  together  there ,COMMA in  princeton .PERIOD oppenheimer ,COMMA who  had  built  the  bomb .PERIOD the  machine  was  actually  used  mainly  for  doing  bomb  calculations .PERIOD and  julian  bigelow ,COMMA who  took  zworkykin  's  place  as  the  engineer ,COMMA to  actually  figure  out ,COMMA using  electronics ,COMMA how  you  would  build  this  thing .PERIOD the  whole  gang  of  people  who  came  to  work  on  this ,COMMA and  women  in  front ,COMMA who  actually  did  most  of  the  coding ,COMMA were  the  first  programmers .PERIOD these  were  the  prototype  geeks ,COMMA the  nerds .PERIOD they  did  n't  fit  in  at  the  institute .PERIOD this  is  a  letter  from  the  director ,COMMA concerned  about ,COMMA especially  unfair  on  the  matter  of  sugar .PERIOD you  can  read  the  text .PERIOD this  is  hackers  getting  in  trouble  for  the  first  time .PERIOD these  were  not  theoretical  physicists .PERIOD they  were  real  soldering-gun  type  guys ,COMMA and  they  actually  built  this  thing .PERIOD and  we  take  it  for  granted  now ,COMMA that  each  of  these  machines  has  billions  of  transistors ,COMMA doing  billions  of  cycles  per  second  without  failing .PERIOD they  were  using  vacuum  tubes ,COMMA very  narrow ,COMMA sloppy  techniques  to  get  actually  binary  behavior  out  of  these  radio  vacuum  tubes .PERIOD they  actually  used  6j6 ,COMMA the  common  radio  tube ,COMMA because  they  found  they  were  more  reliable  than  the  more  expensive  tubes .PERIOD and  what  they  did  at  the  institute  was  publish  every  step  of  the  way .PERIOD reports  were  issued ,COMMA so  that  this  machine  was  cloned  at  15  other  places  around  the  world .PERIOD and  it  really  was .PERIOD it  was  the  original  microprocessor .PERIOD all  the  computers  now  are  copies  of  that  machine .PERIOD the  memory  was  in  cathode  ray  tubes ,COMMA a  whole  bunch  of  spots  on  the  face  of  the  tube ,COMMA very ,COMMA very  sensitive  to  electromagnetic  disturbances .PERIOD so ,COMMA there  's  40  of  these  tubes ,COMMA like  a  v-40  engine  running  the  memory .PERIOD the  input  and  the  output  was  by  teletype  tape  at  first .PERIOD this  is  a  wire  drive ,COMMA using  bicycle  wheels .PERIOD this  is  the  archetype  of  the  hard  disk  that  's  in  your  machine  now .PERIOD then  they  switched  to  a  magnetic  drum .PERIOD this  is  modifying  ibm  equipment ,COMMA which  is  the  origins  of  the  whole  data-processing  industry ,COMMA later  at  ibm .PERIOD and  this  is  the  beginning  of  computer  graphics .PERIOD the  graph'g-beam  turn  on  this  next  slide .PERIOD that  's  the ,COMMA as  far  as  i  know ,COMMA the  first  digital  bitmap  display ,COMMA 1954 .PERIOD so ,COMMA von  neumann  was  already  off  in  a  theoretical  cloud ,COMMA doing  abstract  sorts  of  studies  of  how  you  could  build  reliable  machines  out  of  unreliable  components .PERIOD those  guys  drinking  all  the  tea  with  sugar  in  it  were  writing  in  their  logbooks ,COMMA trying  to  get  this  thing  to  work ,COMMA with  all  these  2,600  vacuum  tubes  that  failed  half  the  time .PERIOD and  that  's  what  i've  been  doing ,COMMA this  last  six  months ,COMMA is  going  through  the  logs .PERIOD running  time ,COMMA two  minutes .PERIOD input ,COMMA output ,COMMA 90  minutes .PERIOD this  includes  a  large  amount  of  human  error .PERIOD so  they  are  always  trying  to  figure  out ,COMMA what  's  machine  error ?QUESTIONMARK what  's  human  error ?QUESTIONMARK what  's  code ,COMMA what  's  hardware ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  an  engineer  gazing  at  tube  number  36 ,COMMA trying  to  figure  out  why  the  memory  's  not  in  focus .PERIOD he  had  to  focus  the  memory ,COMMA seems  ok .PERIOD so ,COMMA he  had  to  focus  each  tube  just  to  get  the  memory  up  and  running ,COMMA let  alone  having ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA software  problems .PERIOD no  use ,COMMA went  home .PERIOD impossible  to  follow  the  damn  thing ,COMMA where  's  a  directory ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA already ,COMMA they  're  complaining  about  the  manuals ,COMMA before  closing  down  in  disgust .PERIOD the  general  arithmetic ,COMMA operating  logs  burning  lots  of  midnight  oil .PERIOD maniac ,COMMA which  became  the  acronym  for  the  machine ,COMMA mathematical  and  numerical  integrator  and  calculator ,COMMA lost  its  memory .PERIOD maniac  regained  its  memory ,COMMA when  the  power  went  off  machine  or  human ?QUESTIONMARK aha  so ,COMMA they  figured  out  it  's  a  code  problem .PERIOD found  trouble  in  code ,COMMA i  hope .PERIOD code  error ,COMMA machine  not  guilty .PERIOD damn  it ,COMMA i  can  be  just  as  stubborn  as  this  thing .PERIOD and  the  dawn  came  so  they  ran  all  night .PERIOD twenty-four  hours  a  day ,COMMA this  thing  was  running ,COMMA mainly  running  bomb  calculations .PERIOD everything  up  to  this  point  is  wasted  time  what  's  the  use ?QUESTIONMARK good  night .PERIOD master  control  off .PERIOD the  hell  with  it .PERIOD way  off .PERIOD something  's  wrong  with  the  air  conditioner ,COMMA smell  of  burning  v-belts  in  the  air .PERIOD a  short ,COMMA do  not  turn  the  machine  on .PERIOD ibm  machine  putting  a  tar-like  substance  on  the  cards .PERIOD the  tar  is  from  the  roof .PERIOD so  they  really  were  working  under  tough  conditions .PERIOD here ,COMMA a  mouse  has  climbed  into  the  blower  behind  the  regulator  rack ,COMMA set  blower  to  vibrating .PERIOD result ,COMMA no  more  mouse .PERIOD here  lies  mouse .PERIOD born ,COMMA  ?QUESTIONMARK died ,COMMA 4:50  am ,COMMA may  1953 .PERIOD there  's  an  inside  joke  someone  has  penciled  in ,COMMA here  lies  marston  mouse .PERIOD if  you  're  a  mathematician ,COMMA you  get  that .PERIOD because  marston  was  a  mathematician  who  objected  to  the  computer  being  there .PERIOD picked  a  lightning  bug  off  the  drum  running  at  two  kilocycles .PERIOD that  's  two  thousand  cycles  per  second  -- .PERIOD yes ,COMMA i  'm  chicken ,COMMA so  two  kilocycles  was  slow  speed .PERIOD the  high  speed  was  16  kilocycles .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  if  you  remember  a  mac  that  was  16  megahertz .PERIOD that  's  slow  speed .PERIOD i  have  now  duplicated  both  results .PERIOD how  will  i  know  which  is  right ,COMMA assuming  one  result  is  correct ?QUESTIONMARK this  now  is  the  third  different  output .PERIOD i  know  when  i  'm  licked .PERIOD we've  duplicated  errors  before .PERIOD machine  run ,COMMA fine .PERIOD code  is  n't .PERIOD only  happens  when  the  machine  is  running .PERIOD and  sometimes  things  are  okay .PERIOD machine  a  thing  of  beauty ,COMMA and  a  joy  forever  perfect  running .PERIOD parting  thought ,COMMA when  there  's  bigger  and  better  errors ,COMMA we  'll  have  them .PERIOD so ,COMMA nobody  was  supposed  to  know  they  were  actually  designing  bombs .PERIOD they  're  designing  hydrogen  bombs .PERIOD but  someone  in  the  logbook ,COMMA late  one  night ,COMMA finally  drew  a  bomb .PERIOD so ,COMMA that  was  the  result .PERIOD it  was  mike ,COMMA the  first  thermonuclear  bomb ,COMMA in  1952 .PERIOD that  was  designed  on  that  machine ,COMMA in  the  woods  behind  the  institute .PERIOD so  von  neumann  invited  a  whole  gang  of  weirdos  from  all  over  the  world  to  work  on  all  these  problems .PERIOD barricelli ,COMMA he  came  to  do  what  we  now  call ,COMMA really ,COMMA artificial  life ,COMMA trying  to  see  if ,COMMA in  this  artificial  universe  -- .PERIOD he  was  a  viral-geneticist ,COMMA way ,COMMA way ,COMMA way  ahead  of  his  time .PERIOD he  's  still  ahead  of  some  of  the  stuff  that  's  being  done  now .PERIOD trying  to  start  an  artificial  genetic  system  running  in  the  computer .PERIOD began ,COMMA his  universe  started  march  3 ,COMMA 53 .PERIOD so  it  's  almost  exactly ,COMMA it  's  50  years  ago  next  tuesday ,COMMA i  guess .PERIOD and  he  saw  everything  in  terms  of  -- .PERIOD he  could  read  the  binary  code  straight  off  the  machine .PERIOD he  had  a  wonderful  rapport .PERIOD other  people  could  n't  get  the  machine  running .PERIOD it  always  worked  for  him .PERIOD even  errors  were  duplicated .PERIOD dr.  barricelli  claims  machine  is  wrong ,COMMA code  is  right .PERIOD so  he  designed  this  universe ,COMMA and  ran  it .PERIOD when  the  bomb  people  went  home ,COMMA he  was  allowed  in  there .PERIOD he  would  run  that  thing  all  night  long ,COMMA running  these  things .PERIOD if  anybody  remembers  stephen  wolfram ,COMMA who  reinvented  this  stuff .PERIOD and  he  published  it .PERIOD it  was  n't  locked  up  and  disappeared .PERIOD it  was  published  in  the  literature .PERIOD if  it  's  that  easy  to  create  living  organisms ,COMMA why  not  create  a  few  yourself ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA he  decided  to  give  it  a  try ,COMMA to  start  this  artificial  biology  going  in  the  machines .PERIOD and  he  found  all  these ,COMMA sort  of  -- .PERIOD it  was  like  a  naturalist  coming  in  and  looking  at  this  tiny ,COMMA 5,000-byte  universe ,COMMA and  seeing  all  these  things  happening  that  we  see  in  the  outside  world ,COMMA in  biology .PERIOD this  is  some  of  the  generations  of  his  universe .PERIOD but  they  're  just  going  to  stay  numbers .PERIOD they  're  not  going  to  become  organisms .PERIOD they  have  to  have  something .PERIOD you  have  a  genotype  and  you  have  to  have  a  phenotype .PERIOD they  have  to  go  out  and  do  something .PERIOD and  he  started  doing  that .PERIOD started  giving  these  little  numerical  organisms  things  they  could  play  with  -- .PERIOD playing  chess  with  other  machines  and  so  on .PERIOD and  they  did  start  to  evolve .PERIOD and  he  went  around  the  country  after  that .PERIOD every  time  there  was  a  new ,COMMA fast  machine ,COMMA he  started  using  it ,COMMA and  saw  exactly  what  's  happening  now .PERIOD that  the  programs ,COMMA instead  of  being  turned  off ,COMMA when  you  quit  the  program ,COMMA you'd  keep  running  and ,COMMA basically ,COMMA all  the  sorts  of  things  like  windows  is  doing .PERIOD running  as  a  multi-cellular  organism  on  many  machines .PERIOD he  envisioned  all  that  happening .PERIOD and  he  saw  that  evolution  itself  was  an  intelligent  process .PERIOD it  was  n't  any  sort  of  creator  intelligence ,COMMA but  the  thing  itself  was  a  giant  parallel  computation  that  would  have  some  intelligence .PERIOD and  he  went  out  of  his  way  to  say  that  he  was  not  saying  this  was  lifelike ,COMMA or  a  new  kind  of  life .PERIOD it  just  was  another  version  of  the  same  thing  happening .PERIOD and  there  's  really  no  difference  between  what  he  was  doing  in  the  computer  and  what  nature  did  billions  of  years  ago .PERIOD and  could  you  do  it  again  now ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA when  i  went  into  these  archives  looking  at  this  stuff ,COMMA lo  and  behold ,COMMA the  archivist  came  up  one  day ,COMMA saying ,COMMA i  think  we  found  another  box  that  had  been  thrown  out .PERIOD and  it  was  his  universe  on  punch  cards .PERIOD so  there  it  is ,COMMA 50  years  later ,COMMA sitting  there ,COMMA sort  of  suspended  animation .PERIOD that  's  the  instructions  for  running  -- .PERIOD this  is  actually  the  source  code  for  one  of  those  universes ,COMMA with  a  note  from  the  engineers  saying  they  're  having  some  problems .PERIOD there  must  be  something  about  this  code  that  you  have  n't  explained  yet .PERIOD and  i  think  that  's  really  the  truth .PERIOD we  still  do  n't  understand  how  these  very  simple  instructions  can  lead  to  increasing  complexity .PERIOD what  's  the  dividing  line  between  when  that  is  lifelike  and  when  it  really  is  alive ?QUESTIONMARK these  cards ,COMMA now ,COMMA thanks  to  me  showing  up ,COMMA are  being  saved .PERIOD and  the  question  is ,COMMA should  we  run  them  or  not ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ,COMMA could  we  get  them  running ?QUESTIONMARK do  you  want  to  let  it  loose  on  the  internet ?QUESTIONMARK these  machines  would  think  they  -- .PERIOD these  organisms ,COMMA if  they  came  back  to  life  now ,COMMA whether  they've  died  and  gone  to  heaven ,COMMA there  's  a  universe .PERIOD my  laptop  is  10  thousand  million  times  the  size  of  the  universe  that  they  lived  in  when  barricelli  quit  the  project .PERIOD he  was  thinking  far  ahead ,COMMA to  how  this  would  really  grow  into  a  new  kind  of  life .PERIOD and  that  's  what  's  happening .PERIOD when  juan  enriquez  told  us  about  these  12  trillion  bits  being  transferred  back  and  forth ,COMMA of  all  this  genomics  data  going  to  the  proteomics  lab ,COMMA that  's  what  barricelli  imagined ,COMMA that  this  digital  code  in  these  machines  is  actually  starting  to  code ,COMMA it  already  is  coding  from  nucleic  acids .PERIOD we've  been  doing  that  since ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA since  we  started  pcr  and  synthesizing  small  strings  of  dna .PERIOD and  real  soon ,COMMA we  're  actually  going  to  be  synthesizing  the  proteins ,COMMA and ,COMMA like  steve  showed  us ,COMMA that  just  opens  an  entirely  new  world .PERIOD it  's  a  world  that  von  neumann  himself  envisioned .PERIOD this  was  published  after  he  died ,COMMA his  sort  of  unfinished  notes  on  self-reproducing  machines .PERIOD what  it  takes  to  get  the  machines  sort  of  jump-started  to  where  they  begin  to  reproduce .PERIOD it  took  really  three  people ,COMMA barricelli  had  the  concept  of  the  code  as  a  living  thing .PERIOD von  neumann  saw  how  you  could  build  the  machines  -- .PERIOD that  now ,COMMA last  count ,COMMA four  million  of  these  von  neumann  machines  is  built  every  24  hours .PERIOD and  julian  bigelow ,COMMA who  died  10  days  ago  -- .PERIOD this  is  john  markoff  's  obituary  for  him  -- .PERIOD he  was  the  important  missing  link ,COMMA the  engineer  who  came  in  and  knew  how  to  put  those  vacuum  tubes  together  and  make  it  work .PERIOD and  all  our  computers  have ,COMMA inside  them ,COMMA the  copies  of  the  architecture  that  he  had  to  just  design  one  day ,COMMA sort  of  on  pencil  and  paper .PERIOD and  we  owe  a  tremendous  credit  to  that .PERIOD and  he  explained ,COMMA in  a  very  generous  way ,COMMA the  spirit  that  brought  all  these  different  people  to  the  institute  for  advanced  study  in  the  40s  to  do  this  project ,COMMA and  make  it  freely  available  with  no  patents ,COMMA no  restrictions ,COMMA no  intellectual  property  disputes  to  the  rest  of  the  world .PERIOD that  's  the  last  entry  in  the  logbook  when  the  machine  was  shut  down ,COMMA july  1958 .PERIOD and  it  's  julian  bigelow  who  was  running  it  until  midnight  when  the  machine  was  officially  turned  off .PERIOD and  that  's  the  end .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD i  was  thinking  about  my  place  in  the  universe ,COMMA and  about  my  first  thought  about  what  infinity  might  mean ,COMMA when  i  was  a  child .PERIOD and  i  thought  that  if  time  could  reach  forwards  and  backwards  infinitely ,COMMA does  n't  that  mean  that  every  point  in  time  is  really  infinitely  small ,COMMA and  therefore  somewhat  meaningless .PERIOD so  we  do  n't  really  have  a  place  in  the  universe ,COMMA as  far  as  on  a  time  line .PERIOD but  nothing  else  does  either .PERIOD therefore  every  moment  really  is  the  most  important  moment  that  's  ever  happened ,COMMA including  this  moment  right  now .PERIOD and  so  therefore  this  music  you  're  about  to  hear  is  maybe  the  most  important  music  you

i  'm  going  to  talk  to  you  today  about  my  work  on  suspended  animation .PERIOD now ,COMMA usually  when  i  mention  suspended  animation ,COMMA people  will  flash  me  the  vulcan  sign  and  laugh .PERIOD but  now ,COMMA i  'm  not  talking  about  gorking  people  out  to  fly  to  mars  or  even  pandora ,COMMA as  much  fun  as  that  may  be .PERIOD i  'm  talking  about  the  concept  of  using  suspended  animation  to  help  people  out  in  trauma .PERIOD so  what  do  i  mean  when  i  say  suspended  animation ?QUESTIONMARK it  is  the  process  by  which  animals  de-animate ,COMMA appear  dead  and  then  can  wake  up  again  without  being  harmed .PERIOD ok ,COMMA so  here  is  the  sort  of  big  idea: .PERIOD if  you  look  out  at  nature ,COMMA you  find  that  as  you  tend  to  see  suspended  animation ,COMMA you  tend  to  see  immortality .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA what  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  about  is  a  way  to  tell  a  person  who  's  in  trauma ,COMMA find  a  way  to  de-animate  them  a  bit  so  they  're  a  little  more  immortal  when  they  have  that  heart  attack .PERIOD an  example  of  an  organism  or  two  that  happens  to  be  quite  immortal  would  be  plant  seeds  or  bacterial  spores .PERIOD these  creatures  are  some  of  the  most  immortal  life  forms  on  our  planet ,COMMA and  they  tend  to  spend  most  of  their  time  in  suspended  animation .PERIOD bacterial  spores  are  thought  now  by  scientists  to  exist  as  individual  cells  that  are  alive ,COMMA but  in  suspended  animation  for  as  long  as  250  million  years .PERIOD to  suggest  that  this  all ,COMMA sort  of ,COMMA about  little ,COMMA tiny  creatures ,COMMA i  want  to  bring  it  close  to  home .PERIOD in  the  immortal  germ  line  of  human  beings ,COMMA that  is ,COMMA the  eggs  that  sit  in  the  ovaries ,COMMA they  actually  sit  there  in  a  state  of  suspended  animation  for  up  to  50  years  in  the  life  of  each  woman .PERIOD so  then  there  's  also  my  favorite  example  of  suspended  animation .PERIOD this  is  sea-monkeys .PERIOD those  of  you  with  children ,COMMA you  know  about  them .PERIOD you  go  to  the  pet  store  or  the  toy  store ,COMMA and  you  can  buy  these  things .PERIOD you  just  open  the  bag ,COMMA and  you  just  dump  them  into  the  plastic  aquarium ,COMMA and  in  about  a  week  or  so ,COMMA you  'll  have  little  shrimps  swimming  around .PERIOD well ,COMMA i  was  n't  so  interested  in  the  swimming .PERIOD i  was  interested  in  what  was  going  on  in  the  bag ,COMMA the  bag  on  the  toy  store  shelf  where  those  shrimp  sat  in  suspended  animation  indefinitely .PERIOD so  these  ideas  of  suspended  animation  are  not  just  about  cells  and  weird ,COMMA little  organisms .PERIOD occasionally ,COMMA human  beings  are  briefly  de-animated ,COMMA and  the  stories  of  people  who  are  briefly  de-animated  that  interest  me  the  most  are  those  having  to  do  with  the  cold .PERIOD ten  years  ago ,COMMA there  was  a  skier  in  norway  that  was  trapped  in  an  icy  waterfall .PERIOD and  she  was  there  for  two  hours  before  they  extracted  her .PERIOD she  was  extremely  cold ,COMMA and  she  had  no  heartbeat  -- .PERIOD for  all  intents  and  purposes  she  was  dead ,COMMA frozen .PERIOD seven  hours  later ,COMMA still  without  a  heartbeat ,COMMA they  brought  her  back  to  life ,COMMA and  she  went  on  to  be  the  head  radiologist  in  the  hospital  that  treated  her .PERIOD a  couple  of  years  later ,COMMA so  i  get  really  excited  about  these  things ,COMMA about  a  couple  of  years  later ,COMMA there  was  a  13-month-old ,COMMA she  was  from  canada .PERIOD her  father  had  gone  out  in  the  wintertime .PERIOD he  was  working  night  shift ,COMMA and  she  followed  him  outside  in  nothing  but  a  diaper .PERIOD and  they  found  her  hours  later ,COMMA frozen ,COMMA lifeless .PERIOD and  they  brought  her  back  to  life .PERIOD there  was  a  65-year-old  woman  in  duluth ,COMMA minnesota  last  year  that  was  found  frozen  and  without  a  pulse  in  her  front  yard  one  morning  in  the  winter ,COMMA and  they  brought  her  back  to  life .PERIOD the  next  day ,COMMA she  was  doing  so  well ,COMMA they  wanted  to  run  tests  on  her .PERIOD she  got  cranky  and  just  went  home .PERIOD so ,COMMA these  are  miracles ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK these  are  truly  miraculous  things  that  happen .PERIOD doctors  have  a  saying  that ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA you  're  not  dead  until  you  're  warm  and  dead .PERIOD and  it  's  true .PERIOD it  's  true .PERIOD in  the  new  england  journal  of  medicine ,COMMA there  was  a  study  published  that  showed  that  with  appropriate  rewarming ,COMMA people  who  had  suffered  without  a  heartbeat  for  three  hours  could  be  brought  back  to  life  without  any  neurologic  problems .PERIOD that  's  over  50  percent .PERIOD so  what  i  was  trying  to  do  is  think  of  a  way  that  we  could  study  suspended  animation  to  think  about  a  way  to  reproduce ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA what  happened  to  the  skier .PERIOD well ,COMMA i  have  to  tell  you  something  very  odd ,COMMA and  that  is  that  being  exposed  to  low  oxygen  does  not  always  kill .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  this  room ,COMMA there  's  20  percent  oxygen  or  so .PERIOD and  if  we  reduce  the  oxygen  concentration ,COMMA we  will  all  be  dead .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA the  animals  we  were  working  with  in  the  lab ,COMMA these  little  garden  worms ,COMMA nematodes ,COMMA they  were  also  dead  when  we  exposed  them  to  low  oxygen .PERIOD and  here  's  the  thing  that  should  freak  you  out .PERIOD and  that  is  that ,COMMA when  we  lower  the  oxygen  concentration  further  by  100  times ,COMMA to  10  parts  per  million ,COMMA they  were  not  dead ,COMMA they  were  in  suspended  animation ,COMMA and  we  could  bring  them  back  to  life  without  any  harm .PERIOD and  this  precise  oxygen  concentration ,COMMA 10  parts  per  million ,COMMA that  caused  suspended  animation ,COMMA is  conserved .PERIOD we  can  see  it  in  a  variety  of  different  organisms .PERIOD one  of  the  creatures  we  see  it  in  is  a  fish .PERIOD and  we  can  turn  its  heartbeat  on  and  off  by  going  in  and  out  of  suspended  animation  like  you  would  a  light  switch .PERIOD so  this  was  pretty  shocking  to  me ,COMMA that  we  could  do  this .PERIOD and  so  i  was  wondering ,COMMA when  we  were  trying  to  reproduce  the  work  with  the  skier ,COMMA that  we  noticed  that ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA she  had  no  oxygen  consumption ,COMMA and  so  maybe  she  was  in  a  similar  state  of  suspended  animation .PERIOD but ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA she  was  also  extremely  cold .PERIOD so  we  wondered  what  would  happen  if  we  took  our  suspended  animals  and  exposed  them  to  the  cold .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA what  we  found  out  was  that ,COMMA if  you  take  animals  that  are  animated  like  you  and  i ,COMMA and  you  make  them  cold ,COMMA that  is ,COMMA these  were  the  garden  worms ,COMMA now  they  're  dead .PERIOD but  if  you  have  them  in  suspended  animation ,COMMA and  move  them  into  the  cold ,COMMA they  're  all  alive .PERIOD and  there  's  the  very  important  thing  there ,COMMA if  you  want  to  survive  the  cold ,COMMA you  ought  to  be  suspended .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  a  really  good  thing .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA we  were  thinking  about  that ,COMMA about  this  relationship  between  these  things ,COMMA and  thinking  about  whether  or  not  that  's  what  happened  to  the  skier .PERIOD and  so  we  wondered ,COMMA might  there  be  some  agent  that  is  in  us ,COMMA something  that  we  make  ourselves ,COMMA that  we  might  be  able  to  regulate  our  own  metabolic  flexibility  in  such  a  way  as  to  be  able  to  survive  when  we  got  extremely  cold ,COMMA and  might  otherwise  pass  away ?QUESTIONMARK i  thought  it  might  be  interesting  to  sort  of  hunt  for  such  things .PERIOD you  know ?QUESTIONMARK i  should  mention  briefly  here  that  physiology  textbooks  that  you  can  read  about  will  tell  you  that  this  is  a  kind  of  heretical  thing  to  suggest .PERIOD we  have ,COMMA from  the  time  we  are  slapped  on  the  butt  until  we  take  our  last  dying  breath ,COMMA that  's  when  we  're  newborn  to  when  we  're  dead ,COMMA we  cannot  reduce  our  metabolic  rate  below  what  's  called  a  standard ,COMMA or  basal  metabolic  rate .PERIOD but  i  knew  that  there  were  examples  of  creatures ,COMMA also  mammals ,COMMA that  do  reduce  their  metabolic  rate  such  as  ground  squirrels  and  bears .PERIOD they  reduce  their  metabolic  rate  in  the  wintertime  when  they  hibernate .PERIOD so  i  wondered ,COMMA might  we  be  able  to  find  some  agent  or  trigger  that  might  induce  such  a  state  in  us ?QUESTIONMARK and  so ,COMMA we  went  looking  for  such  things .PERIOD and  this  was  a  period  of  time  when  we  failed  tremendously .PERIOD ken  robinson  is  here .PERIOD he  talked  about  the  glories  of  failure .PERIOD well ,COMMA we  had  a  lot  of  them .PERIOD we  tried  many  different  chemicals  and  agents ,COMMA and  we  failed  over  and  over  again .PERIOD so ,COMMA one  time ,COMMA i  was  at  home  watching  television  on  the  couch  while  my  wife  was  putting  our  child  to  bed ,COMMA and  i  was  watching  a  television  show .PERIOD it  was  a  television  show ,COMMA it  was  a  nova  show  on  pbs ,COMMA about  caves  in  new  mexico .PERIOD and  this  particular  cave  was  lechuguilla ,COMMA and  this  cave  is  incredibly  toxic  to  humans .PERIOD the  researchers  had  to  suit  up  just  to  enter  it .PERIOD it  's  filled  with  this  toxic  gas ,COMMA hydrogen  sulfide .PERIOD now ,COMMA hydrogen  sulfide  is  curiously  present  in  us .PERIOD we  make  it  ourselves .PERIOD the  highest  concentration  is  in  our  brains .PERIOD yet ,COMMA it  was  used  as  a  chemical  warfare  agent  in  world  war  i .PERIOD it  's  an  extraordinarily  toxic  thing .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA in  chemical  accidents ,COMMA hydrogen  sulfide  is  known  to ,COMMA if  you  breathe  too  much  of  it ,COMMA you  collapse  to  the  ground ,COMMA you  appear  dead ,COMMA but  if  you  were  brought  out  into  room  air ,COMMA you  can  be  reanimated  without  harm ,COMMA if  they  do  that  quickly .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  thought ,COMMA wow ,COMMA i  have  to  get  some  of  this .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  's  post-9/11  america ,COMMA and  when  you  go  into  the  research  institute ,COMMA and  you  say ,COMMA hi .PERIOD i'd  like  to  buy  some  concentrated ,COMMA compressed  gas  cylinders  of  a  lethal  gas  because  i  have  these  ideas ,COMMA see ,COMMA about  wanting  to  suspend  people .PERIOD it  's  really  going  to  be  ok .PERIOD so  that  's  kind  of  a  tough  day ,COMMA but  i  said ,COMMA there  really  is  some  basis  for  thinking  why  you  might  want  to  do  this .PERIOD as  i  said ,COMMA this  agent  is  in  us ,COMMA and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA here  's  a  curious  thing ,COMMA it  binds  to  the  very  place  inside  of  your  cells  where  oxygen  binds ,COMMA and  where  you  burn  it ,COMMA and  that  you  do  this  burning  to  live .PERIOD and  so  we  thought ,COMMA like  in  a  game  of  musical  chairs ,COMMA might  we  be  able  to  give  a  person  some  hydrogen  sulfide ,COMMA and  might  it  be  able  to  occupy  that  place  like  in  a  game  of  musical  chairs  where  oxygen  might  bind ?QUESTIONMARK and  because  you  cannot  bind  the  oxygen ,COMMA maybe  you  would  n't  consume  it ,COMMA and  then  maybe  it  would  reduce  your  demand  for  oxygen .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA who  knows ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA so ,COMMA there  's  the  bit  about  the  dopamine  and  being  a  little  bit ,COMMA what  do  you  call  it ,COMMA delusional ,COMMA and  you  might  suggest  that  was  it .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA we  wanted  to  find  out  might  we  be  able  to  use  hydrogen  sulfide  in  the  presence  of  cold ,COMMA and  we  wanted  to  see  whether  we  could  reproduce  this  skier  in  a  mammal .PERIOD now ,COMMA mammals  are  warm-blooded  creatures ,COMMA and  when  we  get  cold ,COMMA we  shake  and  we  shiver ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK we  try  to  keep  our  core  temperature  at  37  degrees  by  actually  burning  more  oxygen .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  was  interesting  for  us  when  we  applied  hydrogen  sulfide  to  a  mouse  when  it  was  also  cold  because  what  happened  is  the  core  temperature  of  the  mouse  got  cold .PERIOD it  stopped  moving .PERIOD it  appeared  dead .PERIOD its  oxygen  consumption  rate  fell  by  tenfold .PERIOD and  here  's  the  really  important  point .PERIOD i  told  you  hydrogen  sulfide  is  in  us .PERIOD it  's  rapidly  metabolized ,COMMA and  all  you  have  to  do  after  six  hours  of  being  in  this  state  of  de-animation  is  simply  put  the  thing  out  in  room  air ,COMMA and  it  warms  up ,COMMA and  it  's  none  the  worse  for  wear .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  was  cosmic .PERIOD really .PERIOD because  we  had  found  a  way  to  de-animate  a  mammal .PERIOD and  it  did  n't  hurt  it .PERIOD now ,COMMA we'd  found  a  way  to  reduce  its  oxygen  consumption  to  rock-bottom  levels ,COMMA and  it  was  fine .PERIOD now ,COMMA in  this  state  of  de-animation ,COMMA it  could  not  go  out  dancing ,COMMA but  it  was  not  dead ,COMMA and  it  was  not  harmed .PERIOD so  we  started  to  think ,COMMA is  this  the  agent  that  might  have  been  present  in  the  skier ,COMMA and  might  have  she  had  more  of  it  than  someone  else ,COMMA and  might  that  have  been  able  to  reduce  her  demand  for  oxygen  before  she  got  so  cold  that  she  otherwise  would  have  died ,COMMA as  we  found  out  with  our  worm  experiments ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA we  wondered ,COMMA can  we  do  anything  useful  with  this  capacity  to  control  metabolic  flexibility ?QUESTIONMARK and  one  of  the  things  we  wondered ,COMMA i  'm  sure  some  of  you  out  there  are  economists ,COMMA and  you  know  all  about  supply  and  demand .PERIOD and  when  supply  is  equal  to  demand ,COMMA everything  's  fine ,COMMA but  when  supply  falls ,COMMA in  this  case  of  oxygen ,COMMA and  demand  stays  high ,COMMA you  're  dead .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  i  just  told  you  is  we  can  now  reduce  demand .PERIOD we  ought  to  be  able  to  lower  supply  to  unprecedented  low  levels  without  killing  the  animal .PERIOD and  with  money  we  got  from  darpa ,COMMA we  could  show  just  that .PERIOD if  you  give  mice  hydrogen  sulfide ,COMMA you  can  lower  their  demand  for  oxygen ,COMMA and  you  can  put  them  into  oxygen  concentrations  that  are  as  low  as  5,000  feet  above  the  top  of  mt .PERIOD everest ,COMMA and  they  can  sit  there  for  hours ,COMMA and  there  's  no  problem .PERIOD well  this  was  really  cool .PERIOD we  also  found  out  that  we  could  subject  animals  to  otherwise  lethal  blood  loss ,COMMA and  we  could  save  them  if  we  gave  them  hydrogen  sulfide .PERIOD so  these  proof  of  concept  experiments  led  me  to  say  i  should  found  a  company ,COMMA and  we  should  take  this  out  to  a  wider  playing  field .PERIOD i  founded  a  company  called  ikaria  with  others  help .PERIOD and  this  company ,COMMA the  first  thing  it  did  was  make  a  liquid  formulation  of  hydrogen  sulfide  and  send  it  out  to  physician  scientists  all  over  the  world  who  work  on  models  of  critical  care  medicine ,COMMA and  the  results  are  incredibly  positive .PERIOD in  one  model  of  heart  attack ,COMMA animals  given  hydrogen  sulfide  showed  a  70  percent  reduction  in  heart  damage  compared  to  those  who  got  the  standard  of  care  that  you  and  i  would  receive  if  we  were  to  have  a  heart  attack  here  today .PERIOD same  is  true  for  organ  failure ,COMMA when  you  have  loss  of  function  owing  to  poor  perfusion  of  kidney ,COMMA of  liver ,COMMA acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  and  damage  suffered  in  cardiac-bypass  surgery .PERIOD so ,COMMA these  are  the  thought  leaders  in  trauma  medicine  all  over  the  world  saying  this  is  true ,COMMA so  it  seems  that  exposure  to  hydrogen  sulfide  decreases  damage  that  you  receive  from  being  exposed  to  otherwise  lethal-low  oxygen .PERIOD and  i  should  say  that  the  concentrations  of  hydrogen  sulfide  required  to  get  this  benefit  are  low ,COMMA incredibly  low .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA so  low  that  physicians  will  not  have  to  lower  or  dim  the  metabolism  of  people  much  at  all  to  see  the  benefit  i  just  mentioned ,COMMA which  is  a  wonderful  thing ,COMMA if  you  're  thinking  about  adopting  this .PERIOD you  do  n't  want  to  be  gorking  people  out  just  to  save  them ,COMMA it  's  really  confusing .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  want  to  say  that  we  're  in  human  trials .PERIOD now ,COMMA and  so ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD the  phase  1  safety  studies  are  over ,COMMA and  we  're  doing  fine ,COMMA we  're  now  moved  on .PERIOD we  have  to  get  to  phase  2  and  phase  3 .PERIOD it  's  going  to  take  us  a  few  years .PERIOD this  has  all  moved  very  quickly ,COMMA and  the  mouse  experiments  of  hibernating  mice  happened  in  2005 .PERIOD the  first  human  studies  were  done  in  2008 ,COMMA and  we  should  know  in  a  couple  of  years  whether  it  works  or  not .PERIOD and  this  all  happened  really  quickly  because  of  a  lot  of  help  from  a  lot  of  people .PERIOD i  want  to  mention  that ,COMMA first  of  all ,COMMA my  wife ,COMMA without  whom  this  talk  and  my  work  would  not  be  possible ,COMMA so  thank  you  very  much .PERIOD also ,COMMA the  brilliant  scientists  who  work  at  my  lab  and  also  others  on  staff ,COMMA the  fred  hutchinson  cancer  research  center  in  seattle ,COMMA washington ,COMMA wonderful  place  to  work .PERIOD and  also  the  wonderful  scientists  and  businesspeople  at  ikaria .PERIOD one  thing  those  people  did  out  there  was  take  this  technology  of  hydrogen  sulfide ,COMMA which  is  this  start-up  company  that  's  burning  venture  capital  very  quickly ,COMMA and  they  fused  it  with  another  company  that  sells  another  toxic  gas  that  's  more  toxic  than  hydrogen  sulfide ,COMMA and  they  give  it  to  newborn  babies  who  would  otherwise  die  from  a  failure  to  be  able  to  oxygenate  their  tissues  properly .PERIOD and  this  gas  that  is  delivered  in  over  a  thousand  critical  care  hospitals  worldwide ,COMMA now  is  approved ,COMMA on  label ,COMMA and  saves  thousands  of  babies  a  year  from  certain  death .PERIOD so  it  's  really  incredible  for  me  to  be  a  part  of  this .PERIOD and  i  want  to  say  that  i  think  we  're  on  the  path  of  understanding  metabolic  flexibility  in  a  fundamental  way ,COMMA and  that  in  the  not  too  distant  future ,COMMA an  emt  might  give  an  injection  of  hydrogen  sulfide ,COMMA or  some  related  compound ,COMMA to  a  person  suffering  severe  injuries ,COMMA and  that  person  might  de-animate  a  bit ,COMMA they  might  become  a  little  more  immortal .PERIOD their  metabolism  will  fall  as  though  you  were  dimming  a  switch  on  a  lamp  at  home .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA they  will  have  the  time ,COMMA that  will  buy  them  the  time ,COMMA to  be  transported  to  the  hospital  to  get  the  care  they  need .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA after  they  get  that  care ,COMMA like  the  mouse ,COMMA like  the  skier ,COMMA like  the  65-year-old  woman ,COMMA they  'll  wake  up .PERIOD a  miracle ?QUESTIONMARK we  hope  not ,COMMA or  maybe  we  just  hope  to  make  miracles  a  little  more  common .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD if  you  have  n't  ordered  yet ,COMMA i  generally  find  the  rigatoni  with  the  spicy  tomato  sauce  goes  best  with  diseases  of  the  small  intestine .PERIOD so ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA it  just  feels  like  i  should  be  doing  stand-up  up  here  because  of  the  setting .PERIOD no ,COMMA what  i  want  to  do  is  take  you  back  to  1854  in  london  for  the  next  few  minutes ,COMMA and  tell  the  story ,COMMA in  brief ,COMMA of  this  outbreak ,COMMA which  in  many  ways ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA helped  create  the  world  that  we  live  in  today ,COMMA and  particularly  the  kind  of  city  that  we  live  in  today .PERIOD this  period  in  1854 ,COMMA in  the  middle  part  of  the  19th  century ,COMMA in  london  's  history ,COMMA is  incredibly  interesting  for  a  number  of  reasons .PERIOD but  i  think  the  most  important  one  is  that  london  was  this  city  of  25  million  people ,COMMA and  it  was  the  largest  city  on  the  face  of  the  planet  at  that  point .PERIOD but  it  was  also  the  largest  city  that  had  ever  been  built .PERIOD and  so  the  victorians  were  trying  to  live  through  and  simultaneously  invent  a  whole  new  scale  of  living ,COMMA this  scale  of  living  that  we ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA now  call  metropolitan  living .PERIOD and  it  was  in  many  ways ,COMMA at  this  point  in  the  mid-1850s ,COMMA a  complete  disaster .PERIOD they  were  basically  a  city  living  with  a  modern  kind  of  industrial  metropolis  with  an  elizabethan  public  infrastructure .PERIOD so  people ,COMMA for  instance ,COMMA just  to  gross  you  out  for  a  second ,COMMA had  cesspools  of  human  waste  in  their  basement .PERIOD like ,COMMA a  foot  to  two  feet  deep .PERIOD and  they  would  just  kind  of  throw  the  buckets  down  there  and  hope  that  it  would  somehow  go  away ,COMMA and  of  course  it  never  really  would  go  away .PERIOD and  all  of  this  stuff ,COMMA basically ,COMMA had  accumulated  to  the  point  where  the  city  was  incredibly  offensive  to  just  walk  around  in .PERIOD it  was  an  amazingly  smelly  city .PERIOD not  just  because  of  the  cesspools ,COMMA but  also  the  sheer  number  of  livestock  in  the  city  would  shock  people .PERIOD not  just  the  horses ,COMMA but  people  had  cows  in  their  attics  that  they  would  use  for  milk ,COMMA that  they  would  hoist  up  there  and  keep  them  in  the  attic  until  literally  their  milk  ran  out  and  they  died ,COMMA and  then  they  would  drag  them  off  to  the  bone  boilers  down  the  street .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  would  just  walk  around  london  at  this  point  and  just  be  overwhelmed  with  this  stench .PERIOD and  what  ended  up  happening  is  that  an  entire  emerging  public  health  system  became  convinced  that  it  was  the  smell  that  was  killing  everybody ,COMMA that  was  creating  these  diseases  that  would  wipe  through  the  city  every  three  or  four  years .PERIOD and  cholera  was  really  the  great  killer  of  this  period .PERIOD it  arrived  in  london  in  1832 ,COMMA and  every  four  or  five  years  another  epidemic  would  take  10,000 ,COMMA 20,000  people  in  london  and  throughout  the  uk .PERIOD and  so  the  authorities  became  convinced  that  this  smell  was  this  problem .PERIOD we  had  to  get  rid  of  the  smell .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA they  concocted  a  couple  of  early ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA founding  public-health  interventions  in  the  system  of  the  city ,COMMA one  of  which  was  called  the  nuisances  act ,COMMA which  they  got  everybody  as  far  as  they  could  to  empty  out  their  cesspools  and  just  pour  all  that  waste  into  the  river .PERIOD because  if  we  get  it  out  of  the  streets ,COMMA it  'll  smell  much  better ,COMMA and ,COMMA oh  right ,COMMA we  drink  from  the  river .PERIOD so  what  ended  up  happening ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is  they  ended  up  increasing  the  outbreaks  of  cholera  because ,COMMA as  we  now  know ,COMMA cholera  is  actually  in  the  water .PERIOD it  's  a  waterborne  disease ,COMMA not  something  that  's  in  the  air .PERIOD it  's  not  something  you  smell  or  inhale .PERIOD it  's  something  you  ingest .PERIOD and  so  one  of  the  founding  moments  of  public  health  in  the  19th  century  effectively  poisoned  the  water  supply  of  london  much  more  effectively  than  any  modern  day  bioterrorist  could  have  ever  dreamed  of  doing .PERIOD so  this  was  the  state  of  london  in  1854 ,COMMA and  in  the  middle  of  all  this  carnage  and  offensive  conditions ,COMMA and  in  the  midst  of  all  this  scientific  confusion  about  what  was  actually  killing  people .PERIOD it  was  a  very  talented  classic  19th  century  multi-disciplinarian  named  john  snow ,COMMA who  was  a  local  doctor  in  soho  in  london ,COMMA who  had  been  arguing  for  about  four  or  five  years  that  cholera  was ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA a  waterborne  disease ,COMMA and  had  basically  convinced  nobody  of  this .PERIOD the  public  health  authorities  had  largely  ignored  what  he  had  to  say .PERIOD and  he'd  made  the  case  in  a  number  of  papers  and  done  a  number  of  studies ,COMMA but  nothing  had  really  stuck .PERIOD and  part  of ,COMMA what  's  so  interesting  about  this  story  to  me  is  that  in  some  ways ,COMMA it  's  a  great  case  study  in  how  cultural  change  happens .PERIOD how  a  good  idea  eventually  comes  to  win  out  over  much  worse  ideas .PERIOD and  snow  labored  for  a  long  time  with  this  great  insight  that  everybody  ignored .PERIOD and  then  on  one  day ,COMMA august  28th  of  1854 ,COMMA a  young  child ,COMMA a  five-month-old  girl  whose  first  name  we  do  n't  know ,COMMA we  know  her  only  as  baby  lewis ,COMMA somehow  contracted  cholera .PERIOD came  down  with  cholera  at  40  broad  street .PERIOD you  cannot  really  see  it  in  this  map ,COMMA but  this  is  the  map  that  becomes  the  central  focus  in  the  second  half  of  my  book .PERIOD it  's  in  the  middle  of  soho ,COMMA in  this  working  class  neighborhood .PERIOD this  little  girl  becomes  sick  and  it  turns  out  that  the  cesspool ,COMMA that  they  still  continue  to  have ,COMMA despite  the  nuisances  act ,COMMA bordered  on  an  extremely  popular  water  pump ,COMMA local  watering  hole  that  was  well  known  for  the  best  water  in  all  of  soho ,COMMA that  all  the  residents  from  soho  and  the  surrounding  neighborhoods  would  go  to .PERIOD and  so  this  little  girl  inadvertently  ended  up  contaminating  the  water  in  this  popular  pump ,COMMA and  one  of  the  most  terrifying  outbreaks  in  the  history  of  england  erupted  about  two  or  three  days  later .PERIOD literally ,COMMA 10  percent  of  the  neighborhood  died  in  seven  days ,COMMA and  much  more  would  have  died  if  people  had  n't  fled  after  the  initial  outbreak  kicked  in .PERIOD so  it  was  this  incredibly  terrifying  event .PERIOD you  had  these  scenes  of  entire  families  dying  over  the  course  of  48  hours  of  cholera ,COMMA alone  in  their  one-room  apartments ,COMMA in  their  little  flats .PERIOD just  an  extraordinary ,COMMA terrifying  scene .PERIOD snow  lived  near  there ,COMMA heard  about  the  outbreak ,COMMA and  in  this  amazing  act  of  courage  went  directly  into  the  belly  of  the  beast  because  he  thought  an  outbreak  that  concentrated  could  actually  potentially  end  up  convincing  people  that ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA the  real  menace  of  cholera  was  in  the  water  supply  and  not  in  the  air .PERIOD he  suspected  an  outbreak  that  concentrated  would  probably  involve  a  single  point  source .PERIOD one  single  thing  that  everybody  was  going  to  because  it  did  n't  have  the  traditional  slower  path  of  infections  that  you  might  expect .PERIOD and  so  he  went  right  in  there  and  started  interviewing  people .PERIOD he  eventually  enlisted  the  help  of  this  amazing  other  figure ,COMMA who  's  kind  of  the  other  protagonist  of  the  book  -- .PERIOD this  guy ,COMMA henry  whitehead ,COMMA who  was  a  local  minister ,COMMA who  was  not  at  all  a  man  of  science ,COMMA but  was  incredibly  socially  connected .PERIOD he  knew  everybody  in  the  neighborhood .PERIOD and  he  managed  to  track  down ,COMMA whitehead  did ,COMMA many  of  the  cases  of  people  who  had  drunk  water  from  the  pump ,COMMA or  who  had  n't  drunk  water  from  the  pump .PERIOD and  eventually  snow  made  a  map  of  the  outbreak .PERIOD he  found  increasingly  that  people  who  drank  from  the  pump  were  getting  sick .PERIOD people  who  had  n't  drunk  from  the  pump  were  not  getting  sick .PERIOD and  he  thought  about  representing  that  as  a  kind  of  a  table  of  statistics  of  people  living  in  different  neighborhoods ,COMMA people  who  had  n't ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA percentages  of  people  who  had  n't ,COMMA but  eventually  he  hit  upon  the  idea  that  what  he  needed  was  something  that  you  could  see .PERIOD something  that  would  take  in  a  sense  a  higher-level  view  of  all  this  activity  that  had  been  happening  in  the  neighborhood .PERIOD and  so  he  created  this  map ,COMMA which  basically  ended  up  representing  all  the  deaths  in  the  neighborhoods  as  black  bars  at  each  address .PERIOD and  you  can  see  in  this  map ,COMMA the  pump  right  at  the  center  of  it  and  you  can  see  that  one  of  the  residences  down  the  way  had  about  15  people  dead .PERIOD and  the  map  is  actually  a  little  bit  bigger .PERIOD as  you  get  further  and  further  away  from  the  pump ,COMMA the  deaths  begin  to  grow  less  and  less  frequent .PERIOD and  so  you  can  see  this  something  poisonous  emanating  out  of  this  pump  that  you  could  see  in  a  glance .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA with  the  help  of  this  map ,COMMA and  with  the  help  of  more  evangelizing  that  he  did  over  the  next  few  years  and  that  whitehead  did ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA actually ,COMMA the  authorities  slowly  started  to  come  around .PERIOD it  took  much  longer  than  sometimes  we  like  to  think  in  this  story ,COMMA but  by  1866 ,COMMA when  the  next  big  cholera  outbreak  came  to  london ,COMMA the  authorities  had  been  convinced ,COMMA in  part  because  of  this  story ,COMMA in  part  because  of  this  map ,COMMA that  in  fact  the  water  was  the  problem .PERIOD and  they  had  already  started  building  the  sewers  in  london ,COMMA and  they  immediately  went  to  this  outbreak  and  they  told  everybody  to  start  boiling  their  water .PERIOD and  that  was  the  last  time  that  london  has  seen  a  cholera  outbreak  since .PERIOD so ,COMMA part  of  this  story ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA well ,COMMA it  's  a  terrifying  story ,COMMA it  's  a  very  dark  story  and  it  's  a  story  that  continues  on  in  many  of  the  developing  cities  of  the  world .PERIOD it  's  also  a  story  really  that  is  fundamentally  optimistic ,COMMA which  is  to  say  that  it  's  possible  to  solve  these  problems  if  we  listen  to  reason ,COMMA if  we  listen  to  the  kind  of  wisdom  of  these  kinds  of  maps ,COMMA if  we  listen  to  people  like  snow  and  whitehead ,COMMA if  we  listen  to  the  locals  who  understand  what  's  going  on  in  these  kinds  of  situations .PERIOD and  what  it  ended  up  doing  is  making  the  idea  of  large-scale  metropolitan  living  a  sustainable  one .PERIOD when  people  were  looking  at  10  percent  of  their  neighborhoods  dying  in  the  space  of  seven  days ,COMMA there  was  a  widespread  consensus  that  this  could  n't  go  on ,COMMA that  people  were  n't  meant  to  live  in  cities  of  25  million  people .PERIOD but  because  of  what  snow  did ,COMMA because  of  this  map ,COMMA because  of  the  whole  series  of  reforms  that  happened  in  the  wake  of  this  map ,COMMA we  now  take  for  granted  that  cities  have  10  million  people .PERIOD cities  like  this  one  are  in  fact  sustainable  things .PERIOD we  do  n't  worry  that  new  york  city  is  going  to  collapse  in  on  itself  quite  the  way  that ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA rome  did ,COMMA and  be  10  percent  of  its  size  in  100  years  or  200  years .PERIOD and  so  that  in  a  way  is  the  ultimate  legacy  of  this  map .PERIOD it  's  a  map  of  deaths  that  ended  up  creating  a  whole  new  way  of  life ,COMMA the  life  that  we  're  enjoying  here  today .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD unless  we  do  something  to  prevent  it ,COMMA over  the  next  40  years  we're  facing  an  epidemic  of  neurologic  diseases  on  a  global  scale .PERIOD a  cheery  thought .PERIOD on  this  map ,COMMA every  country  that's  colored  blue  has  more  than  20  percent  of  its  population  over  the  age  of  65 .PERIOD this  is  the  world  we  live  in .PERIOD and  this  is  the  world  your  children  will  live  in .PERIOD for  12,000  years ,COMMA the  distribution  of  ages  in  the  human  population  has  looked  like  a  pyramid ,COMMA with  the  oldest  on  top .PERIOD it's  already  flattening  out .PERIOD by  2050 ,COMMA it's  going  to  be  a  column  and  will  start  to  invert .PERIOD this  is  why  it's  happening .PERIOD the  average  lifespan's  more  than  doubled  since  1840 ,COMMA and  it's  increasing  currently  at  the  rate  of  about  five  hours  every  day .PERIOD and  this  is  why  that's  not  entirely  a  good  thing ,COMMA because  over  the  age  of  65 ,COMMA your  risk  of  getting  alzheimer's  or  parkinson's  disease  will  increase  exponentially .PERIOD by  2050 ,COMMA there'll  be  about  32  million  people  in  the  united  states  over  the  age  of  80 ,COMMA and  unless  we  do  something  about  it ,COMMA half  of  them  will  have  alzheimer's  disease  and  three  million  more  will  have  parkinson's  disease .PERIOD right  now ,COMMA those  and  other  neurologic  diseases ,COMMA for  which  we  have  no  cure  or  prevention ,COMMA cost  about  a  third  of  a  trillion  dollars  a  year .PERIOD it  will  be  well  over  a  trillion  dollars  by  2050 .PERIOD alzheimer's  disease  starts  when  a  protein  that  should  be  folded  up  properly  misfolds  into  a  kind  of  demented  origami .PERIOD so  one  approach  we're  taking  is  to  try  to  design  drugs  that  function  like  molecular  scotch  tape ,COMMA to  hold  the  protein  into  its  proper  shape .PERIOD that  would  keep  it  from  forming  the  tangles  that  seem  to  kill  large  sections  of  the  brain  when  they  do .PERIOD interestingly  enough ,COMMA other  neurologic  diseases  which  affect  very  different  parts  of  the  brain  also  show  tangles  of  misfolded  protein ,COMMA which  suggests  that  the  approach  might  be  a  general  one ,COMMA and  might  be  used  to  cure  many  neurologic  diseases ,COMMA not  just  alzheimer's  disease .PERIOD there's  also  a  fascinating  connection  to  cancer  here ,COMMA because  people  with  neurologic  diseases  have  a  very  low  incidence  of  most  cancers .PERIOD and  this  is  a  connection  that  most  people  aren't  pursuing  right  now ,COMMA but  which  we're  fascinated  by .PERIOD most  of  the  important  and  all  of  the  creative  work  in  this  area  is  being  funded  by  private  philanthropies .PERIOD and  there's  tremendous  scope  for  additional  private  help  here ,COMMA because  the  government  has  dropped  the  ball  on  much  of  this ,COMMA i'm  afraid .PERIOD in  the  meantime ,COMMA while  we're  waiting  for  all  these  things  to  happen ,COMMA here's  what  you  can  do  for  yourself .PERIOD if  you  want  to  lower  your  risk  of  parkinson's  disease ,COMMA caffeine  is  protective  to  some  extent .PERIOD nobody  knows  why .PERIOD head  injuries  are  bad  for  you .PERIOD they  lead  to  parkinson's  disease .PERIOD and  the  avian  flu  is  also  not  a  good  idea .PERIOD as  far  as  protecting  yourself  against  alzheimer's  disease ,COMMA well ,COMMA it  turns  out  that  fish  oil  has  the  effect  of  reducing  your  risk  for  alzheimer's  disease .PERIOD you  should  also  keep  your  blood  pressure  down ,COMMA because  chronic  high  blood  pressure  is  the  biggest  single  risk  factor  for  alzheimer's  disease .PERIOD it's  also  the  biggest  risk  factor  for  glaucoma ,COMMA which  is  just  alzheimer's  disease  of  the  eye .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA when  it  comes  to  cognitive  effects ,COMMA use  it  or  lose  it  applies ,COMMA so  you  want  to  stay  mentally  stimulated .PERIOD but  hey ,COMMA you're  listening  to  me .PERIOD so  you've  got  that  covered .PERIOD and  one  final  thing .PERIOD wish  people  like  me  luck ,COMMA okay ?QUESTIONMARK because  the  clock  is  ticking  for  all  of  us .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD we  look  around  the  media ,COMMA as  we  see  on  the  news  from  iraq ,COMMA afghanistan ,COMMA sierra  leone ,COMMA and  the  conflict  seems  incomprehensible  to  us .PERIOD and  that  's  certainly  how  it  seemed  to  me  when  i  started  this  project .PERIOD but  as  a  physicist ,COMMA i  thought ,COMMA well  if  you  give  me  some  data ,COMMA i  could  maybe  understand  this .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA give  us  a  go .PERIOD so  as  a  naive  new  zealander  i  thought ,COMMA well  i  'll  go  to  the  pentagon .PERIOD can  you  get  me  some  information ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD so  i  had  to  think  a  little  harder .PERIOD and  i  was  watching  the  news  one  night  in  oxford .PERIOD and  i  looked  down  at  the  chattering  heads  on  my  channel  of  choice .PERIOD and  i  saw  that  there  was  information  there .PERIOD there  was  data  within  the  streams  of  news  that  we  consume .PERIOD all  this  noise  around  us  actually  has  information .PERIOD so  what  i  started  thinking  was ,COMMA perhaps  there  is  something  like  open  source  intelligence  here .PERIOD if  we  can  get  enough  of  these  streams  of  information  together ,COMMA we  can  perhaps  start  to  understand  the  war .PERIOD so  this  is  exactly  what  i  did .PERIOD we  started  bringing  a  team  together ,COMMA an  interdisciplinary  team  of  scientists ,COMMA of  economists ,COMMA mathematicians .PERIOD we  brought  these  guys  together  and  we  started  to  try  and  solve  this .PERIOD we  did  it  in  three  steps .PERIOD the  first  step  we  did  was  to  collect .PERIOD we  did  130  different  sources  of  information ,COMMA from  ngo  reports  to  newspapers  and  cable  news .PERIOD we  brought  this  raw  data  in  and  we  filtered  it .PERIOD we  extracted  the  key  bits  on  information  to  build  the  database .PERIOD that  database  contained  the  timing  of  attacks ,COMMA the  location ,COMMA the  size  and  the  weapons  used .PERIOD it  's  all  in  the  streams  of  information  we  consume  daily ,COMMA we  just  have  to  know  how  to  pull  it  out .PERIOD and  once  we  had  this  we  could  start  doing  some  cool  stuff .PERIOD what  if  we  were  to  look  at  the  distribution  of  the  sizes  of  attacks ?QUESTIONMARK what  would  that  tell  us ?QUESTIONMARK so  we  started  doing  this .PERIOD and  you  can  see  here  on  the  horizontal  axis  you've  got  the  number  of  people  killed  in  an  attack  or  the  size  of  the  attack .PERIOD and  on  the  vertical  axis  you've  got  the  number  of  attacks .PERIOD so  we  plot  data  for  sample  on  this .PERIOD you  see  some  sort  of  random  distribution ,COMMA perhaps  67  attacks ,COMMA one  person  was  killed ,COMMA or  47  attacks  where  seven  people  were  killed .PERIOD we  did  this  exact  same  thing  for  iraq .PERIOD and  we  did  n't  know ,COMMA for  iraq  what  we  were  going  to  find .PERIOD it  turns  out  what  we  found  was  pretty  surprising .PERIOD you  take  all  of  the  conflict ,COMMA all  of  the  chaos ,COMMA all  of  the  noise ,COMMA and  out  of  that  comes  this  precise  mathematical  distribution  of  the  way  attacks  are  ordered  in  this  conflict .PERIOD this  blew  our  mind .PERIOD why  should  a  conflict  like  iraq  have  this  as  its  fundamental  signature ?QUESTIONMARK why  should  there  be  order  in  war ?QUESTIONMARK we  did  n't  really  understand  that .PERIOD we  thought  maybe  there  is  something  special  about  iraq .PERIOD so  we  looked  at  a  few  more  conflicts .PERIOD we  looked  at  colombia ,COMMA we  looked  at  afghanistan ,COMMA and  we  looked  at  senegal .PERIOD and  the  same  pattern  emerged  in  each  conflict .PERIOD this  was  n't  supposed  to  happen .PERIOD these  are  different  wars ,COMMA with  different  religious  factions ,COMMA different  political  factions ,COMMA and  different  socioeconomic  problems .PERIOD and  yet  the  fundamental  patterns  underlying  them  are  the  same .PERIOD so  we  went  a  little  wider .PERIOD we  looked  around  the  world  at  all  the  data  we  could  get  our  hands  on .PERIOD from  peru  to  indonesia ,COMMA we  studied  this  same  pattern  again .PERIOD and  we  found  that  not  only  were  the  distributions  these  straight  lines ,COMMA but  the  slope  of  these  lines ,COMMA they  clustered  around  this  value  of  alpha  equals  25 .PERIOD and  we  could  generate  an  equation  that  could  predict  the  likelihood  of  an  attack .PERIOD what  we  're  saying  here  is  the  probability  of  an  attack  killing  x  number  of  people  in  a  country  like  iraq  is  equal  to  a  constant ,COMMA times  the  size  of  that  attack ,COMMA raised  to  the  power  of  negative  alpha .PERIOD and  negative  alpha  is  the  slope  of  that  line  i  showed  you  before .PERIOD so  what ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  data ,COMMA statistics .PERIOD what  does  it  tell  us  about  these  conflicts ?QUESTIONMARK that  was  a  challenge  we  had  to  face  as  physicists .PERIOD how  do  we  explain  this ?QUESTIONMARK and  what  we  really  found  was  that  alpha ,COMMA if  we  think  about  it ,COMMA is  the  organizational  structure  of  the  insurgency .PERIOD alpha  is  the  distribution  of  the  sizes  of  attacks ,COMMA which  is  really  the  distribution  of  the  group  strength  carrying  out  the  attacks .PERIOD so  we  look  at  a  process  of  group  dynamics ,COMMA coalescence  and  fragmentation .PERIOD groups  coming  together ,COMMA groups  breaking  apart .PERIOD and  we  start  running  the  numbers  on  this .PERIOD can  we  simulate  it ?QUESTIONMARK can  we  create  the  kind  of  patterns  that  we  're  seeing  in  places  like  iraq ?QUESTIONMARK turns  out  we  kind  of  do  a  reasonable  job .PERIOD we  can  run  these  simulations .PERIOD we  can  recreate  this  using  a  process  of  group  dynamics  to  explain  the  patterns  that  we  see  all  around  the  conflicts  around  the  world .PERIOD so  what  's  going  on ?QUESTIONMARK why  should  these  different ,COMMA seemingly  different  conflicts  have  the  same  patterns ?QUESTIONMARK now  what  i  believe  is  going  on  is  that  the  insurgent  forces ,COMMA they  evolve  over  time .PERIOD they  adapt .PERIOD and  it  turns  out  there  is  only  one  solution  to  fight  a  much  stronger  enemy .PERIOD and  if  you  do  n't  find  that  solution  as  an  insurgent  force ,COMMA you  do  n't  exist .PERIOD so  every  insurgent  force  that  is  ongoing ,COMMA every  conflict  that  is  ongoing ,COMMA it  's  going  to  look  something  like  this .PERIOD and  that  is  what  we  think  is  happening .PERIOD taking  it  forward ,COMMA how  do  we  change  it ?QUESTIONMARK how  do  we  end  a  war  like  iraq ?QUESTIONMARK what  does  it  look  like ?QUESTIONMARK alpha  is  the  structure .PERIOD it  's  got  a  stable  state  at  25 .PERIOD this  is  what  wars  look  like  when  they  continue .PERIOD we've  got  to  change  that .PERIOD we  can  push  it  up: .PERIOD the  forces  become  more  fragmented .PERIOD there  is  more  of  them ,COMMA but  they  are  weaker .PERIOD or  we  push  it  down: .PERIOD they  're  more  robust .PERIOD there  is  less  groups .PERIOD but  perhaps  you  can  sit  and  talk  to  them .PERIOD so  this  graph  here ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  show  you  now .PERIOD no  one  has  seen  this  before .PERIOD this  is  literally  stuff  that  we've  come  through  last  week .PERIOD and  we  see  the  evolution  of  alpha  through  time .PERIOD we  see  it  start .PERIOD and  we  see  it  grow  up  to  the  stable  state  the  wars  around  the  world  look  like .PERIOD and  it  stays  there  through  the  invasion  of  fallujah  until  the  samarra  bombings  in  the  iraqi  elections  of  06 .PERIOD and  the  system  gets  perturbed .PERIOD it  moves  upwards  to  a  fragmented  state .PERIOD this  is  when  the  surge  happens .PERIOD and  depending  on  who  you  ask ,COMMA the  surge  was  supposed  to  push  it  up  even  further .PERIOD the  opposite  happened .PERIOD the  groups  became  stronger .PERIOD they  became  more  robust .PERIOD and  so  i  'm  thinking ,COMMA right ,COMMA great ,COMMA it  's  going  to  keep  going  down .PERIOD we  can  talk  to  them .PERIOD we  can  get  a  solution .PERIOD the  opposite  happened .PERIOD it  's  moved  up  again .PERIOD the  groups  are  more  fragmented .PERIOD and  this  tells  me  one  of  two  things .PERIOD either  we  're  back  where  we  started  and  the  surge  has  had  no  effect .PERIOD or  finally  the  groups  have  been  fragmented  to  the  extent  that  we  can  start  to  think  about  maybe  moving  out .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  what  the  answer  is  to  that .PERIOD but  i  know  that  we  should  be  looking  at  the  structure  of  the  insurgency  to  answer  that  question .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD thank  you  for  putting  up  these  pictures  of  my  colleagues  over  here .PERIOD we  'll  be  talking  about  them .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  'm  going  try  an  experiment .PERIOD i  do  n't  do  experiments ,COMMA normally .PERIOD i  'm  a  theorist .PERIOD but  i  'm  going  see  what  happens  if  i  press  this  button .PERIOD sure  enough .PERIOD ok .PERIOD i  used  to  work  in  this  field  of  elementary  particles .PERIOD what  happens  to  matter  if  you  chop  it  up  very  fine ?QUESTIONMARK what  is  it  made  of ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  laws  of  these  particles  are  valid  throughout  the  universe ,COMMA and  they  're  very  much  connected  with  the  history  of  the  universe .PERIOD we  know  a  lot  about  four  forces .PERIOD there  must  be  a  lot  more ,COMMA but  those  are  at  very ,COMMA very  small  distances ,COMMA and  we  have  n't  really  interacted  with  them  very  much  yet .PERIOD the  main  thing  i  want  to  talk  about  is  this ,COMMA that  we  have  this  remarkable  experience  in  this  field  of  fundamental  physics  that  beauty  is  a  very  successful  criterion  for  choosing  the  right  theory .PERIOD and  why  on  earth  could  that  be  so ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA here  's  an  example  from  my  own  experience .PERIOD it  's  fairly  dramatic ,COMMA actually ,COMMA to  have  this  happen .PERIOD three  or  four  of  us ,COMMA in  1957 ,COMMA put  forward  a  partially  complete  theory  of  one  of  these  forces ,COMMA this  weak  force .PERIOD and  it  was  in  disagreement  with  seven ,COMMA seven ,COMMA count  them ,COMMA seven  experiments .PERIOD experiments  were  all  wrong .PERIOD and  we  published  before  knowing  that ,COMMA because  we  figured  it  was  so  beautiful ,COMMA it  's  gotta  be  right .PERIOD the  experiments  had  to  be  wrong ,COMMA and  they  were .PERIOD now  our  friend  over  there ,COMMA albert  einstein ,COMMA used  to  pay  very  little  attention  when  people  said ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA there  's  a  man  with  an  experiment  that  seems  to  disagree  with  special  relativity .PERIOD dc  miller .PERIOD what  about  that  and  he  would  say ,COMMA aw ,COMMA that  'll  go  away  now ,COMMA why  does  stuff  like  that  work ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  the  question .PERIOD now ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA what  do  we  mean  by  beautiful ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  one  thing .PERIOD i  'll  try  to  make  that  clear ,COMMA partially  clear .PERIOD why  should  it  work ,COMMA and  is  this  something  to  do  with  human  beings ?QUESTIONMARK i  'll  let  you  in  on  the  answer  to  the  last  one  that  i  offer .PERIOD and  that  is ,COMMA it  has  nothing  to  do  with  human  beings .PERIOD somewhere  in  some  other  planet ,COMMA orbiting  some  very  distant  star ,COMMA maybe  in  a  another  galaxy ,COMMA there  could  well  be  entities  that  are  at  least  as  intelligent  as  we  are ,COMMA and  are  interested  in  science .PERIOD it  's  not  impossible .PERIOD i  think  there  probably  are  lots .PERIOD very  likely ,COMMA none  is  close  enough  to  interact  with  us .PERIOD but  they  could  be  out  there ,COMMA very  easily .PERIOD and  suppose  they  have ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA very  different  sensory  apparatus ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD they  have  seven  tentacles ,COMMA and  they  have  14  little  funny-looking  compound  eyes ,COMMA and  a  brain  shaped  like  a  pretzel .PERIOD would  they  really  have  different  laws ?QUESTIONMARK there  are  lots  of  people  who  believe  that ,COMMA and  i  think  it  is  utter  baloney .PERIOD i  think  there  are  laws  out  there ,COMMA and  we  of  course  do  n't  understand  them  at  any  given  time  very  well ,COMMA but  we  try .PERIOD and  we  try  to  get  closer  and  closer .PERIOD and  someday ,COMMA we  may  actually  figure  out  the  fundamental  unified  theory  of  the  particles  and  forces ,COMMA what  i  call  the  fundamental  law  we  may  not  even  be  terribly  far  from  it .PERIOD but  even  if  we  do  n't  run  across  it  in  our  lifetimes ,COMMA we  can  still  think  there  is  one  out  there ,COMMA and  we  're  just  trying  to  get  closer  and  closer  to  it .PERIOD i  think  that  's  the  main  point  to  be  made .PERIOD we  express  these  things  mathematically .PERIOD and  when  the  mathematics  is  very  simple ,COMMA when  in  terms  of  some  mathematical  notation ,COMMA you  can  write  the  theory  in  a  very  brief  space ,COMMA without  a  lot  of  complication ,COMMA that  's  essentially  what  we  mean  by  beauty  or  elegance .PERIOD here  's  what  i  was  saying  about  the  laws .PERIOD they  're  really  there .PERIOD newton  certainly  believed  that .PERIOD and  he  said ,COMMA here ,COMMA it  is  the  business  of  natural  philosophy  to  find  out  those  laws  the  basic  law ,COMMA let  's  say ,COMMA here  's  an  assumption .PERIOD the  assumption  is  that  the  basic  law  really  takes  the  form  of  a  unified  theory  of  all  the  particles .PERIOD now ,COMMA some  people  call  that  a  theory  of  everything .PERIOD that  's  wrong  because  the  theory  is  quantum  mechanical .PERIOD and  i  wo  n't  go  into  a  lot  of  stuff  about  quantum  mechanics  and  what  it  's  like ,COMMA and  so  on .PERIOD you've  heard  a  lot  of  wrong  things  about  it  anyway .PERIOD there  are  even  movies  about  it  with  a  lot  of  wrong  stuff .PERIOD but  the  main  thing  here  is  that  it  predicts  probabilities .PERIOD now ,COMMA sometimes  those  probabilities  are  near  certainties .PERIOD and  in  a  lot  of  familiar  cases ,COMMA they  of  course  are .PERIOD but  other  times  they  're  not ,COMMA and  you  have  only  probabilities  for  different  outcomes .PERIOD so  what  that  means  is  that  the  history  of  the  universe  is  not  determined  just  by  the  fundamental  law .PERIOD it  's  the  fundamental  law  and  this  incredibly  long  series  of  accidents ,COMMA or  chance  outcomes ,COMMA that  are  there  in  addition .PERIOD and  the  fundamental  theory  does  n't  include  those  chance  outcomes .PERIOD they  are  in  addition .PERIOD so  it  's  not  a  theory  of  everything .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA a  huge  amount  of  the  information  in  the  universe  around  us  comes  from  those  accidents ,COMMA and  not  just  from  the  fundamental  laws .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  's  often  said  that  getting  closer  and  closer  to  the  fundamental  laws  by  examining  phenomena  at  low  energies ,COMMA and  then  higher  energies ,COMMA and  then  higher  energies ,COMMA or  short  distances ,COMMA and  then  shorter  distances ,COMMA and  then  still  shorter  distances ,COMMA and  so  on ,COMMA is  like  peeling  the  skin  of  an  onion .PERIOD and  we  keep  doing  that ,COMMA and  build  more  powerful  machines ,COMMA accelerators  for  particles .PERIOD we  look  deeper  and  deeper  into  the  structure  of  particles ,COMMA and  in  that  way  we  get  probably  closer  and  closer  to  this  fundamental  law .PERIOD now ,COMMA what  happens  is  that  as  we  do  that ,COMMA as  we  peel  these  skins  of  the  onion ,COMMA and  we  get  closer  and  closer  to  the  underlying  law ,COMMA we  see  that  each  skin  has  something  in  common  with  the  previous  one ,COMMA and  with  the  next  one .PERIOD we  write  them  out  mathematically ,COMMA and  we  see  they  use  very  similar  mathematics .PERIOD they  require  very  similar  mathematics .PERIOD that  is  absolutely  remarkable ,COMMA and  that  is  a  central  feature  of  what  i  'm  trying  to  say  today .PERIOD newton  called  it ,COMMA that  's  newton ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA that  one .PERIOD this  one  is  albert  einstein .PERIOD hi ,COMMA al .PERIOD and  anyway ,COMMA he  said ,COMMA nature  conformable  to  herself ,COMMA personifying  nature  as  a  female .PERIOD and  so  what  happens  is  that  the  new  phenomena ,COMMA the  new  skins ,COMMA the  inner  skins  of  the  slightly  smaller  skins  of  the  onion  that  we  get  to ,COMMA resemble  the  slightly  larger  ones .PERIOD and  the  kind  of  mathematics  that  we  had  for  the  previous  skin  is  almost  the  same  as  what  we  need  for  the  next  skin .PERIOD and  that  's  why  the  equations  look  so  simple .PERIOD because  they  use  mathematics  we  already  have .PERIOD a  trivial  example  is  this ,COMMA newton  found  the  law  of  gravity ,COMMA which  goes  like  one  over  the  square  of  the  distance  between  the  things  gravitated .PERIOD coulomb ,COMMA in  france ,COMMA found  the  same  law  for  electric  charges .PERIOD here  's  an  example  of  this  similarity .PERIOD you  look  at  gravity ,COMMA you  see  a  certain  law .PERIOD then  you  look  at  electricity .PERIOD sure  enough .PERIOD the  same  rule .PERIOD it  's  a  very  simple  example .PERIOD there  are  lots  of  more  sophisticated  examples .PERIOD symmetry  is  very  important  in  this  discussion .PERIOD you  know  what  it  means .PERIOD a  circle ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA is  symmetric  under  rotations  about  the  center  of  the  circle .PERIOD you  rotate  around  the  center  of  the  circle ,COMMA the  circle  remains  unchanged .PERIOD you  take  a  sphere ,COMMA in  three  dimensions ,COMMA you  rotate  around  the  center  of  the  sphere ,COMMA and  all  those  rotations  leave  the  sphere  alone .PERIOD they  are  symmetries  of  the  sphere .PERIOD so  we  say ,COMMA in  general ,COMMA that  there  's  a  symmetry  under  certain  operations  if  those  operations  leave  the  phenomenon ,COMMA or  its  description ,COMMA unchanged .PERIOD maxwell  's  equations  are  of  course  symmetrical  under  rotations  of  all  of  space .PERIOD does  n't  matter  if  we  turn  the  whole  of  space  around  by  some  angle ,COMMA it  does  n't  leave  the ,COMMA does  n't  change  the  phenomenon  of  electricity  or  magnetism .PERIOD there  's  a  new  notation  in  the  19th  century  that  expressed  this ,COMMA and  if  you  use  that  notation ,COMMA the  equations  get  a  lot  simpler .PERIOD then  einstein ,COMMA with  his  special  theory  of  relativity ,COMMA looked  at  a  whole  set  of  symmetries  of  maxwell  's  equations ,COMMA which  are  called  special  relativity .PERIOD and  those  symmetries ,COMMA then ,COMMA make  the  equations  even  shorter ,COMMA and  even  prettier ,COMMA therefore .PERIOD let  's  look .PERIOD you  do  n't  have  to  know  what  these  things  mean ,COMMA does  n't  make  any  difference .PERIOD but  you  can  just  look  at  the  form .PERIOD you  can  look  at  the  form .PERIOD you  see  above ,COMMA at  the  top ,COMMA a  long  list  of  equations  with  three  components  for  the  three  directions  of  space ,COMMA x ,COMMA y  and  z .PERIOD then ,COMMA using  vector  analysis ,COMMA you  use  rotational  symmetry ,COMMA and  you  get  this  next  set .PERIOD then  you  use  the  symmetry  of  special  relativity  and  you  get  an  even  simpler  set  down  here ,COMMA showing  that  symmetry  exhibits  better  and  better .PERIOD the  more  and  more  symmetry  you  have ,COMMA the  better  you  exhibit  the  simplicity  and  elegance  of  the  theory .PERIOD the  last  two ,COMMA the  first  equation  says  that  electric  charges  and  currents  give  rise  to  all  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields .PERIOD the  next ,COMMA second ,COMMA equation  says  that  there  is  no  magnetism  other  than  that .PERIOD the  only  magnetism  comes  from  electric  charges  and  currents .PERIOD someday  we  may  find  some  slight  hole  in  that  argument .PERIOD but  for  the  moment ,COMMA that  's  the  case .PERIOD now ,COMMA here  is  a  very  exciting  development  that  many  people  have  not  heard  of .PERIOD they  should  have  heard  of  it ,COMMA but  it  's  a  little  tricky  to  explain  in  technical  detail ,COMMA so  i  wo  n't  do  it .PERIOD i  'll  just  mention  it .PERIOD but  chen  ning  yang ,COMMA called  by  us  frank  yang ,COMMA and  bob  mills  put  forward ,COMMA 50  years  ago ,COMMA this  generalization  of  maxwell  's  equations ,COMMA with  a  new  symmetry .PERIOD a  whole  new  symmetry .PERIOD mathematics  very  similar ,COMMA but  there  was  a  whole  new  symmetry .PERIOD they  hoped  that  this  would  contribute  somehow  to  particle  physics ,COMMA did  n't .PERIOD it  did  n't ,COMMA by  itself ,COMMA contribute  to  particle  physics .PERIOD but  then  some  of  us  generalized  it  further .PERIOD and  then  it  did .PERIOD and  it  gave  a  very  beautiful  description  of  the  strong  force  and  of  the  weak  force .PERIOD so  here  we  say ,COMMA again ,COMMA what  we  said  before ,COMMA that  each  skin  of  the  onion  shows  a  similarity  to  the  adjoining  skins .PERIOD so  the  mathematics  for  the  adjoining  skins  is  very  similar  to  what  we  need  for  the  new  one .PERIOD and  therefore  it  looks  beautiful .PERIOD because  we  already  know  how  to  write  it  in  a  lovely ,COMMA concise  way .PERIOD so  here  are  the  themes .PERIOD we  believe  there  is  a  unified  theory  underlying  all  the  regularities .PERIOD steps  toward  unification  exhibit  the  simplicity .PERIOD symmetry  exhibits  the  simplicity .PERIOD and  then  there  is  self-similarity  across  the  scales ,COMMA in  other  words ,COMMA from  one  skin  of  the  onion  to  another  one .PERIOD proximate  self-similarity .PERIOD and  that  accounts  for  this  phenomenon .PERIOD that  will  account  for  why  beauty  is  a  successful  criterion  for  selecting  the  right  theory .PERIOD here  's  what  newton  himself  said ,COMMA nature  is  very  consonant  and  conformable  to  her  self  one  thing  he  was  thinking  of  is  something  that  most  of  us  take  for  granted  today ,COMMA but  in  his  day  it  was  n't  taken  for  granted .PERIOD there  's  the  story ,COMMA which  is  not  absolutely  certain  to  be  right ,COMMA but  a  lot  of  people  told  it .PERIOD four  sources  told  it .PERIOD that  when  they  had  the  plague  in  cambridge ,COMMA and  he  went  down  to  his  mother  's  farm ,COMMA because  the  university  was  closed ,COMMA he  saw  an  apple  fall  from  a  tree ,COMMA or  on  his  head  or  something .PERIOD and  he  realized  suddenly  that  the  force  that  drew  the  apple  down  to  the  earth  could  be  the  same  as  the  force  regulating  the  motions  of  the  planets  and  the  moon .PERIOD that  was  a  big  unification  for  those  days ,COMMA although  today  we  take  it  for  granted .PERIOD it  's  the  same  theory  of  gravity .PERIOD so  he  said  that  this  principle  of  nature ,COMMA consonance ,COMMA this  principle  of  nature  being  very  remote  from  the  conceptions  of  philosophers ,COMMA i  forbore  to  describe  it  in  that  book ,COMMA lest  i  should  be  accounted  an  extravagant  freak .PERIOD that  's  what  we  all  have  to  watch  out  for ,COMMA especially  at  this  meeting .PERIOD and  so  prejudice  my  readers  against  all  those  things  which  were  the  main  design  of  the  book  now ,COMMA who  today  would  claim  that  as  a  mere  conceit  of  the  human  mind ?QUESTIONMARK that  the  force  that  causes  the  apple  to  fall  to  the  ground  is  the  same  force  that  causes  the  planets  and  the  moon  to  move  around ,COMMA and  so  on ?QUESTIONMARK everybody  knows  that .PERIOD it  's  a  property  of  gravitation .PERIOD it  's  not  something  in  the  human  mind .PERIOD the  human  mind  can ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA appreciate  it  and  enjoy  it ,COMMA use  it ,COMMA but  it  's  not ,COMMA it  does  n't  stem  from  the  human  mind .PERIOD it  stems  from  the  character  of  gravity .PERIOD and  that  's  true  of  all  the  things  we  're  talking  about .PERIOD they  are  properties  of  the  fundamental  law .PERIOD the  fundamental  law  is  such  that  the  different  skins  of  the  onion  resemble  one  another ,COMMA and  therefore  the  math  for  one  skin  allows  you  to  express  beautifully  and  simply  the  phenomenon  of  the  next  skin .PERIOD i  say  here  that  newton  did  a  lot  of  things  that  year ,COMMA gravity ,COMMA the  laws  of  motion ,COMMA the  calculus ,COMMA white  light  composed  of  all  the  colors  of  the  rainbow .PERIOD and  he  could  have  written  quite  an  essay  on  what  i  did  over  my  summer  vacation .PERIOD so  we  do  n't  have  to  assume  these  principles  as  separate  metaphysical  postulates .PERIOD they  follow  from  the  fundamental  theory .PERIOD they  are  what  we  call  emergent  properties .PERIOD you  do  n't  need ,COMMA you  do  n't  need  something  more  to  get  something  more .PERIOD that  's  what  emergence  means .PERIOD life  can  emerge  from  physics  and  chemistry ,COMMA plus  a  lot  of  accidents .PERIOD the  human  mind  can  arise  from  neurobiology  and  a  lot  of  accidents ,COMMA the  way  the  chemical  bond  arises  from  physics  and  certain  accidents .PERIOD it  does  n't  diminish  the  importance  of  these  subjects  to  know  that  they  follow  from  more  fundamental  things ,COMMA plus  accidents .PERIOD that  's  a  general  rule ,COMMA and  it  's  critically  important  to  realize  that .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  something  more  in  order  to  get  something  more .PERIOD people  keep  asking  that  when  they  read  my  book ,COMMA the  quark  and  the  jaguar .PERIOD and  they  say ,COMMA is  n't  there  something  more  beyond  what  you  have  there  presumably ,COMMA they  mean  something  supernatural .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA there  is  n't .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  something  more  to  explain  something  more .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD i  write  about  food .PERIOD i  write  about  cooking .PERIOD i  take  it  quite  seriously ,COMMA but  i  'm  here  to  talk  about  something  that  's  become  very  important  to  me  in  the  last  year  or  two .PERIOD it  is  about  food ,COMMA but  it  's  not  about  cooking ,COMMA per  se .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  start  with  this  picture  of  a  beautiful  cow .PERIOD i  'm  not  a  vegetarian ,COMMA this  is  the  old  nixon  line ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK but  i  still  think  that  this ,COMMA may  be  this  year  's  version  of  this .PERIOD now ,COMMA that  is  only  a  little  bit  hyperbolic .PERIOD and  why  do  i  say  it ?QUESTIONMARK because  only  once  before  has  the  fate  of  individual  people  and  the  fate  of  all  of  humanity  been  so  intertwined .PERIOD there  was  the  bomb ,COMMA and  there  's  now .PERIOD and  where  we  go  from  here  is  going  to  determine  not  only  the  quality  and  the  length  of  our  individual  lives ,COMMA but  whether ,COMMA if  we  could  see  the  earth  a  century  from  now ,COMMA we'd  recognize  it .PERIOD it  's  a  holocaust  of  a  different  kind ,COMMA and  hiding  under  our  desks  is  n't  going  to  help .PERIOD start  with  the  notion  that  global  warming  is  not  only  real ,COMMA but  dangerous .PERIOD since  every  scientist  in  the  world  now  believes  this ,COMMA and  even  president  bush  has  seen  the  light ,COMMA or  pretends  to ,COMMA we  can  take  this  is  a  given .PERIOD then  hear  this ,COMMA please .PERIOD after  energy  production ,COMMA livestock  is  the  second-highest  contributor  to  atmosphere-altering  gases .PERIOD nearly  one-fifth  of  all  greenhouse  gas  is  generated  by  livestock  production ,COMMA more  than  transportation .PERIOD now ,COMMA you  can  make  all  the  jokes  you  want  about  cow  farts ,COMMA but  methane  is  20  times  more  poisonous  than  co2 ,COMMA and  it  's  not  just  methane .PERIOD livestock  is  also  one  of  the  biggest  culprits  in  land  degradation ,COMMA air  and  water  pollution ,COMMA water  shortages  and  loss  of  biodiversity .PERIOD there  's  more .PERIOD like  half  the  antibiotics  in  this  country  are  not  administered  to  people ,COMMA but  to  animals .PERIOD but  lists  like  this  become  kind  of  numbing ,COMMA so  let  me  just  say  this ,COMMA if  you  're  a  progressive ,COMMA if  you  're  driving  a  prius ,COMMA or  you  're  shopping  green ,COMMA or  you  're  looking  for  organic ,COMMA you  should  probably  be  a  semi-vegetarian .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  'm  no  more  anti-cattle  than  i  am  anti-atom ,COMMA but  it  's  all  in  the  way  we  use  these  things .PERIOD there  's  another  piece  of  the  puzzle ,COMMA which  ann  cooper  talked  about  beautifully  yesterday ,COMMA and  one  you  already  know .PERIOD there  's  no  question ,COMMA none ,COMMA that  so-called  lifestyle  diseases ,COMMA diabetes ,COMMA heart  disease ,COMMA stroke ,COMMA some  cancers ,COMMA are  diseases  that  are  far  more  prevalent  here  than  anywhere  in  the  rest  of  the  world .PERIOD and  that  's  the  direct  result  of  eating  a  western  diet .PERIOD our  demand  for  meat ,COMMA dairy  and  refined  carbohydrates ,COMMA the  world  consumes  one  billion  cans  or  bottles  of  coke  a  day ,COMMA our  demand  for  these  things ,COMMA not  our  need ,COMMA our  want ,COMMA drives  us  to  consume  way  more  calories  than  are  good  for  us .PERIOD and  those  calories  are  in  foods  that  cause ,COMMA not  prevent ,COMMA disease .PERIOD now  global  warming  was  unforeseen .PERIOD we  did  n't  know  that  pollution  did  more  than  cause  bad  visibility .PERIOD maybe  a  few  lung  diseases  here  and  there ,COMMA but ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA that  's  not  such  a  big  deal .PERIOD the  current  health  crisis ,COMMA however ,COMMA is  a  little  more  the  work

benefits  of  eating  plants  here ,COMMA but  the  evidence  is  that  plants ,COMMA and  i  want  to  make  this  clear ,COMMA it  's  not  the  ingredients  in  plants ,COMMA it  's  the  plants .PERIOD it  's  not  the  beta-carotene ,COMMA it  's  the  carrot .PERIOD the  evidence  is  very  clear  that  plants  promote  health .PERIOD this  evidence  is  overwhelming  at  this  point .PERIOD you  eat  more  plants ,COMMA you  eat  less  other  stuff ,COMMA you  live  longer .PERIOD not  bad .PERIOD but  back  to  animals  and  junk  food .PERIOD what  do  they  have  in  common

,COMMA both  have  been  marketed  heavily ,COMMA creating  unnatural  demand .PERIOD we  're  not  born  craving  whoppers  or  skittles .PERIOD three ,COMMA their  production  has  been  supported

 guess  what ?QUESTIONMARK half  the  people  who  developed  the  food  pyramid  have  ties  to  agribusiness .PERIOD so ,COMMA instead  of  substituting  plants  for  animals ,COMMA our  swollen  appetites  simply  became  larger ,COMMA and  the  most  dangerous  aspects  of  them  remained  unchanged .PERIOD so-called  low-fat  diets ,COMMA so-called  low-carb  diets ,COMMA these  are  not

get  the  idea .PERIOD that  's  just  the  united  states .PERIOD and  with  our  hyper-consumption  of  those  animals  producing  greenhouse  gases  and  heart  disease ,COMMA kindness  might  just  be  a  bit  of  a  red  herring .PERIOD let  's  get  the  numbers  of  the  animals  we  're  killing  for  eating  down ,COMMA and  then  we  'll  worry  about  being  nice  to  the  ones  that

people  were  healthy ,COMMA educated ,COMMA rich ,COMMA and  they  had  small  families .PERIOD and  their  aspiration  was  to  buy  a  car .PERIOD and  in  1960 ,COMMA all  swedes  were  saving  to

aspiration  of  the  average  family  there  was  to  have  food  for  the  day .PERIOD they  were  saving  to  be  able  to  buy  a  pair  of  shoes .PERIOD there  was  an  enormous  gap  in  the  world  when  i  grew  up .PERIOD and  this  gap  between  the  west  and  the  rest  has  created  a  mindset  of  the  world ,COMMA which  we  still  use  linguistically  when  we  talk  about  the  west  and  the  developing  world .PERIOD but  the  world  has  changed ,COMMA and  it  's  overdue  to  upgrade  that  mindset  and  that  taxonomy  of  the  world ,COMMA and  to  understand  it .PERIOD and  that  's  what  i  'm  going  to  show  you .PERIOD because  since  1960  what  has  happened  in  the  world  up  to  2010  is  that  a  staggering  four  billion  people  have  been  added  to  the  world  population .PERIOD just  look  how  many .PERIOD the  world  population  has  doubled  since  i  went  to  school .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA there  's  been  economic  growth  in  the  west .PERIOD a  lot  of  companies  have  happened  to  grow  the  economy ,COMMA so  the  western  population  moved  over  to  here .PERIOD and  now  their  aspiration  is  not  only  to  have  a  car .PERIOD now  they  want  to  have  a  holiday  on  a  very  remote  destination  and  they  want  to  fly .PERIOD so  this  is  where  they  are  today .PERIOD and  the  most  successful  of  the  developing  countries ,COMMA they  have  moved  on ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD and  they  have  become  emerging  economies ,COMMA we  call  them .PERIOD they  are  now  buying  cars .PERIOD and  what  happened  a  month  ago  was  that  the  chinese  company ,COMMA geely ,COMMA they  acquired  the  volvo  company .PERIOD and  then  finally  the  swedes  understood  that  something  big  had  happened  in  the  world .PERIOD so  there  they  are .PERIOD and  the  tragedy  is  that  the  two  billion  over  here  that  is  struggling  for  food  and  shoes ,COMMA they  are  still  almost  as  poor  as  they  were  50  years  ago .PERIOD the  new  thing  is  that  we  have  the  biggest  pile  of  billions ,COMMA the  three  billions  here ,COMMA which  are  also  becoming  emerging  economies ,COMMA because  they  are  quite  healthy ,COMMA relatively  well-educated ,COMMA and  they  already  also  have  two  to  three  children  per  woman ,COMMA as  those  richer  also  have .PERIOD and  their  aspiration  now  is ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA to  buy  a  bicycle ,COMMA and  then  later  on  they  would  like  to  have  a  motorbike  also .PERIOD but  this  is  the  world  we  have  today .PERIOD no  longer  any  gap .PERIOD but  the  distance  from  the  poorest  here ,COMMA the  very  poorest ,COMMA to  the  very  richest  over  here  is  wider  than  ever .PERIOD but  there  is  a  continuous  world  from  walking ,COMMA biking ,COMMA driving ,COMMA flying ,COMMA there  are  people  on  all  levels .PERIOD and  most  people  tend  to  be

.PERIOD i  was  in  shanghai  recently .PERIOD and  i  listened  to  what  's  happening  in  china .PERIOD and  it  's  pretty  sure  that  they  will  catch  up ,COMMA just  as  japan  did .PERIOD all  the  projections  say  that  this  one  billion  will  only  grow  with  one  to  two  or  three  percent .PERIOD but  this  second  grows  with  seven ,COMMA eight  percent ,COMMA and  then  they  will  end  up  here .PERIOD they  will  start  flying .PERIOD and  these  lower  or  middle  income  countries ,COMMA the  emerging  income  countries ,COMMA they  will  also  forge  forwards  economically .PERIOD and  if ,COMMA but  only  if ,COMMA we  invest  in  the  right  green  technology ,COMMA so  that  we  can  avoid  severe  climate  change ,COMMA and  energy  can  still  be  relatively  cheap ,COMMA then  they  will  move  all  the  way  up  here .PERIOD and  they  will  start  to  buy  electric  cars .PERIOD this  is  what  we  will  find  there .PERIOD so  what  about  the  poorest  two  billion ?QUESTIONMARK what  about  the  poorest  two  billion  here ?QUESTIONMARK will  they  move  on ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA here  population  growth  comes  in  because  there  among  emerging  economies  we  already  have  two  to  three  children  per  woman ,COMMA family  planning  is  widely  used ,COMMA and  population  growth  is  coming  to  an  end .PERIOD here  among  the  poorest ,COMMA population  is  growing .PERIOD so  these  poorest  two  billion  will ,COMMA in  the  next  decades ,COMMA increase  to  three  billion .PERIOD and  they  will  thereafter  increase  to  four  billion .PERIOD there  is  nothing ,COMMA but  a  nuclear  war  of  a  kind  we've  never  seen ,COMMA that  can  stop  this  growth  from  happening .PERIOD because  we  already  have  this  growth  in  process .PERIOD but  if ,COMMA and  only  if ,COMMA the  poorest  get  out  of  poverty ,COMMA they  get  education ,COMMA they  get  improved  child  survival ,COMMA they  can  buy  a  bicycle  and  a  cell  phone  and  come  to  live  here ,COMMA then  population  growth  will  stop  in  2050 .PERIOD we  cannot  have  people  on  this  level  looking  for  food  and  shoes

person  on  the  planet  is  given  free  access  to  the  sum  of  all  human  knowledge .PERIOD and  that  's  what  we  're  doing .PERIOD so  wikipedia ,COMMA you  just  saw  the  little  demonstration  of  it ,COMMA it  's  a  freely  licensed  encyclopedia .PERIOD it  's  written  by  thousands  of  volunteers  all  over  the  world  in  many ,COMMA many  languages .PERIOD it  's  written  using  wiki  software ,COMMA which  is  the  type  of  software  he  just  demonstrated ,COMMA so  anyone  can  quickly  edit  and  save ,COMMA and  it  goes  live  on  the  internet  immediately .PERIOD and  everything  about  wikipedia  is  managed  by  virtually  an  all-volunteer  staff .PERIOD so  when  yochai  is  talking  about  new  methods  of  organization ,COMMA he  's  exactly  describing  wikipedia .PERIOD and  what  i  'm  going  to  do  today  is  tell  you  a  little  bit  more  about  how  it  really  works  on  the  inside .PERIOD so  wikipedia  's  owned  by  the  wikimedia  foundation ,COMMA which  i  founded ,COMMA a  nonprofit  organization .PERIOD and  our  goal ,COMMA the  core  aim  of  the  wikimedia  foundation ,COMMA is  to  get  a  free  encyclopedia  to  every  single  person  on  the  planet .PERIOD and  so  if  you  think  about  what  that  means ,COMMA it  means  a  lot  more  than  just  building  a  cool  website .PERIOD we  're  really  interested  in  all  the  issues  of  the  digital  divide ,COMMA poverty  worldwide ,COMMA empowering  people  everywhere  to  have  the  information  that  they  need  to  make  good  decisions .PERIOD and  so  we  're  going  to  have  to  do  a  lot  of  work  that  goes  beyond  just  the  internet .PERIOD and  so  that  's  a  big  part  of  why  we've  chosen  the  free  licensing  model ,COMMA because  that  empowers  local  entrepreneurs ,COMMA or  anyone  who  wants  to ,COMMA can  take  our  content  and  do  anything  they  like  with  it ,COMMA you  can  copy  it ,COMMA redistribute  it  and  you  can  do  it  commercially  or  non-commercially .PERIOD so  there  's  a  lot  of  opportunities  that  are  going  to  arise  around  wikipedia  all  over  the  world .PERIOD we  're  funded  by  donations  from  the  public ,COMMA and  one  of  the  more  interesting  things  about  that  is  how  little  money  it  actually  takes  to  run  wikipedia .PERIOD so  yochai  showed  you  the  graph  of  what  the  cost  of  a  printing  press  was .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  tell  you  what  the  cost  of  wikipedia  is ,COMMA but  first  i  'll  show  you  how  big  it  is .PERIOD so  we've  got  over  600,000  articles  in  english .PERIOD we've  got  two  million  total  articles  across  many ,COMMA many  different  languages .PERIOD the  biggest  languages  are  german ,COMMA japanese ,COMMA french  -- .PERIOD all  the  western  european  languages  are  quite  big .PERIOD but  only  around  one-third  of  all  of  our  traffic  to  our  web  clusters  to  the  english  wikipedia ,COMMA which  is  surprising  to  a  lot  of  people .PERIOD a  lot  of  people  think  in  a  very  english-centric  way  on  the  internet ,COMMA but  for  us ,COMMA we  're  truly  global .PERIOD we  're  in  many ,COMMA many  languages .PERIOD how  popular  we've  gotten  to  be ,COMMA we  're  a  top  50  website  and  we  're  more  popular  than  the  new  york  times .PERIOD so  this  is  where  we  get  to  yochai  's  discussion .PERIOD this  shows  the  growth  of  wikipedia ,COMMA we  're  the  blue  line  there ,COMMA and  then  this  is  the  new  york  times  over  there .PERIOD and  what  's  interesting  about  this  is  the  new  york  times  website  is  a  huge ,COMMA enormous  corporate  operation  with ,COMMA i  have  no  idea  how  many  hundreds  of  employees .PERIOD we  have  exactly  one  employee ,COMMA and  that  employee  is  our  lead  software  developer .PERIOD and  he  's  only  been  our  employee  since  january  2005 ,COMMA all  the  other  growth  before  that .PERIOD so  the  servers  are  managed  by  a  rag-tag  band  of  volunteers .PERIOD all  the  editing  is  done  by  volunteers .PERIOD and  the  way  that  we  're  organized  is  not  like  any  traditional  organization  you  can  imagine .PERIOD people  are  always  asking ,COMMA well ,COMMA who  's  in  charge  of  this ?QUESTIONMARK or  who  does  that  and  the  answer  is ,COMMA anybody  who  wants  to  pitch  in .PERIOD it  's  a  very  unusual  and  chaotic  thing .PERIOD we've  got  over  90  servers  now  in  three  locations .PERIOD these  are  managed  by  volunteer  system  administrators  who  are  online .PERIOD i  can  go  online  any  time  of  the  day  or  night  and  see  eight  to  10  people  waiting  for  me  to  ask  a  question  or  something ,COMMA anything  about  the  servers .PERIOD you  could  never  afford  to  do  this  in  a  company .PERIOD you  could  never  afford  to  have  a  standby  crew  of  people  24  hours  a  day  and  do  what  we  're  doing  at  wikipedia .PERIOD so  we  're  doing  around  14  billion  page  views  monthly ,COMMA so  it  's  really  gotten  to  be  a  huge  thing .PERIOD and  everything  is  managed  by  the  volunteers .PERIOD and  the  total  monthly  cost  for  our  bandwidth  is  about  5,000  dollars .PERIOD and  that  's  essentially  our  main  cost .PERIOD we  could  actually  do  without  the  employee .PERIOD we  actually ,COMMA we  hired  brian  because  he  was  working  part-time  for  two  years  and  full-time  at  wikipedia ,COMMA so  we  actually  hired  him  so  he  could  get  a  life  and  go  to  the  movies  sometimes .PERIOD so  the  big  question  when  you've  got  this  really  chaotic  organization  is ,COMMA why  is  n't  it  all  rubbish ?QUESTIONMARK why  is  the  website  as  good  as  it  is ?QUESTIONMARK first  of  all ,COMMA how  good  is  it ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA it  's  pretty  good .PERIOD it  is  n't  perfect ,COMMA but  it  's  much ,COMMA much  better  than  you  would  expect ,COMMA given  our  completely  chaotic  model .PERIOD so  when  you  saw  him  make  a  ridiculous  edit  to  the  page  about  me ,COMMA you  think ,COMMA oh ,COMMA this  is  obviously  just  going  to  degenerate  into  rubbish .PERIOD but  when  we've  seen  quality  tests ,COMMA and  there  have  n't  been  enough  of  these  yet  and  i  'm  really  encouraging  people  to  do  more ,COMMA comparing  wikipedia  to  traditional  things ,COMMA we  win  hands  down .PERIOD so  a  german  magazine  compared  german  wikipedia ,COMMA which  is  really  much ,COMMA much  smaller  than  english ,COMMA to  microsoft  encarta  and  to  brockhaus  multimedia ,COMMA and  we  won  across  the  board .PERIOD they  hired  experts  to  come  and  look  at  articles  and  compare  the  quality ,COMMA and  we  were  very  pleased  with  that  result .PERIOD so  a  lot  of  people  have  heard  about  the  wikipedia  bush-kerry  controversy .PERIOD the  media  has  covered  this  somewhat  extensively .PERIOD it  started  out  with  an  article  in  red  herring .PERIOD the  reporters  called  me  up  and  they ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA i  have  to  say  they  spelled  my  name  right ,COMMA but  they  really  wanted  to  say ,COMMA the  bush-kerry  election  is  so  contentious ,COMMA it  's  tearing  apart  the  wikipedia  community .PERIOD and  so  they  quote  me  as  saying ,COMMA they  're  the  most  contentious  in  the  history  of  wikipedia .PERIOD what  i  actually  said  is ,COMMA they  're  not  contentious  at  all .PERIOD so  it  's  a  slight  misquote .PERIOD the  articles  were  edited  quite  heavily .PERIOD and  it  is  true  that  we  did  have  to  lock  the  articles  on  a  couple  of  occasions .PERIOD time  magazine  recently  reported  that  extreme  action  sometimes  has  to  be  taken ,COMMA and  wales  locked  the  entries  on  kerry  and  bush  for  most  of  2004 .PERIOD this  came  after  i  told  the  reporter  that  we  had  to  lock  it  for ,COMMA occasionally  a  little  bit  here  and  there .PERIOD so  the  truth  in  general  is  that  the  kinds  of  controversies  that  you  would  probably  think  we  have  within  the  wikipedia  community  are  not  really  controversies  at  all .PERIOD articles  on  controversial  topics  are  edited  a  lot ,COMMA but  they  do  n't  cause  much  controversy  within  the  community .PERIOD and  the  reason  for  this  is  that  most  people  understand  the  need  for  neutrality .PERIOD the  real  struggle  is  not  between  the  right  and  the  left ,COMMA that  's  where  most  people  assume ,COMMA but  it  's  between  the  party  of  the  thoughtful  and  the  party  of  the  jerks .PERIOD and  no  side  of  the  political  spectrum  has  a  monopoly  on  either  of  those  qualities .PERIOD the  actual  truth  about  the  specific  bush-kerry  incident  is  that  the  bush-kerry  articles  were  locked  less  than  one  percent  of  the  time  in  2004 ,COMMA and  it  was  n't  because  they  were  contentious .PERIOD it  was  just  because  there  was  routine  vandalism ,COMMA which  happens  sometimes  even  on  stage ,COMMA people ,COMMA sometimes  even  reporters  have  reported  to  me  that  they  vandalize  wikipedia  and  were  amazed  that  it  was  fixed  so  quickly .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA i  always  say ,COMMA please  do  n't  do  that .PERIOD that  's  not  a  good  thing .PERIOD so  how  do  we  do  this ?QUESTIONMARK how  do  we  manage  the  quality  control ?QUESTIONMARK how  does  it  work ?QUESTIONMARK so  there  's  a  few  elements ,COMMA mostly  social  policies  and  some  elements  of  the  software .PERIOD so  the  biggest  and  the  most  important  thing  is  our  neutral  point-of-view  policy .PERIOD this  is  something  that  i  set  down  from  the  very  beginning ,COMMA as  a  core  principle  of  the  community  that  's  completely  not  debatable .PERIOD it  's  a  social  concept  of  cooperation ,COMMA so  we  do  n't  talk  a  lot  about  truth  and  objectivity .PERIOD the  reason  for  this  is  if  we  say  we  're  only  going  to  write  the  truth  about  some  topic ,COMMA that  does  n't  do  us  a  damn  bit  of  good  of  figuring  out  what  to  write ,COMMA because  i  do  n't  agree  with  you  about  what  's  the  truth .PERIOD but  we  have  this  jargon  term  of  neutrality ,COMMA which  has  its  own  long  history  within  the  community ,COMMA which  basically  says ,COMMA any  time  there  's  a  controversial  issue ,COMMA wikipedia  itself  should  not  take  a  stand  on  the  issue .PERIOD we  should  merely  report  on  what  reputable  parties  have  said  about  it .PERIOD so  this  neutrality  policy  is  really  important  for  us ,COMMA because  it  empowers  a  community  that  is  very  diverse  to  come  together  and  actually  get  some  work  done .PERIOD so  we  have  very  diverse  contributors  in  terms  of  political ,COMMA religious ,COMMA cultural  backgrounds .PERIOD by  having  this  firm  neutrality  policy ,COMMA which  is  non-negotiable  from  the  beginning ,COMMA we  ensure  that  people  can  work  together  and  that  the  entries  do  n't  become  simply  a  war  back  and  forth  between  the  left  and  the  right .PERIOD if  you  engage  in  that  type  of  behavior ,COMMA you  'll  be  asked  to  leave  the  community .PERIOD so  real-time  peer  review .PERIOD every  single  change  on  the  site  goes  to  the  recent  changes  page .PERIOD so  as  soon  as  he  made  his  change ,COMMA it  went  to  the  recent  changes  page .PERIOD that  recent  changes  page  was  also  fed  into  irc  channel ,COMMA which  is  an  internet  chat  channel  that  people  are  monitoring  with  various  software  tools .PERIOD and  people  can  get  rss  feeds ,COMMA they  can  get  e-mail  notifications  of  changes .PERIOD and  then  users  can  set  up  their  own  personal  watch  list .PERIOD so  my  page  is  on  quite  a  few  volunteers  watch  lists ,COMMA because  it  is  sometimes  vandalized .PERIOD and  therefore ,COMMA what  happens  is  someone  will  notice  the  change  very  quickly ,COMMA and  then  they  'll  just  simply  revert  the  change .PERIOD there  's  a  new  pages  feed ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA so  you  can  go  to  a  certain  page  of  wikipedia  and  see  every  new  page  as  it  's  created .PERIOD this  is  really  important ,COMMA because  a  lot  of  new  pages  that  get  created  are  just  garbage  that  have  to  be  deleted ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA asdfasdf .PERIOD but  also  that  's  some  of  the  most  interesting  and  fun  things  at  wikipedia ,COMMA some  of  the  new  articles .PERIOD people  will  start  an  article  on  some  interesting  topic ,COMMA other  people  will  find  that  intriguing  and  jump  in  and  help  and  make  it  much  better .PERIOD so  we  do  have  edits  by  anonymous  users ,COMMA which  is  one  of  the  most  controversial  and  intriguing  things  about  wikipedia .PERIOD so  chris  was  able  to  do  his  change ,COMMA he  did  n't  have  to  log  in  or  anything .PERIOD he  just  went  on  the  website  and  made  a  change .PERIOD but  it  turns  out  that  only  about  18  percent  of  all  the  edits  to  the  website  are  done  by  anonymous  users .PERIOD and  that  's  a  really  important  thing  to  understand ,COMMA is  that  the  vast  majority  of  the  edits  that  go  on  on  the  website  are  from  a  very  close-knit  community  of  maybe  600  to  1,000  people  who  are  in  constant  communication .PERIOD and  we  have  over  40  irc  channels ,COMMA 40  mailing  lists .PERIOD all  these  people  know  each  other .PERIOD they  communicate .PERIOD we  have  offline  meetings .PERIOD these  are  the  people  who  are  doing  the  bulk  of  the  site ,COMMA and  they  are ,COMMA in  a  sense ,COMMA semi-professionals  at  what  they  're  doing ,COMMA that  the  standards  we  set  for  ourselves  are  equal  to  or  higher  than  professional  standards  of  quality .PERIOD we  do  n't  always  meet  those  standards ,COMMA but  that  's  what  we  're  striving  for .PERIOD and  so  that  tight  community  is  who  really  cares  for  the  site ,COMMA and  these  are  some  of  the  smartest  people  i've  ever  met .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA it  's  my  job  to  say  that ,COMMA but  it  's  actually  true .PERIOD the  type  of  people  who  were  drawn  to  writing  an  encyclopedia  for  fun  tend  to  be  pretty  smart  people .PERIOD the  tools  and  the  software ,COMMA there  's  lots  of  tools  that  allow  us ,COMMA allow  us ,COMMA meaning  the  community ,COMMA to  self-monitor  and  to  monitor  all  the  work .PERIOD this  is  an  example  of  a  page  history  on  flat  earth ,COMMA and  you  can  see  some  changes  that  were  made .PERIOD what  's  nice  about  this  page  is  you  can  immediately  take  a  look  at  this  and  see ,COMMA oh  ok ,COMMA i  understand  now .PERIOD when  somebody  goes  and  looks  at ,COMMA they  see  that  someone ,COMMA an  anonymous  ip  number ,COMMA made  an  edit  to  my  page ,COMMA that  sounds  suspicious ,COMMA who  is  this  person ?QUESTIONMARK somebody  looks  at  it ,COMMA they  can  immediately  see  highlighted  in  red  all  of  the  changes  that  took  place ,COMMA to  see ,COMMA ok ,COMMA well ,COMMA these  words  have  changed ,COMMA things  like  this .PERIOD so  that  's  one  tool  that  we  can  use  to  very  quickly  monitor  the  history  of  a  page .PERIOD another  thing  that  we  do  within  the  community  is  we  leave  everything  very  open-ended .PERIOD most  of  the  social  rules  and  the  methods  of  work  are  left  completely  open-ended  in  the  software .PERIOD all  of  that  stuff  is  just  on  wiki  pages .PERIOD and  so  there  's  nothing  in  the  software  that  enforces  the  rules .PERIOD the  example  i've  got  up  here  is  a  votes  for  deletion  page .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  mentioned  earlier ,COMMA people  type  asdfasdf ,COMMA it  needs  to  be  deleted .PERIOD cases  like  that ,COMMA the  administrators  just  delete  it .PERIOD there  's  no  reason  to  have  a  big  argument  about  it .PERIOD but  you  can  imagine  there  's  a  lot  of  other  areas  where  the  question  is ,COMMA is  this  notable  enough  to  go  in  an  encyclopedia ?QUESTIONMARK is  the  information  verifiable ?QUESTIONMARK is  it  a  hoax ?QUESTIONMARK is  it  true ?QUESTIONMARK is  it  what ?QUESTIONMARK so  we  needed  a  social  method  for  figuring  out  the  answer  to  this .PERIOD and  so  the  method  that  arose  organically  within  the  community  is  the  votes  for  deletion  page .PERIOD and  in  the  particular  example  we  have  here ,COMMA it  's  a  film ,COMMA twisted  issues ,COMMA and  the  first  person  says ,COMMA now  this  is  supposedly  a  film .PERIOD it  fails  the  google  test  miserably .PERIOD the  google  test  is ,COMMA you  look  in  google  and  see  if  it  's  there ,COMMA because  if  something  's  not  even  in  google ,COMMA it  probably  does  n't  exist  at  all .PERIOD it  's  not  a  perfect  rule ,COMMA but  it  's  a  nice  starting  point  for  quick  research .PERIOD so  somebody  says ,COMMA delete  it ,COMMA please .PERIOD delete  it ,COMMA it  's  not  notable .PERIOD and  then  somebody  says ,COMMA wait ,COMMA wait ,COMMA wait ,COMMA wait ,COMMA i  found  it .PERIOD i  found  it  in  a  book ,COMMA film  threat  video  guide ,COMMA the  20  underground  films  you  must  see' .PERIOD oh ,COMMA ok .PERIOD so  the  next  persons  says ,COMMA clean  it  up  somebody  says ,COMMA i've  found  it  on  imdb .PERIOD keep ,COMMA keep ,COMMA keep .PERIOD and  what  's  interesting  about  this  is  that  the  software  is ,COMMA these  votes  are  just ,COMMA they  're  just  text  typed  into  a  page .PERIOD this  is  not  really  a  vote  so  much  as  it  is  a  dialogue .PERIOD now  it  is  true  that  at  the  end  of  the  day  an  administrator  can  go  through  here  and  take  a  look  at  this  and  say ,COMMA ok ,COMMA 18  deletes ,COMMA two  keeps ,COMMA we  'll  delete  it .PERIOD but  in  other  cases ,COMMA this  could  be  18  deletes  and  two  keeps ,COMMA and  we  would  keep  it ,COMMA because  if  those  last  two  keeps  say ,COMMA wait  a  minute ,COMMA wait  a  minute .PERIOD nobody  else  saw  this  but  i  found  it  in  a  book ,COMMA and  i  found  a  link  to  a  page  that  describes  it ,COMMA and  i  'm  going  to  clean  it  up  tomorrow ,COMMA so  please  do  n't  delete  it ,COMMA then  it  would  survive .PERIOD and  it  also  matters  who  the  people  are  who  are  voting .PERIOD like  i  say ,COMMA it  's  a  tight  knit  community .PERIOD down  here  at  the  bottom ,COMMA keep ,COMMA real  movie ,COMMA rick  kay .PERIOD rick  kay  is  a  very  famous  wikipedian  who  does  an  enormous  amount  of  work  with  vandalism ,COMMA hoaxes  and  votes  for  deletion .PERIOD his  voice  carries  a  lot  of  weight  within  the  community  because  he  knows  what  he  's  doing .PERIOD so  how  's  all  this  governed ?QUESTIONMARK people  really  want  to  know  about ,COMMA ok ,COMMA administrators ,COMMA things  like  that .PERIOD so  the  wikipedia  governance  model ,COMMA the  governance  of  the  community ,COMMA is  a  very  confusing ,COMMA but  a  workable  mix  of  consensus  -- .PERIOD meaning  we  try  not  to  vote  on  the  content  of  articles ,COMMA because  the  majority  view  is  not  necessarily  neutral .PERIOD some  amount  of  democracy ,COMMA all  of  the  administrators ,COMMA these  are  the  people  who  have  the  ability  to  delete  pages ,COMMA that  does  n't  mean  that  they  have  the  right  to  delete  pages .PERIOD they  still  have  to  follow  all  the  rules ,COMMA but  they  're  elected .PERIOD they  're  elected  by  the  community .PERIOD sometimes  people ,COMMA random  trolls  on  the  internet ,COMMA like  to  accuse  me  of  handpicking  the  administrators  to  bias  the  content  of  the  encyclopedia .PERIOD i  always  laugh  at  this ,COMMA because  i  have  no  idea  how  they  're  elected ,COMMA actually .PERIOD there  's  a  certain  amount  of  aristocracy .PERIOD and  so  you've  got  a  hint  of  that  when  i  mentioned ,COMMA like ,COMMA rick  kay  's  voice  would  carry  a  lot  more  weight  than  someone  we  do  n't  know .PERIOD i  give  this  talk  sometimes  with  angela ,COMMA who  was  just  re-elected  to  the  board  from  the  community ,COMMA to  the  board  of  the  foundation ,COMMA with  more  than  twice  the  votes  of  the  person  who  did  n't  make  it .PERIOD and  i  always  embarrass  her  because  i  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA angela ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA could  get  away  with  doing  absolutely  anything  within  wikipedia ,COMMA because  she  's  so  admired  and  so  powerful .PERIOD but  the  irony  is ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA that  angela  can  do  this  because  she  's  the  one  person  who  you  know  would  never ,COMMA ever ,COMMA ever  break  any  rules  of  wikipedia .PERIOD and  i  also  like  to  say  she  's  the  only  person  who  actually  knows  all  the  rules  of  wikipedia ,COMMA so .PERIOD and  then  there  's  monarchy  and  that  's  my  role  on  the  community ,COMMA so .PERIOD i  was  describing  this  in  berlin  once  and  the  next  day  in  the  newspaper  the  headline  said ,COMMA i  am  the  queen  of  england .PERIOD and  that  's  not  exactly  what  i  said   ,COMMA but ,COMMA the  point  is  my  role  in  the  community ,COMMA within  the  free  software  world  there  's  been  a  longstanding  tradition  of  the  benevolent  dictator  model .PERIOD so  if  you  look  at  most  of  the  major  free  software  projects ,COMMA they  have  one  single  person  in  charge  who  everyone  agrees  is  the  benevolent  dictator .PERIOD well ,COMMA i  do  n't  like  the  term  benevolent  dictator ,COMMA and  i  do  n't  think  that  it  's  my  job  or  my  role  in  the  world  of  ideas  to  be  the  dictator  of  the  future  of  all  human  knowledge  compiled  by  the  world .PERIOD it  just  is  n't  appropriate .PERIOD but  there  is  a  need  still  for  a  certain  amount  of  monarchy ,COMMA a  certain  amount  of ,COMMA sometimes  we  have  to  make  a  decision ,COMMA and  we  do  n't  want  to  get  bogged  down  too  heavily  in  formal  decision-making  processes .PERIOD so  as  an  example  of  why  this  has  been ,COMMA or  how  this  can  be  important ,COMMA we  recently  had  a  situation  where  a  neo-nazi  website  discovered  wikipedia ,COMMA and  they  said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA this  is  horrible ,COMMA this  jewish  conspiracy  of  a  website  and  we  're  going  to  get  certain  articles  deleted  that  we  do  n't  like .PERIOD and  we  see  they  have  a  voting  process ,COMMA so  we  're  going  to  send ,COMMA we  have  40,000  members  and  we  're  going  to  send  them  over  and  they  're  all  going  to  vote  and  get  these  pages  deleted .PERIOD well ,COMMA they  managed  to  get  18  people  to  show  up .PERIOD that  's  neo-nazi  math  for  you .PERIOD they  always  think  they've  got  40,000  members  when  they've  got  18 .PERIOD but  they  managed  to  get  18  people  to  come  and  vote  in  a  fairly  absurd  way  to  delete  a  perfectly  valid  article .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA the  vote  ended  up  being  about  85  to  18 ,COMMA so  there  was  no  real  danger  to  our  democratic  processes .PERIOD on  the  other  hand ,COMMA people  said ,COMMA but  what  are  we  going  to  do ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA this  could  happen  and  what  if  some  group  gets  really  seriously  organized  and  comes  in  and  wants  to  vote ?QUESTIONMARK then  i  said ,COMMA well  fuck  it ,COMMA we  'll  just  change  the  rules .PERIOD that  's  my  job  in  the  community ,COMMA to  say  we  wo  n't  allow  our  openness  and  freedom  to  undermine  the  quality  of  the  content .PERIOD and  so  as  long  as  people  trust  me  in  my  role ,COMMA then  that  's  a  valid  place  for  me .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA because  of  the  free  licensing ,COMMA if  i  do  a  bad  job ,COMMA the  volunteers  are  more  than  happy  to  take  and  leave  -- .PERIOD i  cannot  tell  anyone  what  to  do .PERIOD so  the  final  point  here  is  that  to  understand  how  wikipedia  works ,COMMA it  's  important  to  understand  that  our  wiki  model  is  the  way  we  work ,COMMA but  we  are  not  fanatical  web  anarchists .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA we  're  very  flexible  about  the  social  methodology ,COMMA because  it  's  ultimately  the  passion  of  the  community  is  for  the  quality  of  the  work .PERIOD not  necessarily  for  the  process  that  we  use  to  generate  it .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD ben  saunders ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA hi ,COMMA ben  saunders .PERIOD jimmy ,COMMA you  mentioned  impartiality  being  a  key  to  wikipedia  's  success .PERIOD it  strikes  me  that  much  of  the  textbooks  that  are  used  to  educate  our  children  are  inherently  biased .PERIOD have  you  found  wikipedia  being  used  by  teachers ,COMMA and  how  do  you  see  wikipedia  changing  education ?QUESTIONMARK jimmy  wales ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA so ,COMMA a  lot  of  teachers  are  beginning  to  use  wikipedia .PERIOD there  's  a  media  storyline  about  wikipedia ,COMMA which  i  think  is  false .PERIOD it  builds  on  the  storyline  of  bloggers  versus  newspapers .PERIOD and  the  storyline  is ,COMMA there  's  this  crazy  thing ,COMMA wikipedia ,COMMA but  academics  hate  it  and  teachers  hate  it .PERIOD and  that  turns  out  to  not  be  true .PERIOD the  last  time  i  got  an  e-mail  from  a  journalist  saying ,COMMA why  do  academics  hate  wikipedia ?QUESTIONMARK i  sent  it  from  my  harvard  email  address ,COMMA because  i  was  recently  appointed  a  fellow  there .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA they  do  n't  all  hate  it .PERIOD but  i  think  there  's  going  to  be  huge  impacts .PERIOD and  we  actually  have  a  project  that  i  'm  personally  really  excited  about ,COMMA which  is  the  wiki  books  project ,COMMA which  is  an  effort  to  create  textbooks  in  all  the  languages .PERIOD and  that  's  a  much  bigger  project .PERIOD it  's  going  to  take  20  years  or  so  to  come  to  fruition .PERIOD but  part  of  that  is  to  fulfill  our  mission  of  giving  an  encyclopedia  to  every  single  person  on  the  planet .PERIOD we  do  n't  mean  we  're  going  to  spam  them  with  aol-style  cds .PERIOD we  mean  we  're  going  to  give  them  a  tool  that  they  can  use .PERIOD and  for  a  lot  of  people  in  the  world ,COMMA if  i  give  you  an  encyclopedia  that  's  written  at  a  university  level ,COMMA it  does  n't  do  you  any  good  without  a  whole  host  of  literacy  materials  to  build  you  up  to  the  point  where  you  can  actually  use  it .PERIOD and  so  the  wiki  books  project  is  an  effort  to  do  that .PERIOD and  i  think  that  we  're  going  to  really  see  a  huge ,COMMA it  may  not  even  come  from  us .PERIOD there  's  all  kinds  of  innovation  going  on .PERIOD but  freely  licensed  textbooks  are  the  next  big  thing  in  education .PERIOD what  i  want  to  talk  to  you  about  today  is  some  of  the  problems  that  the  military  of  the  western  world ,COMMA australia ,COMMA united  states ,COMMA uk .PERIOD and  so  on ,COMMA face  in  some  of  the  deployments  that  they  're  dealing  with  in  the  modern  world  at  this  time .PERIOD if  you  think  about  the  sorts  of  things  that  we've  sent  australian  military  personnel  to  in  recent  years ,COMMA we've  got  obvious  things  like  iraq  and  afghanistan ,COMMA but  you've  also  got  things  like  east  timor  and  the  solomon  islands  and  so  on .PERIOD and  a  lot  of  these  deployments  that  we  're  actually  sending  military  personnel  to  these  days  are  n't  traditional  wars .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA a  lot  of  the  jobs  that  we  're  asking  the  military  personnel  to  do  in  these  situations  are  ones  that ,COMMA in  their  own  countries ,COMMA in  australia ,COMMA the  united  states  and  so  on ,COMMA would  actually  be  done  by  police  officers .PERIOD and  so  there  's  a  bunch  of  problems  that  come  up  for  military  personnel  in  these  situations ,COMMA because  they  're  doing  things  that  they  have  n't  really  been  trained  for ,COMMA and  they  're  doing  things  that  those  who  do  them  in  their  own  countries  are  trained  very  differently  for  and  equipped  very  differently  for .PERIOD now  there  's  a  bunch  of  reasons  why  we  actually  do  send  military  personnel  rather  than  police  to  do  these  jobs .PERIOD if  australia  had  to  send  a  thousand  people  tomorrow  to  west  papua  for  example ,COMMA we  do  n't  have  a  thousand  police  officers  hanging  around  that  could  just  go  tomorrow  and  we  do  have  a  thousand  soldiers  that  could  go .PERIOD so  when  we  have  to  send  someone ,COMMA we  send  the  military ,COMMA because  they  're  there ,COMMA they  're  available  and ,COMMA heck ,COMMA they  're  used  to  going  off  and  doing  these  things  and  living  by  themselves  and  not  having  all  this  extra  support .PERIOD so  they  are  able  to  do  it  in  that  sense .PERIOD but  they  are  n't  trained  in  the  same  way  that  police  officers  are  and  they  're  certainly  not  equipped  in  the  same  way  police  officers  are .PERIOD and  so  this  has  raised  a  bunch  of  problems  for  them  when  dealing  with  these  sorts  of  issues .PERIOD one  particular  thing  that  's  come  up  that  i  am  especially  interested  in  is  the  question  of  whether ,COMMA when  we  're  sending  military  personnel  to  do  these  sorts  of  jobs ,COMMA we  ought  to  be  equipping  them  differently ,COMMA and  in  particular ,COMMA whether  we  ought  to  be  giving  them  access  to  some  of  the  sorts  of  non-lethal  weapons  that  police  have .PERIOD since  they  're  doing  some  of  these  same  jobs ,COMMA maybe  they  should  have  some  of  those  things .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA there  's  a  range  of  places  where  you'd  think  those  things  would  be  really  useful .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA when  you've  got  military  checkpoints .PERIOD if  people  are  approaching  these  checkpoints  and  the  military  personnel  there  are  unsure  whether  this  person  's  hostile  or  not .PERIOD say  this  person  approaching  here ,COMMA and  they  say ,COMMA well  is  this  a  suicide  bomber  or  not ?QUESTIONMARK have  they  got  something  hidden  under  their  clothing ?QUESTIONMARK what  's  going  to  happen ?QUESTIONMARK they  do  n't  know  whether  this  person  's  hostile  or  not .PERIOD if  this  person  does  n't  follow  directions ,COMMA then  they  may  end  up  shooting  them  and  then  find  out  afterward  either ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we  shot  the  right  person ,COMMA or ,COMMA no ,COMMA this  was  just  an  innocent  person  who  did  n't  understand  what  was  going  on .PERIOD so  if  they  had  non-lethal  weapons  then  they  would  say ,COMMA well  we  can  use  them  in  that  sort  of  situation .PERIOD if  we  shoot  someone  who  was  n't  hostile ,COMMA at  least  we  have  n't  killed  them .PERIOD another  situation .PERIOD this  photo  is  actually  from  one  of  the  missions  in  the  balkans  in  the  late  1990s .PERIOD situation  's  a  little  bit  different  where  perhaps  they  know  someone  who  's  hostile ,COMMA where  they've  got  someone  shooting  at  them  or  doing  something  else  that  's  clearly  hostile ,COMMA throwing  rocks ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD but  if  they  respond ,COMMA there  's  a  range  of  other  people  around ,COMMA who  are  innocent  people  who  might  also  get  hurt ,COMMA be  collateral  damage  that  the  military  often  does  n't  want  to  talk  about .PERIOD so  again ,COMMA they  would  say ,COMMA well  if  we  have  access  to  non-lethal  weapons ,COMMA if  we've  got  someone  we  know  is  hostile ,COMMA we  can  do  something  to  deal  with  them  and  know  that  if  we  hit  anyone  else  around  the  place ,COMMA at  least ,COMMA again ,COMMA we  're  not  going  to  kill  them .PERIOD another  suggestion  has  been ,COMMA since  we  're  putting  so  many  robots  in  the  field ,COMMA we  can  see  the  time  coming  they  're  going  to  make  their  own  decisions  about  who  to  shoot  and  who  not  to  shoot  without  a  human  in  the  loop .PERIOD and  so  the  suggestion  is ,COMMA well  hey ,COMMA if  we  're  going  to  send  robots  out  and  allow  them  to  do  this ,COMMA maybe  it  would  be  a  good  idea ,COMMA again ,COMMA with  these  things  if  they  were  armed  with  non-lethal  weapons  so  that  if  the  robot  makes  a  bad  decision  and  shoots  the  wrong  person ,COMMA again ,COMMA they  have  n't  actually  killed  them .PERIOD now  there  's  a  whole  range  of  different  sorts  of  non-lethal  weapons ,COMMA some  of  which  are  obviously  available  now ,COMMA some  of  which  they  're  developing .PERIOD so  you've  got  traditional  things  like  pepper  spray ,COMMA oc .PERIOD spray  up  at  the  top  there ,COMMA or  tasers  over  here .PERIOD the  one  on  the  top  right  here  is  actually  a  dazzling  laser  intended  to  just  blind  the  person  momentarily  and  disorient  them .PERIOD you've  got  non-lethal  shotgun  rounds  that  contain  rubber  pellets  instead  of  the  traditional  metal  ones .PERIOD and  this  one  in  the  middle  here ,COMMA the  large  truck ,COMMA is  actually  called  the  active  denial  system ,COMMA something  the  us .PERIOD military  is  working  on  at  the  moment .PERIOD it  's  essentially  a  big  microwave  transmitter .PERIOD it  's  sort  of  your  classic  idea  of  a  heat  ray .PERIOD it  goes  out  to  a  really  long  distance ,COMMA compared  to  any  of  these  other  sorts  of  things .PERIOD and  anybody  who  is  hit  with  this  feels  this  sudden  burst  of  heat  and  just  wants  to  get  out  of  the  way .PERIOD it  is  a  lot  more  sophisticated  than  a  microwave  oven ,COMMA but  it  is  basically  boiling  the  water  molecules  in  the  very  surface  level  of  your  skin .PERIOD so  you  feel  this  massive  heat ,COMMA and  you  go ,COMMA i  want  to  get  out  of  the  way .PERIOD and  they  're  thinking ,COMMA well  this  will  be  really  useful  in  places  like  where  we  need  to  clear  a  crowd  out  of  a  particular  area ,COMMA if  the  crowd  is  being  hostile .PERIOD if  we  need  to  keep  people  away  from  a  particular  place ,COMMA we  can  do  that  with  these  sorts  of  things .PERIOD so  obviously  there  's  a  whole  range  of  different  sorts  of  non-lethal  weapons  we  could  give  military  personnel  and  there  's  a  whole  range  of  situations  where  they  're  looking  a  them  and  saying ,COMMA hey ,COMMA these  things  could  be  really  useful .PERIOD but  as  i  said ,COMMA the  military  and  the  police  are  very  different .PERIOD yes ,COMMA you  do  n't  have  to  look  very  hard  at  this  to  recognize  the  fact  that  they  might  be  very  different .PERIOD in  particular ,COMMA the  attitude  to  the  use  of  force  and  the  way  they  're  trained  to  use  force  is  especially  different .PERIOD the  police ,COMMA and  knowing  because  i've  actually  helped  to  train  police ,COMMA police ,COMMA in  particular  western  jurisdictions  at  least ,COMMA are  trained  to  de-escalate  force ,COMMA to  try  and  avoid  using  force  wherever  possible ,COMMA and  to  use  lethal  force  only  as  an  absolute  last  resort .PERIOD military  personnel  are  being  trained  for  war ,COMMA so  they  're  trained  that ,COMMA as  soon  as  things  go  bad ,COMMA their  first  response  is  lethal  force .PERIOD the  moment  the  fecal  matter  hits  the  rotating  turbine ,COMMA you  can  start  shooting  at  people .PERIOD so  their  attitudes  to  the  use  of  lethal  force  are  very  different ,COMMA and  i  think  it  's  fairly  obvious  that  their  attitude  to  the  use  of  non-lethal  weapons  would  also  be  very  different  from  what  it  is  with  the  police .PERIOD and  since  we've  already  had  so  many  problems  with  police  use  of  non-lethal  weapons  in  various  ways ,COMMA i  thought  it  would  be  a  really  good  idea  to  look  at  some  of  those  things  and  try  to  relate  it  to  the  military  context .PERIOD and  i  was  really  surprised  when  i  started  to  do  this ,COMMA to  see  that ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA even  those  people  who  were  advocating  the  use  of  non-lethal  weapons  by  the  military  had  n't  actually  done  that .PERIOD they  generally  seem  to  think ,COMMA well ,COMMA why  would  we  care  what  's  happened  with  the  police ?QUESTIONMARK we  're  looking  at  something  different .PERIOD and  did  n't  seem  to  recognize ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA they  were  looking  at  pretty  much  the  same  stuff .PERIOD so  i  actually  started  to  investigate  some  of  those  issues  and  have  a  look  at  the  way  that  police  use  non-lethal  weapons  when  they  're  introduced  and  some  of  the  problems  that  might  arise  out  of  those  sorts  of  things  when  they  actually  do  introduce  them .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA being  australian ,COMMA i  started  looking  at  stuff  in  australia ,COMMA knowing ,COMMA again ,COMMA from  my  own  experience  about  various  times  when  non-lethal  weapons  have  been  introduced  in  australia .PERIOD so  one  of  the  things  i  particularly  looked  at  was  the  use  of  oc .PERIOD spray ,COMMA oleoresin  capsicum  spray ,COMMA pepper  spray ,COMMA by  australian  police  and  seeing  when  that  had  been  introduced ,COMMA what  had  happened  and  those  sorts  of  issues .PERIOD and  one  study  that  i  found ,COMMA a  particularly  interesting  one ,COMMA was  actually  in  queensland ,COMMA because  they  had  a  trial  period  for  the  use  of  pepper  spray  before  they  actually  introduced  it  more  broadly .PERIOD and  i  went  and  had  a  look  at  some  of  the  figures  here .PERIOD now  when  they  introduced  oc .PERIOD spray  in  queensland ,COMMA they  were  really  explicit .PERIOD the  police  minister  had  a  whole  heap  of  public  statements  made  about  it .PERIOD they  were  saying ,COMMA this  is  explicitly  intended  to  give  police  an  option  between  shouting  and  shooting .PERIOD this  is  something  they  can  use  instead  of  a  firearm  in  those  situations  where  they  would  have  previously  had  to  shoot  someone .PERIOD so  i  went  and  looked  at  all  of  these  police  shooting  figures .PERIOD and  you  cannot  actually  find  them  very  easily  for  individual  australian  states .PERIOD i  could  only  find  these  ones .PERIOD this  is  from  a  australian  institute  of  criminology  report .PERIOD as  you  can  see  from  the  fine  print ,COMMA if  you  can  read  it  at  the  top ,COMMA police  shooting  deaths  means  not  just  people  who  have  been  shot  by  police ,COMMA but  people  who  have  shot  themselves  in  the  presence  of  police .PERIOD but  this  is  the  figures  across  the  entire  country .PERIOD and  the  red  arrow  represents  the  point  where  queensland  actually  said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA this  is  where  we  're  going  to  give  all  police  officers  across  the  entire  state  access  to  oc .PERIOD spray .PERIOD so  you  can  see  there  were  six  deaths  sort  of  leading  up  to  it  every  year  for  a  number  of  years .PERIOD there  was  a  spike ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA a  few  years  before ,COMMA but  that  was  n't  actually  queensland .PERIOD anyone  know  where  that  was ?QUESTIONMARK was  n't  port  arthur ,COMMA no .PERIOD victoria ?QUESTIONMARK yes ,COMMA correct .PERIOD that  spike  was  all  victoria .PERIOD so  it  was  n't  that  queensland  had  a  particular  problem  with  deaths  from  police  shootings  and  so  on .PERIOD so  six  shootings  across  the  whole  country ,COMMA fairly  consistently  over  the  years  before .PERIOD so  the  next  two  years  were  the  years  they  studied ,COMMA 2001 ,COMMA 2002 .PERIOD anyone  want  to  take  a  stab  at  the  number  of  times ,COMMA given  how  they've  introduced  this ,COMMA the  number  of  times  police  in  queensland  used  oc .PERIOD spray  in  that  period ?QUESTIONMARK hundreds ?QUESTIONMARK one ,COMMA three .PERIOD thousand  is  getting  better .PERIOD explicitly  introduced  as  an  alternative  to  the  use  of  lethal  force ,COMMA an  alternative  between  shouting  and  shooting .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  go  out  on  a  limb  here  and  say  that  if  queensland  police  did  n't  have  oc .PERIOD spray ,COMMA they  would  n't  have  shot  2,226  people  in  those  two  years .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA if  you  have  a  look  at  the  studies  that  they  were  looking  at ,COMMA the  material  they  were  collecting  and  examining ,COMMA you  can  see  the  suspects  were  only  armed  in  about  15  percent  of  cases  where  oc .PERIOD spray  was  used .PERIOD it  was  routinely  being  used  in  this  period ,COMMA and ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA still  is  routinely  used ,COMMA because  there  were  no  complaints  about  it ,COMMA not  within  the  context  of  this  study  anyway ,COMMA it  was  routinely  being  used  to  deal  with  people  who  were  violent ,COMMA who  were  potentially  violent ,COMMA and  also  quite  frequently  used  to  deal  with  people  who  were  simply  passively  non-compliant .PERIOD this  person  is  not  doing  anything  violent ,COMMA but  they  just  wo  n't  do  what  we  want  them  to .PERIOD they  're  not  obeying  the  directions  that  we  're  giving  them ,COMMA so  we  'll  give  them  a  shot  of  the  oc .PERIOD spray .PERIOD that  'll  speed  them  up .PERIOD everything  will  work  out  better  that  way .PERIOD this  was  something  explicitly  introduced  to  be  an  alternative  to  firearms ,COMMA but  it  's  being  routinely  used  to  deal  with  a  whole  range  of  other  sorts  of  problems .PERIOD now  one  of  the  particular  issues  that  comes  up  with  military  use  of  non-lethal  weapons ,COMMA and  people  when  they  're  actually  saying ,COMMA well  hey ,COMMA there  might  be  some  problems ,COMMA there  's  a  couple  of  particular  problems  that  get  focused  on .PERIOD one  of  those  problems  is  that  non-lethal  weapons  may  be  used  indiscriminately .PERIOD one  of  the  fundamental  principles  of  military  use  of  force  is  that  you  have  to  be  discriminate .PERIOD you  have  to  be  careful  about  who  you  're  shooting  at .PERIOD so  one  of  the  problems  that  's  been  suggested  with  non-lethal  weapons  is  that  they  might  be  used  indiscriminately ,COMMA that  you  use  them  against  a  whole  range  of  people  because  you  do  n't  have  to  worry  so  much  anymore .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA one  particular  instance  where  i  think  that  actually  happens  where  you  can  look  at  it  was  the  dubrovka  theatre  siege  in  moscow  in  2002 ,COMMA which  probably  a  lot  of  you ,COMMA unlike  most  of  my  students  at  adfa ,COMMA are  actually  old  enough  to  remember .PERIOD so  chechens  had  come  in  and  taken  control  of  the  theater .PERIOD they  were  holding  something  like  700  people  hostage .PERIOD they'd  released  a  bunch  of  people ,COMMA but  they  still  had  about  700  people  hostage .PERIOD and  the  russian  special  military  police ,COMMA special  forces ,COMMA spetsnaz ,COMMA came  in  and  actually  stormed  the  theater .PERIOD and  the  way  they  did  it  was  to  pump  the  whole  thing  full  of  anesthetic  gas .PERIOD and  it  turned  out  that  lots  of  these  hostages  actually  died  as  a  result  of  inhaling  the  gas .PERIOD it  was  used  indiscriminately .PERIOD they  pumped  the  whole  theater  full  of  the  gas .PERIOD and  it  's  no  surprise  that  people  died ,COMMA because  you  do  n't  know  how  much  of  this  gas  each  person  is  going  to  inhale ,COMMA what  position  they  're  going  to  fall  in  when  they  become  unconscious  and  so  on .PERIOD there  were ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA only  a  couple  of  people  who  got  shot  in  this  episode .PERIOD so  when  they  had  a  look  at  it  afterward ,COMMA there  were  only  a  couple  of  people  who'd  apparently  been  shot  by  the  hostage  takers  or  shot  by  the  police  forces  coming  in  and  trying  to  deal  with  the  situation .PERIOD virtually  everybody  that  got  killed  got  killed  from  inhaling  the  gas .PERIOD the  final  toll  of  hostages  is  a  little  unclear ,COMMA but  it  's  certainly  a  few  more  than  that ,COMMA because  there  were  other  people  who  died  over  the  next  few  days .PERIOD so  this  was  one  particular  problem  they  talked  about ,COMMA that  it  might  be  used  indiscriminately .PERIOD second  problem  that  people  sometimes  talk  about  with  military  use  of  non-lethal  weapons ,COMMA and  it  's  actually  the  reason  why  in  the  chemical  weapons  convention ,COMMA it  's  very  clear  that  you  cannot  use  riot  control  agents  as  a  weapon  of  warfare ,COMMA the  problem  with  that  is  that  it  's  seen  that  sometimes  non-lethal  weapons  might  actually  be  used ,COMMA not  as  an  alternative  to  lethal  force ,COMMA but  as  a  lethal  force  multiplier ,COMMA that  you  use  non-lethal  weapons  first  so  that  your  lethal  weapons  will  actually  be  more  effective .PERIOD the  people  you  're  going  to  be  shooting  at  are  n't  going  to  be  able  to  get  out  of  the  way .PERIOD they  're  not  going  to  be  aware  of  what  's  happening  and  you  can  kill  them  better .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA that  's  exactly  what  happened  here .PERIOD the  hostage  takers  who  had  been  rendered  unconscious  by  the  gas  were  not  taken  into  custody ,COMMA they  were  simply  shot  in  the  head .PERIOD so  this  non-lethal  weapon  was  being  used ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA in  this  case  as  a  lethal  force  multiplier  to  make  killing  more  effective  in  this  particular  situation .PERIOD another  problem  that  i  just  want  to  quickly  mention  is  that  there  's  a  whole  heap  of  problems  with  the  way  that  people  actually  get  taught  to  use  non-lethal  weapons  and  get  trained  about  them  and  then  get  tested  and  so  on .PERIOD because  they  get  tested  in  nice ,COMMA safe  environments .PERIOD and  people  get  taught  to  use  them  in  nice ,COMMA safe  environments  like  this ,COMMA where  you  can  see  exactly  what  's  going  on .PERIOD the  person  who  's  spraying  the  oc .PERIOD spray  is  wearing  a  rubber  glove  to  make  sure  they  do  n't  get  contaminated  and  so  on .PERIOD but  they  do  n't  ever  get  used  like  that .PERIOD they  get  used  out  in  the  real  world ,COMMA like  in  texas ,COMMA like  this .PERIOD i  confess ,COMMA this  particular  case  was  actually  one  that  piqued  my  interest  in  this .PERIOD it  happened  while  i  was  working  as  a  research  fellow  at  the  us .PERIOD naval  academy .PERIOD and  news  reports  started  coming  up  about  this  situation  where  this  woman  was  arguing  with  the  police  officer .PERIOD she  was  n't  violent .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA he  was  probably  six  inches  taller  than  me ,COMMA and  she  was  about  this  tall .PERIOD and  eventually  she  said  to  him  well  i  'm  going  to  get  back  in  my  car .PERIOD and  he  says ,COMMA if  you  get  back  into  your  car ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  tase  you .PERIOD and  she  says ,COMMA oh ,COMMA go  ahead .PERIOD tase  me  and  so  he  does .PERIOD and  it  's  all  captured  by  the  video  camera  running  in  the  front  of  the  police  car .PERIOD so  she  's  72 ,COMMA and  it  's  seen  that  this  is  the  most  appropriate  way  of  dealing  with  her .PERIOD and  other  examples  of  the  same  sorts  of  things  with  other  people  where  you  think  where  you  think ,COMMA is  this  really  an  appropriate  way  to  use  non-lethal  weapons ?QUESTIONMARK police  chief  fires  taser  into  14  year-old  girl  's  head .PERIOD she  was  running  away .PERIOD what  else  was  i  suppose  to  do ?QUESTIONMARK or  florida ,COMMA police  taser

favorite  of  these  ones ,COMMA i  have  to  confess ,COMMA does  actually  come  from  the  united  states ,COMMA officers  taser  86  year-old  disabled  woman  in  her  bed .PERIOD i  checked  the  reports  on  this  one .PERIOD i  looked  at  it .PERIOD i  was  really  surprised .PERIOD apparently  she  took  up  a  more  threatening  position  in  her  bed .PERIOD i  kid  you  not .PERIOD that  's  exactly  what  it  said .PERIOD she  took  up  a  more  threatening  position  in  her  bed .PERIOD okay .PERIOD but  i'd  remind  you  what  i  'm  talking  about ,COMMA i  'm  talking  about  military  uses  of  non-lethal  weapons .PERIOD so  why  is  this  relevant ?QUESTIONMARK because  police  are  actually  more  restrained  in  the  use  of  force  than  the  military  are .PERIOD they  're  trained  to  be  more  restrained  in  the  use  of  force  than  the  military  are .PERIOD they  're  trained  to  think  more ,COMMA to  try  and  de-escalate .PERIOD so  if  you  have  these  problems  with  police  officers  with  non-lethal  weapons ,COMMA what  on  earth  would  make  you  think  it  's  going  to  be  better  with  military  personnel ?QUESTIONMARK the  last  thing  that  i  would  just  like  to  say ,COMMA when  i  'm  talking  to  the  police  about  what  a  perfect  non-lethal  weapon  would  look  like ,COMMA they  almost  inevitably  say  the  same  thing .PERIOD they  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA it  's  got  to  be  something  that  's  nasty  enough  that  people  do  n't  want  to  be  hit  with  this  weapon .PERIOD so  if  you  threaten  to  use  it ,COMMA people  are  going  to  comply  with  it ,COMMA but  it  's  also  going  to  be  something  that  does  n't  leave  any  lasting  effects .PERIOD in  other  words ,COMMA your  perfect  non-lethal  weapon  is  something  that  's  perfect  for  abuse .PERIOD what  would  these  guys  have  done  if  they'd  had  access  to  tasers  or  to  a  manned ,COMMA portable  version  of  the  active  denial  system ,COMMA a  small  heat  ray  that  you  can  use  on  people  and  not  worry  about  it .PERIOD so  i  think ,COMMA yes ,COMMA there  may  be  ways  that  non-lethal  weapons  are  going  to  be  great  in  these  situations ,COMMA but  there  's  also  a  whole  heap  of  problems  that  need  to  be  considered  as  well .PERIOD thanks  very  much .PERIOD okay ,COMMA i  have  no  idea  what  we  're  going  to  play .PERIOD i  wo  n't  be  able  to  tell  you  what  it  is  until  it  happens .PERIOD i  did  n't  realize  there  was  going  to  be  a  little  music  before .PERIOD so  i  think  i  'm  going  to  start  with  what  i  just  heard .PERIOD okay ,COMMA so  first  of  all ,COMMA let  's  welcome  mr.  jamire  williams  on  the  drums ,COMMA burniss  travis  on  the  bass ,COMMA and  mr.  christian  sands  on  the  piano .PERIOD so  the  bandstand ,COMMA as  we  call  it ,COMMA this  is  an  incredible  space .PERIOD it  is  really  a  sacred  space .PERIOD and  one  of  the  things  that  is  really  sacred  about  it  is  that  you  have  no  opportunity  to  think  about  the  future ,COMMA or  the  past .PERIOD you  really  are  alive  right  here  in  this  moment .PERIOD there  are  so  many  decisions  being  made  when  you  walk  on  the  bandstand .PERIOD we  had  no  idea  what  key  we  were  going  to  play  in .PERIOD in  the  middle ,COMMA we  sort  of  made  our  way  into  a  song  called  titi  boom .PERIOD but  that  could  have  happened ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA maybe  not .PERIOD everyone  's  listening .PERIOD we  're  responding .PERIOD you  have  no  time  for  projected  ideas .PERIOD so  the  idea  of  a  mistake ,COMMA from  the  perspective  of  a  jazz  musician ,COMMA it  's  easier  to  talk  about  someone  else  's  mistake .PERIOD so  the  way  i  perceive  a  mistake  when  i  'm  on  the  bandstand ,COMMA first  of  all ,COMMA we  do  n't  really  see  it  as  a  mistake .PERIOD the  only  mistake  lies  in  that  i  'm  not  able  to  perceive  what  it  is  that  someone  else  did .PERIOD every  mistake  is  an  opportunity  in  jazz .PERIOD so  it  's  hard  to  even  describe  what  a  funny  note  would  be .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA if  i  played  a  color ,COMMA like  we  were  playing  on  a  palette ,COMMA that  sounded  like  this .PERIOD so  if  christian  played  a  note ,COMMA like  play  an  f .PERIOD see ,COMMA these  are  all  right  inside  of  the  color  palette .PERIOD if  you  played  an  e .PERIOD see ,COMMA these  all  lie  right  inside  of  this  general  emotional  palette  that  we  were  painting .PERIOD if  you  played  an  f#  though ,COMMA to  most  people  's  ears ,COMMA they  would  perceive  that  as  a  mistake .PERIOD so  i  'm  going  to  show  you ,COMMA we  're  going  to  play  just  for  a  second .PERIOD and  we  're  going  to  play  on  this  palette .PERIOD and  at  some  point ,COMMA christian  will  introduce  this  note .PERIOD and  we  wo  n't  react  to  it .PERIOD he  'll  introduce  it  for  a  second  and  then  i  'll  stop ,COMMA i  'll  talk  for  a  second .PERIOD we  'll  see  what  happens  when  we  play  with  this  palette .PERIOD so  someone  could  conceptually  perceive  that  as  a  mistake .PERIOD the  only  way  that  i  would  say  it  was  a  mistake  is  in  that  we  did  n't  react  to  it .PERIOD it  was  an  opportunity  that  was  missed .PERIOD so  it  's  unpredictable .PERIOD we  'll  paint  this  palette  again .PERIOD he  'll  play  it .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  how  we  'll  react  to  it ,COMMA but  something  will  change .PERIOD we  'll  all  accept  his  ideas ,COMMA or  not .PERIOD so  you  see ,COMMA he  played  this  note .PERIOD i  ended  up  creating  a  melody  out  of  it .PERIOD the  texture  changed  in  the  drums  this  time .PERIOD it  got  a  little  bit  more  rhythmic ,COMMA a  little  bit  more  intense  in  response  to  how  i  responded  to  it .PERIOD so  there  is  no  mistake .PERIOD the  only  mistake  is  if  i  'm  not  aware ,COMMA if  each  individual  musician  is  not  aware  and  accepting  enough  of  his  fellow  band  member  to  incorporate  the  idea  and  we  do  n't  allow  for  creativity .PERIOD so  jazz ,COMMA this  bandstand  is  absolutely  amazing .PERIOD it  's  a  very  purifying  experience .PERIOD and  i  know  that  i  speak  for  all  of  us  when  i  tell  you  that  we  do  n't  take  it  for  granted .PERIOD we  know  that  to  be  able  to  come  on  the  bandstand  and  play  music  is  a  blessing .PERIOD so  how  does  this  all  relate  to  behavioral  finance ?QUESTIONMARK well  we  're  jazz  musicians ,COMMA so  stereotypically  we  do  n't  have  a  great  relationship  to  finance .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA i  just  wanted  to  sort  of  point  out  the  way  that  we  handle  it .PERIOD and  the  other  dynamic  of  it  is  that  we  do  n't  micromanage  in  jazz .PERIOD you  have  some  people  who  do .PERIOD but  what  that  does  is  it  actually  limits  the  artistic  possibilities .PERIOD if  i  come  up  and  i  dictate  to  the  band  that  i  want  to  play  like  this  and  i  want  the  music  to  go  this  way ,COMMA and  i  just  jump  right  in .PERIOD ready ,COMMA just  play  some  time .PERIOD one ,COMMA two ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four .PERIOD it  's  kind  of  chaotic  because  i  'm  bullying  my  ideas .PERIOD i  'm  telling  them ,COMMA you  come  with  me  over  this  way .PERIOD if  i  really  want  the  music  to  go  there ,COMMA the  best  way  for  me  to  do  it  is  to  listen .PERIOD this  is  a  science  of  listening .PERIOD it  has  far  more  to  do  with  what  i  can  perceive  than  what  it  is  that  i  can  do .PERIOD so  if  i  want  the  music  to  get  to  a  certain  level  of  intensity ,COMMA the  first  step  for  me  is  to  be  patient ,COMMA to  listen  to  what  's  going  on  and  pull  from  something  that  's  going  on  around  me .PERIOD when  you  do  that ,COMMA you  engage  and  inspire  the  other  musicians  and  they  give  you  more ,COMMA and  gradually  it  builds .PERIOD watch .PERIOD one ,COMMA two ,COMMA a  one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four .PERIOD totally  different  experience  when  i  'm  pulling  ideas .PERIOD it  's  much  more  organic .PERIOD it  's  much  more  nuanced .PERIOD it  's  not  about  bullying  my  vision  or  anything  like  that .PERIOD it  's  about  being  here  in  the  moment ,COMMA accepting  one  another  and  allowing  creativity  to  flow .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  talk  today  about  saving  more ,COMMA but  not  today ,COMMA tomorrow .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  talk  about  save  more  tomorrow .PERIOD it  's  a  program  that  richard  thaler  from  the  university  of  chicago  and  i  devised  maybe  15  years  ago .PERIOD the  program ,COMMA in  a  sense ,COMMA is  an  example  of  behavioral  finance  on  steroids ,COMMA how  we  could  really  use  behavioral  finance .PERIOD now  you  might  ask ,COMMA what  is  behavioral  finance ?QUESTIONMARK so  let  's  think  about  how  we  manage  our  money .PERIOD let  's  start  with  mortgages .PERIOD it  's  kind  of  a  recent  topic ,COMMA at  least  in  the  us .PERIOD a  lot  of  people  buy  the  biggest  house  they  can  afford ,COMMA and  actually  slightly  bigger  than  that .PERIOD and  then  they  foreclose .PERIOD and  then  they  blame  the  banks  for  being  the  bad  guys  who  gave  them  the  mortgages .PERIOD let  's  also  think  about  how  we  manage  risks ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA investing  in  the  stock  market .PERIOD two  years  ago ,COMMA three  years  ago ,COMMA about  four  years  ago ,COMMA markets  did  well .PERIOD we  were  risk  takers ,COMMA of  course .PERIOD then  market  stocks  seize  and  we  're  like ,COMMA wow .PERIOD these  losses ,COMMA they  feel ,COMMA emotionally ,COMMA they  feel  very  different  from  what  we  actually  thought  about  it  when  markets  were  going  up  so  we  're  probably  not  doing  a  great  job  when  it  comes  to  risk  taking .PERIOD how  many  of  you  have  iphones ?QUESTIONMARK anyone ?QUESTIONMARK wonderful .PERIOD i  would  bet  many  more  of  you  insure  your  iphone ,COMMA you  're  implicitly  buying  insurance  by  having  an  extended  warranty .PERIOD what  if  you  lose  your  iphone ?QUESTIONMARK what  if  you  do  this ?QUESTIONMARK how  many  of  you  have  kids ?QUESTIONMARK anyone ?QUESTIONMARK keep  your  hands  up  if  you  have  sufficient  life  insurance .PERIOD i  see  a  lot  of  hands  coming  down .PERIOD i  would  predict ,COMMA if  you  're  a  representative  sample ,COMMA that  many  more  of  you  insure  your  iphones  than  your  lives ,COMMA even  when  you  have  kids .PERIOD we  're  not  doing  that  well  when  it  comes  to  insurance .PERIOD the  average  american  household  spends  1,000  dollars  a  year  on  lotteries .PERIOD and  i  know  it  sounds  crazy .PERIOD how  many  of  you  spend  a  thousand  dollars  a  year  on  lotteries ?QUESTIONMARK no  one .PERIOD so  that  tells  us  that  the  people  not  in  this  room  are  spending  more  than  a  thousand  to  get  the  average  to  a  thousand .PERIOD low-income  people  spend  a  lot  more  than  a  thousand  on  lotteries .PERIOD so  where  does  it  take  us ?QUESTIONMARK we  're  not  doing  a  great  job  managing  money .PERIOD behavioral  finance  is  really  a  combination  of  psychology  and  economics ,COMMA trying  to  understand  the  money  mistakes  people  make .PERIOD and  i  can  keep  standing  here  for  the  12  minutes  and  53  seconds  that  i  have  left  and  make  fun  of  all  sorts  of  ways  we  manage  money ,COMMA and  at  the  end  you  're  going  to  ask ,COMMA how  can  we  help  people ?QUESTIONMARK and  that  's  what  i  really  want  to  focus  on  today .PERIOD how  do  we  take  an  understanding  of  the  money  mistakes  people  make ,COMMA and  then  turning  the  behavioral  challenges  into  behavioral  solutions ?QUESTIONMARK and  what  i  'm  going  to  talk  about  today  is  save  more  tomorrow .PERIOD i  want  to  address  the  issue  of  savings .PERIOD we  have  on  the  screen  a  representative  sample  of  100  americans .PERIOD and  we  're  going  to  look  at  their  saving  behavior .PERIOD first  thing  to  notice  is ,COMMA half  of  them  do  not  even  have  access  to  a  401  plan .PERIOD they  cannot  make  savings  easy .PERIOD they  cannot  have  money  go  away  from  their  paycheck  into  a  401  plan  before  they  see  it ,COMMA before  they  can  touch  it .PERIOD what  about  the  remaining  half  of  the  people ?QUESTIONMARK some  of  them  elect  not  to  save .PERIOD they  're  just  too  lazy .PERIOD they  never  get  around  to  logging  into  a  complicated  website  and  doing  17  clicks  to  join  the  401  plan .PERIOD and  then  they  have  to  decide  how  they  're  going  to  invest  in  their  52  choices ,COMMA and  they  never  heard  about  what  is  a  money  market  fund .PERIOD and  they  get  overwhelmed  and  the  just  do  n't  join .PERIOD how  many  people  end  up  saving  to  a  401  plan ?QUESTIONMARK one  third  of  americans .PERIOD two  thirds  are  not  saving  now .PERIOD are  they  saving  enough ?QUESTIONMARK take  out  those  who  say  they  save  too  little .PERIOD one  out  of  10  are  saving  enough .PERIOD nine  out  of  10  either  cannot  save  through  their  401  plan ,COMMA decide  not  to  save ,COMMA or  do  n't  decide ,COMMA or  save  too  little .PERIOD we  think  we  have  a  problem  of  people  saving  too  much .PERIOD let  's  look  at  that .PERIOD we  have  one  person ,COMMA well ,COMMA actually  we  're  going  to  slice  him  in  half  because  it  's  less  than  one  percent .PERIOD roughly  half  a  percent  of  americans  feel  that  they  save  too  much .PERIOD what  are  we  going  to  do  about  it ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  what  i  really  want  to  focus  on .PERIOD we  have  to  understand  why  people  are  not  saving ,COMMA and  then  we  can  hopefully  flip  the  behavioral  challenges  into  behavioral  solutions ,COMMA and  then  see  how  powerful  it  might  be .PERIOD so  let  me  divert  for  a  second  as  we  're  going  to  identify  the  problems ,COMMA the  challenges ,COMMA the  behavioral  challenges ,COMMA that  prevent  people  from  saving .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  divert  and  talk  about  bananas  and  chocolate .PERIOD suppose  we  had  another  wonderful  ted  event  next  week .PERIOD and  during  the  break  there  would  be  a  snack  and  you  could  choose  bananas  or  chocolate .PERIOD how  many  of  you  think  you  would  like  to  have  bananas  during  this  hypothetical  ted  event  next  week ?QUESTIONMARK who  would  go  for  bananas ?QUESTIONMARK wonderful .PERIOD i  predict  scientifically  74  percent  of  you  will  go  for  bananas .PERIOD well  that  's  at  least  what  one  wonderful  study  predicted .PERIOD and  then  count  down  the  days  and  see  what  people  ended  up  eating .PERIOD the  same  people  that  imagined  themselves  eating  the  bananas  ended  up  eating  chocolates  a  week  later .PERIOD self-control  is  not  a  problem  in  the  future .PERIOD it  's  only  a  problem  now  when  the  chocolate  is  next  to  us .PERIOD what  does  it  have  to  do  with  time  and  savings ,COMMA this  issue  of  immediate  gratification ?QUESTIONMARK or  as  some  economists  call  it ,COMMA present  bias .PERIOD we  think  about  saving .PERIOD we  know  we  should  be  saving .PERIOD we  know  we  'll  do  it  next  year ,COMMA but  today  let  us  go  and  spend .PERIOD christmas  is  coming .PERIOD we  might  as  well  buy  a  lot  of  gifts  for  everyone  we  know .PERIOD so  this  issue  of  present  bias  causes  us  to  think  about  saving ,COMMA but  end  up  spending .PERIOD let  me  now  talk  about  another  behavioral  obstacle  to  saving  having  to  do  with  inertia .PERIOD but  again ,COMMA a  little  diversion  to  the  topic  of  organ  donation .PERIOD wonderful  study  comparing  different  countries .PERIOD we  're  going  to  look  at  two  similar  countries ,COMMA germany  and  austria .PERIOD and  in  germany ,COMMA if  you  would  like  to  donate  your  organs ,COMMA god  forbid  something  really  bad  happens  to  you ,COMMA when  you  get  your  driving  license  or  an  id ,COMMA you  check  the  box  saying ,COMMA i  would  like  to  donate  my  organs .PERIOD not  many  people  like  checking  boxes .PERIOD it  takes  effort .PERIOD you  need  to  think .PERIOD twelve  percent  do .PERIOD austria ,COMMA a  neighboring  country ,COMMA slightly  similar ,COMMA slightly  different .PERIOD what  's  the  difference ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA you  still  have  choice .PERIOD you  will  decide  whether  you  want  to  donate  your  organs  or  not .PERIOD but  when  you  get  your  driving  license ,COMMA you  check  the  box  if  you  do  not  want  to  donate  your  organ .PERIOD nobody  checks  boxes .PERIOD that  's  kind  of  too  much  effort .PERIOD one  percent  check  the  box .PERIOD the  rest  do  nothing .PERIOD doing  nothing  is  very  common .PERIOD not  many  people  check  boxes .PERIOD what  are  the  implications  to  saving  lives  and  having  organs  available ?QUESTIONMARK in  germany ,COMMA 12  percent  check  the  box .PERIOD twelve  percent  are  organ  donors .PERIOD huge  shortage  of  organs ,COMMA god  forbid ,COMMA if  you  need  one .PERIOD in  austria ,COMMA again ,COMMA nobody  checks  the  box .PERIOD therefore ,COMMA 99  percent  of  people  are  organ  donors .PERIOD inertia ,COMMA lack  of  action .PERIOD what  is  the  default  setting  if  people  do  nothing ,COMMA if  they  keep  procrastinating ,COMMA if  they  do  n't  check  the  boxes ?QUESTIONMARK very  powerful .PERIOD we  're  going  to  talk  about  what  happens  if  people  are  overwhelmed  and  scared  to  make  their  401  choices .PERIOD are  we  going  to  make  them  automatically  join  the  plan ,COMMA or  are  they  going  to  be  left  out ?QUESTIONMARK in  too  many  401  plans ,COMMA if  people  do  nothing ,COMMA it  means  they  're  not  saving  for  retirement ,COMMA if  they  do  n't  check  the  box .PERIOD and  checking  the  box  takes  effort .PERIOD so  we've  chatted  about  a  couple  of  behavioral  challenges .PERIOD one  more  before  we  flip  the  challenges  into  solutions ,COMMA having  to  do  with  monkeys  and  apples .PERIOD no ,COMMA no ,COMMA no ,COMMA this  is  a  real  study  and  it  's  got  a  lot  to  do  with  behavioral  economics .PERIOD one  group  of  monkeys  gets  an  apple ,COMMA they  're  pretty  happy .PERIOD the  other  group  gets  two  apples ,COMMA one  is  taken  away .PERIOD they  still  have  an  apple  left .PERIOD they  're  really  mad .PERIOD why  have  you  taken  our  apple ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  the  notion  of  loss  aversion .PERIOD we  hate  losing  stuff ,COMMA even  if  it  does  n't  mean  a  lot  of  risk .PERIOD you  would  hate  to  go  to  the  atm ,COMMA take  out  100  dollars  and  notice  that  you  lost  one  of  those  $20  bills .PERIOD it  's  very  painful ,COMMA even  though  it  does  n't  mean  anything .PERIOD those  20  dollars  might  have  been  a  quick  lunch .PERIOD so  this  notion  of  loss  aversion  kicks  in  when  it  comes  to  savings  too ,COMMA because  people ,COMMA mentally  and  emotionally  and  intuitively  frame  savings  as  a  loss  because  i  have  to  cut  my  spending .PERIOD so  we  talked  about  all  sorts  of  behavioral  challenges  having  to  do  with  savings  eventually .PERIOD whether  you  think  about  immediate  gratification ,COMMA and  the  chocolates  versus  bananas ,COMMA it  's  just  painful  to  save  now .PERIOD it  's  a  lot  more  fun  to  spend  now .PERIOD we  talked  about  inertia  and  organ  donations  and  checking  the  box .PERIOD if  people  have  to  check  a  lot  of  boxes  to  join  a  401  plan ,COMMA they  're  going  to  keep  procrastinating  and  not  join .PERIOD and  last ,COMMA we  talked  about  loss  aversion ,COMMA and  the  monkeys  and  the  apples .PERIOD if  people  frame  mentally  saving  for  retirement  as  a  loss ,COMMA they  're  not  going  to  be  saving  for  retirement .PERIOD so  we've  got  these  challenges ,COMMA and  what  richard  thaler  and  i  were  always  fascinated  by ,COMMA take  behavioral  finance ,COMMA make  it  behavioral  finance  on  steroids  or  behavioral  finance  20  or  behavioral  finance  in  action ,COMMA flip  the  challenges  into  solutions .PERIOD and  we  came  up  with  an  embarrassingly  simple  solution  called  save  more ,COMMA not  today ,COMMA tomorrow .PERIOD how  is  it  going  to  solve  the  challenges  we  chatted  about ?QUESTIONMARK if  you  think  about  the  problem  of  bananas  versus  chocolates ,COMMA we  think  we  're  going  to  eat  bananas  next  week .PERIOD we  think  we  're  going  to  save  more  next  year .PERIOD save  more  tomorrow  invites  employees  to  save  more  maybe  next  year ,COMMA sometime  in  the  future  when  we  can  imagine  ourselves  eating  bananas ,COMMA volunteering  more  in  the  community ,COMMA exercising  more  and  doing  all  the  right  things  on  the  planet .PERIOD now  we  also  talked  about  checking  the  box  and  the  difficulty  of  taking  action .PERIOD save  more  tomorrow  makes  it  easy .PERIOD it  's  an  autopilot .PERIOD once  you  tell  me  you  would  like  to  save  more  in  the  future ,COMMA let  's  say  every  january  you  're  going  to  be  saving  more  automatically  and  it  's  going  to  go  away  from  your  paycheck  to  the  401  plan  before  you  see  it ,COMMA before  you  touch  it ,COMMA before  you  get  the  issue  of  immediate  gratification .PERIOD but  what  are  we  going  to  do  about  the  monkeys  and  loss  aversion ?QUESTIONMARK next  january  comes  and  people  might  feel  that  if  they  save  more ,COMMA they  have  to  spend  less ,COMMA and  that  's  painful .PERIOD well ,COMMA maybe  it  should  n't  be  just  january .PERIOD maybe  we  should  make  people  save  more  when  they  make  more  money .PERIOD that  way ,COMMA when  they  make  more  money ,COMMA when  they  get  a  pay  raise ,COMMA they  do  n't  have  to  cut  their  spending .PERIOD they  take  a  little  bit  of  the  increase  in  the  paycheck  home  and  spend  more ,COMMA take  a  little  bit  of  the  increase  and  put  it  in  a  401  plan .PERIOD so  that  is  the  program ,COMMA embarrassingly  simple ,COMMA but  as  we  're  going  to  see ,COMMA extremely  powerful .PERIOD we  first  implemented  it ,COMMA richard  thaler  and  i ,COMMA back  in  1998 .PERIOD mid-sized  company  in  the  midwest ,COMMA blue  collar  employees  struggling  to  pay  their  bills  repeatedly  told  us  they  cannot  save  more  right  away .PERIOD saving  more  today  is  not  an  option .PERIOD we  invited  them  to  save  three  percentage  points  more  every  time  they  get  a  pay  raise .PERIOD and  here  are  the  results .PERIOD we  're  seeing  here  a  three  and  a  half-year  period ,COMMA four  pay  raises ,COMMA people  who  were  struggling  to  save ,COMMA were  saving  three  percent  of  their  paycheck ,COMMA three  and  a  half  years  later  saving  almost  four  times  as  much ,COMMA almost  14  percent .PERIOD and  there  's  shoes  and  bicycles  and  things  on  this  chart  because  i  do  n't  want  to  just  throw  numbers  in  a  vacuum .PERIOD i  want ,COMMA really ,COMMA to  think  about  the  fact  that  saving  four  times  more  is  a  huge  difference  in  terms  of  the  lifestyle  that  people  will  be  able  to  afford .PERIOD it  's  real .PERIOD it  's  not  just  numbers  on  a  piece  of  paper .PERIOD whereas  with  saving  three  percent ,COMMA people  might  have  to  add  nice  sneakers  so  they  can  walk ,COMMA because  they  wo  n't  be  able  to  afford  anything  else ,COMMA when  they  save  14  percent  they  might  be  able  to  maybe  have  nice  dress  shoes  to  walk  to  the  car  to  drive .PERIOD this  is  a  real  difference .PERIOD by  now ,COMMA about  60  percent  of  the  large  companies  actually  have  programs  like  this  in  place .PERIOD it  's  been  part  of  the  pension  protection  act .PERIOD and  needless  to  say  that  thaler  and  i  have  been  blessed  to  be  part  of  this  program  and  make  a  difference .PERIOD let  me  wrap  with  two  key  messages .PERIOD one  is  behavioral  finance  is  extremely  powerful .PERIOD this  is  just  one  example .PERIOD message  two  is  there  's  still  a  lot  to  do .PERIOD this  is  really  the  tip  of  the  iceberg .PERIOD if  you  think  about  people  and  mortgages  and  buying  houses  and  then  not  being  able  to  pay  for  it ,COMMA we  need  to  think  about  that .PERIOD if  you  're  thinking  about  people  taking  too  much  risk  and  not  understanding  how  much  risk  they  're  taking  or  taking  too  little  risk ,COMMA we  need  to  think  about  that .PERIOD if  you  think  about  people  spending  a  thousand  dollars  a  year  on  lottery  tickets ,COMMA we  need  to  think  about  that .PERIOD the  average  actually ,COMMA the  record  is  in  singapore .PERIOD the  average  household  spends  $4,000  a  year  on  lottery  tickets .PERIOD we've  got  a  lot  to  do ,COMMA a  lot  to  solve ,COMMA also  in  the  retirement  area  when  it  comes  to  what  people  do  with  their  money  after  retirement .PERIOD one  last  question ,COMMA how  many  of  you  feel  comfortable  that  as  you  're  planning  for  retirement  you  have  a  really  solid  plan  when  you  're  going  to  retire ,COMMA when  you  're  going  to  claim  social  security  benefits ,COMMA what  lifestyle  to  expect ,COMMA how  much  to  spend  every  month  so  you  're  not  going  to  run  out  of  money ?QUESTIONMARK how  many  of  you  feel  you  have  a  solid  plan  for  the  future  when  it  comes  to  post-retirement  decisions .PERIOD one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four .PERIOD less  than  three  percent  of  a  very  sophisticated  audience .PERIOD behavioral  finance  has  a  long  way .PERIOD there  's  a  lot  of  opportunities  to  make  it  powerful  again  and  again  and  again .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  'll  just  take  you  to  bangladesh  for  a  minute .PERIOD before  i  tell  that  story ,COMMA we  should  ask  ourselves  the  question ,COMMA why  does  poverty  exist ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA there  is  plenty  of  knowledge  and  scientific  breakthroughs .PERIOD we  all  live  in  the  same  planet ,COMMA but  there  's  still  a  great  deal  of  poverty  in  the  world .PERIOD and  i  think ,COMMA so  i  want  to  throw  a  perspective  that  i  have ,COMMA so  that  we  can  assess  this  project ,COMMA or  any  other  project ,COMMA for  that  matter ,COMMA to  see  whether  it  's  contributing  or ,COMMA contributing  to  poverty  or  trying  to  alleviate  it .PERIOD rich  countries  have  been  sending  aid  to  poor  countries  for  the  last  60  years .PERIOD and  by  and  large ,COMMA this  has  failed .PERIOD and  you  can  see  this  book ,COMMA written  by  someone  who  worked  in  the  world  bank  for  20  years ,COMMA and  he  finds  economic  growth  in  this  country  to  be  elusive .PERIOD by  and  large ,COMMA it  did  not  work .PERIOD so  the  question  is ,COMMA why  is  that ?QUESTIONMARK in  my  mind ,COMMA there  is  something  to  learn  from  the  history  of  europe .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA even  here ,COMMA yesterday  i  was  walking  across  the  street ,COMMA and  they  showed  three  bishops  were  executed  500  years  ago ,COMMA right  across  the  street  from  here .PERIOD so  my  point  is ,COMMA there  's  a  lot  of  struggle  has  gone  in  europe ,COMMA where  citizens  were  empowered  by  technologies .PERIOD and  they  demanded  authorities  from ,COMMA to  come  down  from  their  high  horses .PERIOD and  in  the  end ,COMMA there  's  better  bargaining  between  the  authorities  and  citizens ,COMMA and  democracies ,COMMA capitalism ,COMMA everything  else  flourished .PERIOD and  so  you  can  see ,COMMA the  real  process  of ,COMMA and  this  is  backed  up  by  this  500-page  book ,COMMA that  the  authorities  came  down  and  citizens  got  up .PERIOD but  if  you  look ,COMMA if  you  have  that  perspective ,COMMA then  you  can  see  what  happened  in  the  last  60  years .PERIOD aid  actually  did  the  opposite .PERIOD it  empowered  authorities .PERIOD and ,COMMA as  a  result ,COMMA marginalized  citizens .PERIOD the  authorities  did  not  have  the  reason  to  make  economic  growth  happen  so  that  they  could  tax  people  and  make  more  money  for  to  run  their  business .PERIOD because  they  were  getting  it  from  abroad .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA if  you  see  oil-rich  countries ,COMMA where  citizens  are  not  yet  empowered ,COMMA the  same  thing  goes  -- .PERIOD nigeria ,COMMA saudi  arabia ,COMMA all  sorts  of  countries .PERIOD because  the  aid  and  oil  or  mineral  money  acts  the  same  way .PERIOD it  empowers  authorities ,COMMA without  activating  the  citizens ,COMMA their  hands ,COMMA legs ,COMMA brains ,COMMA what  have  you .PERIOD and  if  you  agree  with  that ,COMMA then  i  think  the  best  way  to  improve  these  countries  is  to  recognize  that  economic  development  is  of  the  people ,COMMA by  the  people ,COMMA for  the  people .PERIOD and  that  is  the  real  network  effect .PERIOD if  citizens  can  network  and  make  themselves  more  organized  and  productive ,COMMA so  that  their  voices  are  heard ,COMMA so  then  things  would  improve .PERIOD and  to  contrast  that ,COMMA you  can  see  the  most  important  institution  in  the  world ,COMMA the  world  bank ,COMMA is  an  organization  of  the  government ,COMMA by  the  government ,COMMA for  the  governments .PERIOD just  see  the  contrast .PERIOD and  that  is  the  perspective  i  have ,COMMA and  then  i  can  start  my  story .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA how  would  you  empower  citizens ?QUESTIONMARK there  could  be  all  sorts  of  technologies .PERIOD and  one  is  cell  phones .PERIOD recently  the  economist  recognized  this ,COMMA but  i  stumbled  upon  the  idea  12  years  ago ,COMMA and  that  's  what  i've  been  working  on .PERIOD so  12  years  ago ,COMMA i  was  trying  to  be  an  investment  banker  in  new  york .PERIOD we  had ,COMMA quite  a  few  our  colleagues  were  connected  by  a  computer  network .PERIOD and  we  got  more  productive  because  we  did  n't  have  to  exchange  floppy  disks .PERIOD we  could  update  each  other  more  often .PERIOD but  one  time  it  broke  down .PERIOD and  it  reminded  me  of  a  day  in  1971 .PERIOD there  was  a  war  going  on  in  my  country .PERIOD and  my  family  moved  out  of  an  urban  place ,COMMA where  we  used  to  live ,COMMA to  a  remote  rural  area  where  it  was  safer .PERIOD and  one  time  my  mother  asked  me  to  get  some  medicine  for  a  younger  sibling .PERIOD and  i  walked  10  miles  or  so ,COMMA all  morning ,COMMA to  get  there ,COMMA to  the  medicine  man .PERIOD and  he  was  n't  there ,COMMA so  i  walked  all  afternoon  back .PERIOD so  i  had  another  unproductive  day .PERIOD so  while  i  was  sitting  in  a  tall  building  in  new  york ,COMMA i  put  those  two  experiences  together  side  by  side ,COMMA and  basically  concluded  that  connectivity  is  productivity ,COMMA whether  it  's  in  a  modern  office  or  an  underdeveloped  village .PERIOD so  naturally ,COMMA i ,COMMA the  implication  of  that  is  that  the  telephone  is  a  weapon  against  poverty .PERIOD and  if  that  's  the  case ,COMMA then  the  question  is  how  many  telephones  did  we  have  at  that  time ?QUESTIONMARK and  it  turns  out ,COMMA that  there  was  one  telephone  in  bangladesh  for  every  500  people .PERIOD and  all  those  phones  were  in  the  few  urban  places .PERIOD the  vast  rural  areas ,COMMA where  100  million  people  lived ,COMMA there  were  no  telephones .PERIOD so  just  imagine  how  many  man-months  or  man-years  are  wasted ,COMMA just  like  i  wasted  a  day .PERIOD if  you  just  multiply  by  100  million  people ,COMMA let  's  say  losing  one  day  a  month ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA and  you  see  a  vast  amount  of  resource  wasted .PERIOD and  after  all ,COMMA poor  countries ,COMMA like  rich  countries ,COMMA one  thing  we've  got  equal ,COMMA is  their  days  are  the  same  length ,COMMA 24  hours .PERIOD so  if  you  lose  that  precious  resource ,COMMA where  you  are  somewhat  equal  to  the  richer  countries ,COMMA that  's  a  huge  waste .PERIOD so  i  started  looking  for  any  evidence  that ,COMMA does  connectivity  really  increase  productivity ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  could  n't  find  much ,COMMA really ,COMMA but  i  found  this  graph  produced  by  the  itu ,COMMA which  is  the  international  telecommunication  union ,COMMA based  in  geneva .PERIOD they  show  an  interesting  thing .PERIOD that  you  see ,COMMA the  horizontal  axis  is  where  you  place  your  country .PERIOD so  the  united  states  or  the  uk  would  be  here ,COMMA outside .PERIOD and  so  the  impact  of  one  new  telephone ,COMMA which  is  on  the  vertical  axis ,COMMA is  very  little .PERIOD but  if  you  come  back  to  a  poorer  country ,COMMA where  the  gnp  per  capita  is ,COMMA let  's  say ,COMMA 500  dollars ,COMMA or  300  dollars ,COMMA then  the  impact  is  huge ,COMMA 6,000  dollars .PERIOD or  5,000  dollars .PERIOD the  question  was ,COMMA how  much  did  it  cost  to  install  a  new  telephone  in  bangladesh ?QUESTIONMARK it  turns  out ,COMMA 2,000  dollars .PERIOD so  if  you  spend  2,000  dollars ,COMMA and  let  's  say  the  telephone  lasts  10  years .PERIOD and  if  5,000  dollars  every  year ,COMMA so  that  's  50,000  dollars .PERIOD so  obviously  this  was  a  gadget  to  have .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA if  the  cost  of  installing  a  telephone  is  going  down ,COMMA because  there  's  a  digital  revolution  going  on ,COMMA then  it  would  be  even  more  dramatic .PERIOD and  i  knew  a  little  economics  by  then ,COMMA it  says  adam  smith  taught  us  that  specialization  leads  to  productivity .PERIOD but  how  would  you  specialize ?QUESTIONMARK let  's  say  i  'm  a  fisherman  and  a  farmer .PERIOD and  chris  is  a  fisherman  farmer .PERIOD both  are  generalists .PERIOD so  the  point  is  that  we  could  only ,COMMA the  only  way  we  could  depend  on  each  other ,COMMA is  if  we  can  connect  with  each  other .PERIOD and  if  we  are  neighbors ,COMMA i  could  just  walk  over  to  his  house .PERIOD but  then  we  are  limiting  our  economic  sphere  to  something  very  small  area .PERIOD but  in  order  to  expand  that ,COMMA you  need  a  river ,COMMA or  you  need  a  highway ,COMMA or  you  need  telephone  lines .PERIOD but  in  any  event ,COMMA it  's  connectivity  that  leads  to  dependability .PERIOD and  that  leads  to  specialization .PERIOD that  leads  to  productivity .PERIOD so  the  question  was ,COMMA i  started  looking  at  this  issue ,COMMA and  going  back  and  forth  between  bangladesh  and  new  york .PERIOD there  were  a  lot  of  reasons  people  told  me  why  we  do  n't  have  enough  telephones .PERIOD and  one  of  them  is  the  lacking  buying  power .PERIOD poor  people  apparently  do  n't  have  the  power  to  buy .PERIOD but  the  point  is ,COMMA if  it  's  a  production  tool ,COMMA why  do  we  have  to  worry  about  that ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA in  america ,COMMA people  buy  cars ,COMMA and  they  put  very  little  money  down .PERIOD they  get  a  car ,COMMA and  they  go  to  work .PERIOD the  work  pays  them  a  salary .PERIOD the  salary  allows  them  to  pay  for  the  car  over  time .PERIOD the  car  pays  for  itself .PERIOD so  if  the  telephone  is  a  production  tool ,COMMA then  we  do  n't  quite  have  to  worry  about  the  purchasing  power .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA even  if  that  's  true ,COMMA then  what  about  initial  buying  power ?QUESTIONMARK so  then  the  question  is ,COMMA why  cannot  we  have  some  kind  of  shared  access ?QUESTIONMARK in  the  united  states ,COMMA we  have ,COMMA everybody  needs  a  banking  service ,COMMA but  very  few  of  us  are  trying  to  buy  a  bank .PERIOD so  it  's ,COMMA a  bank  tends  to  serve  a  whole  community .PERIOD so  we  could  do  that  for  telephones .PERIOD and  also  people  told  me  that  we  have  a  lot  of  important  primary  needs  to  meet ,COMMA food ,COMMA clothing ,COMMA shelter ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD but  again ,COMMA it  's  very  paternalistic .PERIOD you  should  be  raising  income  and  let  people  decide  what  they  want  to  do  with  their  money .PERIOD but  the  real  problem  is  the  lack  of  other  infrastructures .PERIOD see ,COMMA you  need  some  kind  of  infrastructure  to  bring  a  new  thing .PERIOD for  instance ,COMMA the  internet  was  booming  in  the  us .PERIOD because  there  were ,COMMA there  were  people  who  had  computers .PERIOD they  had  modems .PERIOD they  had  telephone  lines ,COMMA so  it  's  very  easy  to  bring  in  a  new  idea ,COMMA like  the  internet .PERIOD but  that  's  what  's  lacking  in  a  poor  country .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA we  did  n't  have  ways  to  have  credit  checks ,COMMA few  banks  to  collect  bills ,COMMA etc .PERIOD but  that  's  why  i  noticed  grameen  bank ,COMMA which  is  a  bank  for  poor  people ,COMMA and  had  1,100  branches ,COMMA 12,000  employees ,COMMA 23  million  borrowers .PERIOD and  they  had  these  branches .PERIOD i  thought  i  could  put  cell  towers  and  create  a  network .PERIOD and  anyway ,COMMA to  cut  the  time  short ,COMMA so  i  started ,COMMA i  first  went  to  them  and  said ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA perhaps  i  could  connect  all  your  branches  and  make  you  more  efficient .PERIOD but  you  know ,COMMA they  have ,COMMA after  all ,COMMA evolved  in  a  country  without  telephones ,COMMA so  they  are  decentralized .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA of  course  there  might  be  other  good  reasons ,COMMA but  this  was  one  of  the  reasons ,COMMA they  had  to  be .PERIOD and  so  they  were  not  that  interested  to  connect  all  their  branches ,COMMA and  then  to  be ,COMMA and  rock  the  boat .PERIOD so  i  started  focusing .PERIOD what  is  it  that  they  really  do ?QUESTIONMARK so  what  happens  is  that  somebody  borrows  money  from  the  bank .PERIOD she  typically  buys  a  cow .PERIOD the  cow  gives  milk .PERIOD and  she  sells  the  milk  to  the  villagers ,COMMA and  pays  off  the  loan .PERIOD and  this  is  a  business  for  her ,COMMA but  it  's  milk  for  everybody  else .PERIOD and  suddenly  i  realized  that  a  cell  phone  could  be  a  cow .PERIOD because  some  way  she  could  borrow  200  dollars  from  the  bank ,COMMA get  a  phone  and  have  the  phone  for  everybody .PERIOD and  it  's  a  business  for  her .PERIOD so  i  wrote  to  the  bank ,COMMA and  they  thought  for  a  while ,COMMA and  they  said ,COMMA it  's  a  little  crazy ,COMMA but  logical .PERIOD if  you  think  it  can  be  done ,COMMA come  and  make  it  happen .PERIOD so  i  quit  my  job .PERIOD i  went  back  to  bangladesh .PERIOD i  created  a  company  in  america  called  gonofone ,COMMA which  in  bengali  means  people  's  phone .PERIOD and  angel  investors  in  america  put  in  money  into  that .PERIOD i  flew  around  the  world .PERIOD after  about  a  million ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA i  got  rejected  from  lots  of  places ,COMMA because  i  was  not  only  trying  to  go  to  a  poor  country ,COMMA i  was  trying  to  go  to  the  poor  of  the  poor  country .PERIOD after  about  a  million  miles ,COMMA and  a  meaningful ,COMMA a  substantial  loss  of  hair ,COMMA i  eventually  put  together  a  consortium ,COMMA and ,COMMA which  involved  the  norwegian  telephone  company ,COMMA which  provided  the  know-how ,COMMA and  the  grameen  bank  provided  the  infrastructure  to  spread  the  service .PERIOD to  make  the  story  short ,COMMA here  is  the  coverage  of  the  country .PERIOD you  can  see  it  's  pretty  much  covered .PERIOD even  in  bangladesh ,COMMA there  are  some  empty  places .PERIOD but  we  are  also  investing  around  another  300  million  dollars  this  year  to  extend  that  coverage .PERIOD now ,COMMA about  that  cow  model  i  talked  about .PERIOD there  are  about  115,000  people  who  are  retailing  telephone  services  in  their  neighborhoods .PERIOD and  it  's  serving  52,000  villages ,COMMA which  represent  about  80  million  people .PERIOD and  these  phones  are  generating  about  100  million  dollars  for  the  company .PERIOD and  two  dollars  profit  per  entrepreneur  per  day ,COMMA which  is  like  700  dollars  per  year .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA it  's  very  beneficial  in  a  lot  of  ways .PERIOD it  increases  income ,COMMA improves  welfare ,COMMA etc .PERIOD and  the  result  is ,COMMA right  now ,COMMA this  company  is  the  largest  telephone  company ,COMMA with  35  million  subscribers .PERIOD 115,000  of  these  phones  i  talked  about ,COMMA that  produces  about  a  third  of  the  traffic  in  the  network .PERIOD and  2004 ,COMMA the  net  profit ,COMMA after  taxes ,COMMA very  serious  taxes ,COMMA was  120  million  dollars .PERIOD and  the  company  contributed  about  190  million  dollars  to  the  government  coffers .PERIOD and  again ,COMMA here  are  some  of  the  lessons .PERIOD the  government  needs  to  provide  economically  viable  services .PERIOD actually ,COMMA this  is  an  instance  where  private  companies  can  provide  that .PERIOD governments  need  to  subsidize  private  companies .PERIOD this  is  what  some  people  think .PERIOD and  actually ,COMMA private  companies  help  governments  with  taxes .PERIOD poor  people  are  recipients .PERIOD poor  people  are  a  resource .PERIOD services  cost  too  much  for  the  poor .PERIOD their  involvement  reduces  the  cost .PERIOD the  poor  are  uneducated  and  cannot  do  much .PERIOD they  are  very  eager  learners  and  very  capable  survivors .PERIOD i've  been  very  surprised .PERIOD most  of  them  learn  how  to  operate  a  telephone  within  a  day .PERIOD poor  countries  need  aid .PERIOD businesses ,COMMA this  one  company  has  raised  the ,COMMA if  the  ideal  figures  are  even  five  percent  true ,COMMA this  one  company  is  raising  the  gnp  of  the  country  much  more  than  the  aid  the  country  receives .PERIOD and  as  i  was  trying  to  show  you ,COMMA as  far  as  i  'm  concerned ,COMMA aid  does  damages  because  it  removes  the  government  from  its  citizens .PERIOD and  this  is  a  new  project  i  have  with  dean  kamen ,COMMA the  famous  inventor  in  america .PERIOD he  has  produced  some  power  generators ,COMMA which  we  are  now  doing  an  experiment  in  bangladesh ,COMMA in  two  villages  where  cow  manure  is  producing  biogas ,COMMA which  is  running  these  generators .PERIOD and  each  of  these  generators  is  selling  electricity  to  20  houses  each .PERIOD it  's  just  an  experiment .PERIOD we  do  n't  know  how  far  it  will  go ,COMMA but  it  's  going  on .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD how  many  of  you  had  to  fill  out  some  sort  of  web  form  where  you've  been  asked  to  read  a  distorted  sequence  of  characters  like  this ?QUESTIONMARK how  many  of  you  found  it  really ,COMMA really  annoying ?QUESTIONMARK okay ,COMMA outstanding .PERIOD so  i  invented  that .PERIOD or  i  was  one  of  the  people  who  did  it .PERIOD that  thing  is  called  a  captcha .PERIOD and  the  reason  it  is  there  is  to  make  sure  you ,COMMA the  entity  filling  out  the  form ,COMMA are  actually  a  human  and  not  some  sort  of  computer  program  that  was  written  to  submit  the  form  millions  and  millions  of  times .PERIOD the  reason  it  works  is  because  humans ,COMMA at  least  non-visually-impaired  humans ,COMMA have  no  trouble  reading  these  distorted  squiggly  characters ,COMMA whereas  computer  programs  simply  cannot  do  it  as  well  yet .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA in  the  case  of  ticketmaster ,COMMA the  reason  you  have  to  type  these  distorted  characters  is  to  prevent  scalpers  from  writing  a  program  that  can  buy  millions  of  tickets ,COMMA two  at  a  time .PERIOD captchas  are  used  all  over  the  internet .PERIOD and  since  they  're  used  so  often ,COMMA a  lot  of  times  the  precise  sequence  of  random  characters  that  is  shown  to  the  user  is  not  so  fortunate .PERIOD so  this  is  an  example  from  the  yahoo  registration  page .PERIOD the  random  characters  that  happened  to  be  shown  to  the  user  were  w ,COMMA a ,COMMA i ,COMMA t ,COMMA which ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA spell  a  word .PERIOD but  the  best  part  is  the  message  that  the  yahoo  help  desk  got  about  20  minutes  later .PERIOD text ,COMMA help .PERIOD i've  been  waiting  for  over  20  minutes ,COMMA and  nothing  happens .PERIOD this  person  thought  they  needed  to  wait .PERIOD this  of  course ,COMMA is  not  as  bad  as  this  poor  person .PERIOD captcha  project  is  something  that  we  did  here  at  carnegie  melllon  over  10  years  ago ,COMMA and  it  's  been  used  everywhere .PERIOD let  me  now  tell  you  about  a  project  that  we  did  a  few  years  later ,COMMA which  is  sort  of  the  next  evolution  of  captcha .PERIOD this  is  a  project  that  we  call  recaptcha ,COMMA which  is  something  that  we  started  here  at  carnegie  mellon ,COMMA then  we  turned  it  into  a  startup  company .PERIOD and  then  about  a  year  and  a  half  ago ,COMMA google  actually  acquired  this  company .PERIOD so  let  me  tell  you  what  this  project  started .PERIOD so  this  project  started  from  the  following  realization ,COMMA it  turns  out  that  approximately  200  million  captchas  are  typed  everyday  by  people  around  the  world .PERIOD when  i  first  heard  this ,COMMA i  was  quite  proud  of  myself .PERIOD i  thought ,COMMA look  at  the  impact  that  my  research  has  had .PERIOD but  then  i  started  feeling  bad .PERIOD see  here  's  the  thing ,COMMA each  time  you  type  a  captcha ,COMMA essentially  you  waste  10  seconds  of  your  time .PERIOD and  if  you  multiply  that  by  200  million ,COMMA you  get  that  humanity  as  a  whole  is  wasting  about  500,000  hours  every  day  typing  these  annoying  captchas .PERIOD so  then  i  started  feeling  bad .PERIOD and  then  i  started  thinking ,COMMA well ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA we  cannot  just  get  rid  of  captchas ,COMMA because  the  security  of  the  web  sort  of  depends  on  them .PERIOD but  then  i  started  thinking ,COMMA is  there  any  way  we  can  use  this  effort  for  something  that  is  good  for  humanity ?QUESTIONMARK while  you  're  typing  a  captcha ,COMMA during  those  10  seconds ,COMMA your  brain  is  doing  something  amazing .PERIOD your  brain  is  doing  something  that  computers  cannot  yet  do .PERIOD so  can  we  get  you  to  do  useful  work  for  those  10  seconds ?QUESTIONMARK is  there  some  humongous  problem  that  we  cannot  yet  get  computers  to  solve ,COMMA yet  we  can  split  into  tiny  10-second  chunks  such  that  each  time  somebody  solves  a  captcha  they  solve  a  little  bit  of  this  problem ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  answer  to  that  is  yes ,COMMA and  this  is  what  we  're  doing  now .PERIOD so  what  you  may  not  know  is  that  nowadays  while  you  're  typing  a  captcha ,COMMA not  only  are  you  authenticating  yourself  as  a  human ,COMMA but  in  addition  you  're  actually  helping  us  to  digitize  books .PERIOD so  let  me  explain  how  this  works .PERIOD so  there  's  a  lot  of  projects  out  there  trying  to  digitize  books .PERIOD google  has  one .PERIOD the  internet  archive  has  one .PERIOD amazon ,COMMA now  with  the  kindle ,COMMA is  trying  to  digitize  books .PERIOD basically  the  way  this  works  is  you  start  with  an  old  book .PERIOD you've  seen  those  things ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK like  a  book ?QUESTIONMARK so  you  start  with  a  book ,COMMA and  then  you  scan  it .PERIOD now  scanning  a  book  is  like  taking  a  digital  photograph  of  every  page  of  the  book .PERIOD it  gives  you  an  image  for  every  page  of  the  book .PERIOD this  is  an  image  with  text  for  every  page  of  the  book .PERIOD the  next  step  in  the  process  is  that  the  computer  needs  to  be  able  to  decipher  all  of  the  words  in  this  image .PERIOD that  's  using  a  technology  called  ocr ,COMMA for  optical  character  recognition ,COMMA which  takes  a  picture  of  text  and  tries  to  figure  out  what  text  is  in  there .PERIOD now  the  problem  is  that  ocr  is  not  perfect .PERIOD especially  for  older  books  where  the  ink  has  faded  and  the  pages  have  turned  yellow ,COMMA ocr  cannot  recognize  a  lot  of  the  words .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA for  things  that  were  written  more  than  50  years  ago ,COMMA the  computer  cannot  recognize  about  30  percent  of  the  words .PERIOD is  we  're  taking  all  of  the  words  that  the  computer  cannot  recognize  and  we  're  getting  people  to  read  them  for  us  while  they  're  typing  a  captcha  on  the  internet .PERIOD so  the  next  time  you  type  a  captcha ,COMMA these  words  that  you  're  typing  are  actually  words  that  are  coming  from  books  that  are  being  digitized  that  the  computer  could  not  recognize .PERIOD and  now  the  reason  we  have  two  words  nowadays  instead  of  one  is  because ,COMMA you  see ,COMMA one  of  the  words  is  a  word  that  the  system  just  got  out  of  a  book ,COMMA it  did  n't  know  what  it  was ,COMMA and  it  's  going  to  present  it  to  you .PERIOD but  since  it  does  n't  know  the  answer  for  it ,COMMA it  cannot  grade  it  for  you .PERIOD so  what  we  do  is  we  give  you  another  word ,COMMA one  for  which  the  system  does  know  the  answer .PERIOD we  do  n't  tell  you  which  one  's  which ,COMMA and  we  say ,COMMA please  type  both .PERIOD and  if  you  type  the  correct  word  for  the  one  for  which  the  system  already  knows  the  answer ,COMMA it  assumes  you  are  human ,COMMA and  it  also  gets  some  confidence  that  you  typed  the  other  word  correctly .PERIOD and  if  we  repeat  this  process  to  like  10  different  people  and  all  of  them  agree  on  what  the  new  word  is ,COMMA then  we  get  one  more  word  digitized  accurately .PERIOD so  this  is  how  the  system  works .PERIOD and  basically ,COMMA since  we  released  it  about  three  or  four  years  ago ,COMMA a  lot  of  websites  have  started  switching  from  the  old  captcha  where  people  wasted  their  time  to  the  new  captcha  where  people  are  helping  to  digitize  books .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA ticketmaster .PERIOD so  every  time  you  buy  tickets  on  ticketmaster ,COMMA you  help  to  digitize  a  book .PERIOD facebook ,COMMA every  time  you  add  a  friend  or  poke  somebody ,COMMA you  help  to  digitize  a  book .PERIOD twitter  and  about  350,000  other  sites  are  all  using  recaptcha .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA the  number  of  sites  that  are  using  recaptcha  is  so  high  that  the  number  of  words  that  we  're  digitizing  per  day  is  really ,COMMA really  large .PERIOD it  's  about  100  million  a  day ,COMMA which  is  the  equivalent  of  about  two  and  a  half  million  books  a  year .PERIOD and  this  is  all  being  done  one  word  at  a  time  by  just  people  typing  captchas  on  the  internet .PERIOD now  of  course ,COMMA since  we  're  doing  so  many  words  per  day ,COMMA funny  things  can  happen .PERIOD and  this  is  especially  true  because  now  we  're  giving  people  two  randomly  chosen  english  words  next  to  each  other .PERIOD so  funny  things  can  happen .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA we  presented  this  word .PERIOD it  's  the  word  christians .PERIOD there  's  nothing  wrong  with  it .PERIOD but  if  you  present  it  along  with  another  randomly  chosen  word ,COMMA bad  things  can  happen .PERIOD so  we  get  this .PERIOD but  it  's  even  worse ,COMMA because  the  particular  website  where  we  showed  this  actually  happened  to  be  called  the  embassy  of  the  kingdom  of  god .PERIOD oops .PERIOD here  's  another  really  bad  one .PERIOD johnedwardscom  so  we  keep  on  insulting  people  left  and  right  everyday .PERIOD now ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA we  're  not  just  insulting  people .PERIOD see  here  's  the  thing ,COMMA since  we  're  presenting  two  randomly  chosen  words ,COMMA interesting  things  can  happen .PERIOD so  this  actually  has  given  rise  to  a  really  big  internet  meme  that  tens  of  thousands  of  people  have  participated  in ,COMMA which  is  called  captcha  art .PERIOD i  'm  sure  some  of  you  have  heard  about  it .PERIOD here  's  how  it  works .PERIOD imagine  you  're  using  the  internet  and  you  see  a  captcha  that  you  think  is  somewhat  peculiar ,COMMA like  this  captcha .PERIOD then  what  you  're  supposed  to  do  is  you  take  a  screen  shot  of  it .PERIOD then  of  course ,COMMA you  fill  out  the  captcha  because  you  help  us  digitize  a  book .PERIOD but  then ,COMMA first  you  take  a  screen  shot ,COMMA and  then  you  draw  something  that  is  related  to  it .PERIOD that  's  how  it  works .PERIOD there  are  tens  of  thousands  of  these .PERIOD some  of  them  are  very  cute .PERIOD some  of  them  are  funnier .PERIOD and  some  of  them ,COMMA like  paleontological  shvisle ,COMMA they  contain  snoop  dogg .PERIOD okay ,COMMA so  this  is  my  favorite  number  of  recaptcha .PERIOD so  this  is  the  favorite  thing  that  i  like  about  this  whole  project .PERIOD this  is  the  number  of  distinct  people  that  have  helped  us  digitize  at  least  one  word  out  of  a  book  through  recaptcha ,COMMA 750  million ,COMMA which  is  a  little  over  10  percent  of  the  world  's  population ,COMMA has  helped  us  digitize  human  knowledge .PERIOD and  it  is  numbers  like  these  that  motivate  my  research  agenda .PERIOD so  the  question  that  motivates  my  research  is  the  following ,COMMA if  you  look  at  humanity  's  large-scale  achievements ,COMMA these  really  big  things  that  humanity  has  gotten  together  and  done  historically ,COMMA like  for  example ,COMMA building  the  pyramids  of  egypt  or  the  panama  canal  or  putting  a  man  on  the  moon ,COMMA there  is  a  curious  fact  about  them ,COMMA and  it  is  that  they  were  all  done  with  about  the  same  number  off  people .PERIOD it  's  weird .PERIOD they  were  all  done  with  about  100,000  people .PERIOD and  the  reason  for  that  is  because ,COMMA before  the  internet ,COMMA coordinating  more  than  100,000  people ,COMMA let  alone  paying  them ,COMMA was  essentially  impossible .PERIOD but  now  with  the  internet ,COMMA i've  just  shown  you  a  project  where  we've  gotten  750  million  people  to  help  us  digitize  human  knowledge .PERIOD so  the  question  that  motivates  my  research  is ,COMMA if  we  can  put  a  man  on  the  moon  with  100,000 ,COMMA what  can  we  do  with  100  million ?QUESTIONMARK so  based  on  this  question ,COMMA we've  had  a  lot  of  different  projects  that  we've  been  working  on .PERIOD let  me  tell  you  about  one  that  i  'm  most  excited  about .PERIOD this  is  something  that  we've  been  semi-quietly  working  on  for  the  last  year  and  a  half  or  so .PERIOD it  has  n't  yet  been  launched .PERIOD it  's  called  duolingo .PERIOD since  it  has  n't  been  launched ,COMMA shhhhh .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA i  can  trust  you  'll  do  that .PERIOD so  this  is  the  project .PERIOD here  's  how  it  started .PERIOD it  started  with  me  posing  a  question  to  my  graduate  student ,COMMA severin  hacker .PERIOD okay ,COMMA that  's  severin  hacker .PERIOD so  i  posed  the  question  to  my  graduate  student .PERIOD by  the  way ,COMMA you  did  hear  me  correctly .PERIOD his  last  name  is  hacker .PERIOD so  i  posed  this  question  to  him ,COMMA how  can  we  get  100  million  people  translating  the  web  into  every  major  language  for  free ?QUESTIONMARK okay ,COMMA so  there  's  a  lot  of  things  to  say  about  this  question .PERIOD first  of  all ,COMMA translating  the  web .PERIOD so  right  now  the  web  is  partitioned  into  multiple  languages .PERIOD a  large  fraction  of  it  is  in  english .PERIOD if  you  do  n't  know  any  english ,COMMA you  cannot  access  it .PERIOD but  there  's  large  fractions  in  other  different  languages ,COMMA and  if  you  do  n't  know  those  languages ,COMMA you  cannot  access  it .PERIOD so  i  would  like  to  translate  all  of  the  web ,COMMA or  at  least  most  of  the  web ,COMMA into  every  major  language .PERIOD so  that  's  what  i  would  like  to  do .PERIOD now  some  of  you  may  say ,COMMA why  cannot  we  use  computers  to  translate ?QUESTIONMARK why  cannot  we  use  machine  translation ?QUESTIONMARK machine  translation  nowadays  is  starting  to  translate  some  sentences  here  and  there .PERIOD why  cannot  we  use  it  to  translate  the  whole  web ?QUESTIONMARK well  the  problem  with  that  is  that  it  's  not  yet  good  enough  and  it  probably  wo  n't  be  for  the  next  15  to  20  years .PERIOD it  makes  a  lot  of  mistakes .PERIOD even  when  it  does  n't  make  a  mistake ,COMMA since  it  makes  so  many  mistakes ,COMMA you  do  n't  know  whether  to  trust  it  or  not .PERIOD so  let  me  show  you  an  example  of  something  that  was  translated  with  a  machine .PERIOD actually  it  was  a  forum  post .PERIOD it  was  somebody  who  was  trying  to  ask  a  question  about  javascript .PERIOD it  was  translated  from  japanese  into  english .PERIOD so  i  'll  just  let  you  read .PERIOD this  person  starts  apologizing  for  the  fact  that  it  's  translated  with  a  computer .PERIOD so  the  next  sentence  is  is  going  to  be  the  preamble  to  the  question .PERIOD so  he  's  just  explaining  something .PERIOD remember ,COMMA it  's  a  question  about  javascript .PERIOD then  comes  the  first  part  of  the  question .PERIOD then  comes  my  favorite  part  of  the  question .PERIOD and  then  comes  the  ending ,COMMA which  is  my  favorite  part  of  the  whole  thing .PERIOD okay ,COMMA so  computer  translation ,COMMA not  yet  good  enough .PERIOD so  back  to  the  question .PERIOD so  we  need  people  to  translate  the  whole  web .PERIOD so  now  the  next  question  you  may  have  is ,COMMA well  why  cannot  we  just  pay  people  to  do  this ?QUESTIONMARK we  could  pay  professional  language  translators  to  translate  the  whole  web .PERIOD we  could  do  that .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA it  would  be  extremely  expensive .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA translating  a  tiny ,COMMA tiny  fraction  of  the  whole  web ,COMMA wikipedia ,COMMA into  one  other  language ,COMMA spanish .PERIOD wikipedia  exists  in  spanish ,COMMA but  it  's  very  small  compared  to  the  size  of  english .PERIOD it  's  about  20  percent  of  the  size  of  english .PERIOD if  we  wanted  to  translate  the  other  80  percent  into  spanish ,COMMA it  would  cost  at  least  50  million  dollars ,COMMA and  this  is  at  even  the  most  exploited ,COMMA outsourcing  country  out  there .PERIOD so  it  would  be  very  expensive .PERIOD so  what  we  want  to  do  is  we  want  to  get  100  million  people  translating  the  web  into  every  major  language  for  free .PERIOD now  if  this  is  what  you  want  to  do ,COMMA you  pretty  quickly  realize  you  're  going  to  run  into  two  pretty  big  hurdles ,COMMA two  big  obstacles .PERIOD the  first  one  is  a  lack  of  bilinguals .PERIOD so  i  do  n't  even  know  if  there  exists  100  million  people  out  there  using  the  web  who  are  bilingual  enough  to  help  us  translate .PERIOD that  's  a  big  problem .PERIOD the  other  problem  you  're  going  to  run  into  is  a  lack  of  motivation .PERIOD how  are  we  going  to  motivate  people  to  actually  translate  the  web  for  free ?QUESTIONMARK normally ,COMMA you  have  to  pay  people  to  do  this .PERIOD so  how  are  we  going  to  motivate  them  to  do  it  for  free ?QUESTIONMARK now  when  we  were  starting  to  think  about  this ,COMMA we  were  blocked  by  these  two  things .PERIOD but  then  we  realized ,COMMA there  's  actually  a  way  to  solve  both  these  problems  with  the  same  solution .PERIOD there  's  a  way  to  kill  two  birds  with  one  stone .PERIOD and  that  is  to  transform  language  translation  into  something  that  millions  of  people  want  to  do ,COMMA and  that  also  helps  with  the  problem  of  lack  of  bilinguals ,COMMA and  that  is  language  education .PERIOD so  it  turns  out  that  today ,COMMA there  are  over  12  billion  people  learning  a  foreign  language .PERIOD people  really ,COMMA really  want  to  learn  a  foreign  language .PERIOD and  it  's  not  just  because  they  're  being  forced  to  do  so  in  school .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA in  the  united  states  alone ,COMMA there  are  over  five  million  people  who  have  paid  over  $500  for  software  to  learn  a  new  language .PERIOD so  people  really ,COMMA really  want  to  learn  a  new  language .PERIOD so  what  we've  been  working  on  for  the  last  year  and  a  half  is  a  new  website ,COMMA it  's  called  duolingo ,COMMA where  the  basic  idea  is  people  learn  a  new  language  for  free  while  simultaneously  translating  the  web .PERIOD and  so  basically  they  're  learning  by  doing .PERIOD so  the  way  this  works  is  whenever  you  're  a  just  a  beginner ,COMMA we  give  you  very ,COMMA very  simple  sentences .PERIOD there  's ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA a  lot  of  very  simple  sentences  on  the  web .PERIOD we  give  you  very ,COMMA very  simple  sentences  along  with  what  each  word  means .PERIOD and  as  you  translate  them ,COMMA and  as  you  see  how  other  people  translate  them ,COMMA you  start  learning  the  language .PERIOD and  as  you  get  more  and  more  advanced ,COMMA we  give  you  more  and  more  complex  sentences  to  translate .PERIOD but  at  all  times ,COMMA you  're  learning  by  doing .PERIOD now  the  crazy  thing  about  this  method  is  that  it  actually  really  works .PERIOD first  of  all ,COMMA people  are  really ,COMMA really  learning  a  language .PERIOD we  're  mostly  done  building  it ,COMMA and  now  we  're  testing  it .PERIOD people  really  can  learn  a  language  with  it .PERIOD and  they  learn  it  about  as  well  as  the  leading  language  learning  software .PERIOD so  people  really  do  learn  a  language .PERIOD and  not  only  do  they  learn  it  as  well ,COMMA but  actually  it  's  way  more  interesting .PERIOD because  you  see  with  duolingo ,COMMA people  are  actually  learning  with  real  content .PERIOD as  opposed  to  learning  with  made-up  sentences ,COMMA people  are  learning  with  real  content ,COMMA which  is  inherently  interesting .PERIOD so  people  really  do  learn  a  language .PERIOD but  perhaps  more  surprisingly ,COMMA the  translations  that  we  get  from  people  using  the  site ,COMMA even  though  they  're  just  beginners ,COMMA the  translations  that  we  get  are  as  accurate  as  those  of  professional  language  translators ,COMMA which  is  very  surprising .PERIOD so  let  me  show  you  one  example .PERIOD this  is  a  sentence  that  was  translated  from  german  into  english .PERIOD the  top  is  the  german .PERIOD the  middle  is  an  english  translation  that  was  done  by  somebody  who  was  a  professional  english  translator  who  we  paid  20  cents  a  word  for  this  translation .PERIOD and  the  bottom  is  a  translation  by  users  of  duolingo ,COMMA none  of  whom  knew  any  german  before  they  started  using  the  site .PERIOD you  can  see ,COMMA it  's  pretty  much  perfect .PERIOD now  of  course ,COMMA we  play  a  trick  here  to  make  the  translations  as  good  as  professional  language  translators .PERIOD we  combine  the  translations  of  multiple  beginners  to  get  the  quality  of  a  single  professional  translator .PERIOD now  even  though  we  're  combining  the  translations ,COMMA the  site  actually  can  translate  pretty  fast .PERIOD so  let  me  show  you ,COMMA this  is  our  estimates  of  how  fast  we  could  translate  wikipedia  from  english  into  spanish .PERIOD remember ,COMMA this  is  50  million  dollars-worth  of  value .PERIOD so  if  we  wanted  to  translate  wikipedia  into  spanish ,COMMA we  could  do  it  in  five  weeks  with  100,000  active  users .PERIOD and  we  could  do  it  in  about  80  hours  with  a  million  active  users .PERIOD since  all  the  projects  that  my  group  has  worked  on  so  far  have  gotten  millions  of  users ,COMMA we  're  hopeful  that  we  'll  be  able  to  translate  extremely  fast  with  this  project .PERIOD now  the  thing  that  i  'm  most  excited  about  with  duolingo  is  i  think  this  provides  a  fair  business  model  for  language  education .PERIOD so  here  's  the  thing ,COMMA the  current  business  model  for  language  education  is  the  student  pays ,COMMA and  in  particular ,COMMA the  student  pays  rosetta  stone  500  dollars .PERIOD that  's  the  current  business  model .PERIOD the  problem  with  this  business  model  is  that  95  percent  of  the  world  's  population  does  n't  have  500  dollars .PERIOD so  it  's  extremely  unfair  towards  the  poor .PERIOD this  is  totally  biased  towards  the  rich .PERIOD now  see ,COMMA in  duolingo ,COMMA because  while  you  learn  you  're  actually  creating  value ,COMMA you  're  translating  stuff ,COMMA which  for  example ,COMMA we  could  charge  somebody  for  translations .PERIOD so  this  is  how  we  could  monetize  this .PERIOD since  people  are  creating  value  while  they  're  learning ,COMMA they  do  n't  have  to  pay  their  money ,COMMA they  pay  with  their  time .PERIOD but  the  magical  thing  here  is  that  they  're  paying  with  their  time ,COMMA but  that  is  time  that  would  have  had  to  have  been  spent  anyways  learning  the  language .PERIOD so  the  nice  thing  about  duolingo  is  i  think  it  provides  a  fair  business  model ,COMMA one  that  does  n't  discriminate  against  poor  people .PERIOD so  here  's  the  site .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD so  here  's  the  site .PERIOD we  have  n't  yet  launched ,COMMA but  if  you  go  there ,COMMA you  can  sign  up  to  be  part  of  our  private  beta ,COMMA which  is  probably  going  to  start  in  about  three  or  four  weeks .PERIOD we  have  n't  yet  launched  this  duolingo .PERIOD by  the  way ,COMMA i  'm  the  one  talking  here ,COMMA but  actually  duolingo  is  the  work  of  a  really  awesome  team ,COMMA some  of  whom  are  here .PERIOD so  thank  you .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  talk  about  a  very  fundamental  change  that  is  going  on  in  the  very  fabric  of  the  modern  economy .PERIOD and  to  talk  about  that ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  go  back  to  the  beginning ,COMMA because  in  the  beginning  were  commodities .PERIOD commodities  are  things  that  you  grow  in  the  ground ,COMMA raise  on  the  ground  or  pull  out  of  the  ground ,COMMA basically ,COMMA animal ,COMMA mineral ,COMMA vegetable .PERIOD and  then  you  extract  them  out  of  the  ground ,COMMA and  sell  them  on  the  open  marketplace .PERIOD commodities  were  the  basis  of  the  agrarian  economy  that  lasted  for  millennia .PERIOD but  then  along  came  the  industrial  revolution ,COMMA and  then  goods  became  the  predominant  economic  offering ,COMMA where  we  used  commodities  as  a  raw  material  to  be  able  to  make  or  manufacture  goods .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  moved  from  an  agrarian  economy  to  an  industrial  economy .PERIOD well ,COMMA what  then  happened  over  the  last  50  or  60  years ,COMMA is  that  goods  have  become  commoditized .PERIOD commoditized ,COMMA where  they  're  treated  like  a  commodity ,COMMA where  people  do  n't  care  who  makes  them .PERIOD they  just  care  about  three  things  and  three  things  only ,COMMA price ,COMMA price  and  price .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  's  an  antidote  to  commoditization ,COMMA and  that  is  customization .PERIOD my  first  book  was  called  mass  customization ,COMMA it  came  up  a  couple  of  times  yesterday ,COMMA and  how  i  discovered  this  progression  of  economic  value  was  realizing  that  customizing  a  good  automatically  turned  it  into  a  service ,COMMA because  it  was  done  just  for  a  particular  person ,COMMA because  it  was  n't  inventoried ,COMMA it  was  delivered  on  demand  to  that  individual  person .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  moved  from  an  industrial  economy  to  a  service-based  economy .PERIOD but  over  the  past  10  or  20  years ,COMMA what  's  happened  is  that  services  are  being  commoditized  as  well .PERIOD long-distance  telephone  service  sold  on  price ,COMMA price ,COMMA price .PERIOD fast-food  restaurants  with  all  their  value  pricing .PERIOD and  even  the  internet  is  commoditizing  not  just  goods ,COMMA but  services  as  well .PERIOD what  that  means  is  that  it  's  time  to  move  to  a  new  level  of  economic  value .PERIOD time  to  go  beyond  the  goods  and  the  services ,COMMA and  use ,COMMA in  that  same  heuristic ,COMMA what  happens  when  you  customize  a  service ?QUESTIONMARK what  happens  when  you  design  a  service  that  is  so  appropriate  for  a  particular  person ,COMMA that  's  exactly  what  they  need  at  this  moment  in  time ?QUESTIONMARK then  you  cannot  help  but  make  them  go  wow .PERIOD you  cannot  help  but  turn  it  into  a  memorable  event ,COMMA you  cannot  help  but  turn  it  into  an  experience .PERIOD so  we  're  shifting  to  an  experience  economy ,COMMA where  experiences  are  becoming  the  predominant  economic  offering .PERIOD now  most  places  that  i  talk  to ,COMMA when  i  talk  about  experience ,COMMA i  talk  about  disney ,COMMA the  world  's  premier  experience-stager .PERIOD i  talk  about  theme  restaurants ,COMMA and  experiential  retail ,COMMA and  boutique  hotels ,COMMA and  las  vegas ,COMMA the  experience  capital  of  the  world .PERIOD but  here ,COMMA when  you  think  about  experiences ,COMMA think  about  thomas  dolby  and  his  group ,COMMA playing  music .PERIOD think  about  meaningful  places .PERIOD think  about  drinking  wine ,COMMA about  a  journey  to  the  clock  of  the  long  now .PERIOD those  are  all  experiences .PERIOD think  about  ted  itself .PERIOD the  experience  capital  in  the  world  of  conferences .PERIOD all  of  these  are  experiences .PERIOD now ,COMMA over  the  last  several  years  i  spent  a  lot  of  time  in  europe ,COMMA and  particularly  in  the  netherlands ,COMMA and  whenever  i  talk  about  the  experience  economy  there ,COMMA i  'm  always  greeted  at  the  end  with  one  particular  question ,COMMA almost  invariably .PERIOD and  the  question  is  n't  really  so  much  a  question  as  an  accusation .PERIOD and  the  dutch ,COMMA when  they  usually  put  it ,COMMA it  always  starts  with  the  same  two  words .PERIOD you  know  the  words  i  mean ?QUESTIONMARK you  americans .PERIOD they  say ,COMMA you  americans .PERIOD you  like  your  fantasy  environments ,COMMA your  fake ,COMMA your  disneyland  experiences .PERIOD they  say ,COMMA we  dutch ,COMMA we  like  real ,COMMA natural ,COMMA authentic  experiences .PERIOD so  much  has  that  happened  that  i've  developed  a  fairly  praticed  response ,COMMA which  is ,COMMA i  point  out  that  first  of  all ,COMMA you  have  to  understand  that  there  is  no  such  thing  as  an  inauthentic  experience .PERIOD why ?QUESTIONMARK because  the  experience  happens  inside  of  us .PERIOD it  's  our  reaction  to  the  events  that  are  staged  in  front  of  us .PERIOD so ,COMMA as  long  as  we  are  in  any  sense  authentic  human  beings ,COMMA then  every  experience  we  have  is  authentic .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  may  be  more  or  less  natural  or  artificial  stimuli  for  the  experience ,COMMA but  even  that  is  a  matter  of  degree ,COMMA not  kind .PERIOD and  there  's  no  such  thing  as  a  100  percent  natural  experience .PERIOD even  if  you  go  for  a  walk  in  the  proverbial  woods ,COMMA there  is  a  company  that  manufactured  the  car  that  delivered  you  to  the  edge  of  the  woods .PERIOD there  's  a  company  that  manufactured  the  shoes  that  you  have  to  protect  yourself  from  the  ground  of  the  woods .PERIOD there  's  a  company  that  provides  a  cell  phone  service  you  have  in  case  you  get  lost  in  the  woods .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK all  of  those  are  man-made ,COMMA artificiality  brought  into  the  woods  by  you ,COMMA and  by  the  very  nature  of  being  there .PERIOD and  then  i  always  finish  off  by  talking  about ,COMMA the  thing  that  amazes  me  the  most  about  this  question ,COMMA particularly  coming  from  the  dutch ,COMMA is  that  the  netherlands  is  every  bit  as  manufactured  as  disneyland .PERIOD and  the  dutch ,COMMA they  always  go .PERIOD and  they  realize ,COMMA i  'm  right .PERIOD there  is  n't  a  square  meter  of  ground  in  the  entire  country  that  has  n't  been  reclaimed  from  the  sea ,COMMA or  otherwise  moved ,COMMA modified  and  manicured  to  look  as  if  it  had  always  been  there .PERIOD it  's  the  only  place  you  ever  go  for  a  walk  in  the  woods  and  all  the  trees  are  lined  up  in  rows .PERIOD but  nonetheless ,COMMA not  just  the  dutch ,COMMA but  everyone  has  this  desire  for  the  authentic .PERIOD and  authenticity  is  therefore  becoming  the  new  consumer  sensibility ,COMMA the  buying  criteria  by  which  consumers  are  choosing  who  are  they  going  to  buy  from ,COMMA and  what  they  're  going  to  buy .PERIOD becoming  the  basis  of  the  economy .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA you  can  look  at  how  each  of  these  economies  developed ,COMMA that  each  one  has  their  own  business  imperative ,COMMA matched  with  a  consumer  sensibility .PERIOD we  're  the  agrarian  economy ,COMMA and  we  're  supplying  commodities .PERIOD it  's  about  supply  and  availability .PERIOD getting  the  commodities  to  market .PERIOD with  the  industrial  economy ,COMMA it  is  about  controlling  costs ,COMMA getting  the  costs  down  as  low  as  possible  so  we  can  offer  them  to  the  masses .PERIOD with  the  service  economy ,COMMA it  is  about  improving  quality .PERIOD that  has ,COMMA the  whole  quality  movement  has  risen  with  the  service  economy  over  the  past  20  or  30  years .PERIOD and  now ,COMMA with  the  experience  economy ,COMMA it  's  about  rendering  authenticity .PERIOD rendering  authenticity ,COMMA and  the  keyword  is  rendering .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK rendering ,COMMA because  you  have  to  get  your  consumers ,COMMA as  business  people ,COMMA to  percieve  your  offerings  as  authentic .PERIOD because  there  is  a  basic  paradox ,COMMA no  one  can  have  an  inauthentic  experience ,COMMA but  no  business  can  supply  one .PERIOD because  all  businesses  are  man-made  objects .PERIOD all  business  is  involved  with  money .PERIOD all  business  is  a  matter  of  using  machinery ,COMMA and  all  those  things  make  something  inauthentic .PERIOD so ,COMMA how  do  you  render  authenticity ,COMMA is  the  question .PERIOD are  you  rendering  authenticity ?QUESTIONMARK when  you  think  about  that ,COMMA let  me  go  back  to  what  lionel  trilling ,COMMA in  his  seminal  book  on  authenticity ,COMMA sincerity  and  authenticity ,COMMA came  out  in  1960 ,COMMA points  to  as  the  seminal  point  at  which  authenticity  entered  the  lexicon ,COMMA if  you  will .PERIOD and  that  is ,COMMA to  no  surprise ,COMMA in  shakespeare ,COMMA and  in  his  play ,COMMA hamlet .PERIOD and  there  is  one  part  in  this  play ,COMMA hamlet ,COMMA where  the  most  fake  of  all  the  characters  in  hamlet ,COMMA polonius ,COMMA says  something  profoundly  real .PERIOD at  the  end  of  a  laundry  list  of  advice  he  's  giving  to  his  son ,COMMA laertes ,COMMA he  says  this ,COMMA and  this  above  all ,COMMA to  thine  own  self  be  true .PERIOD and  it  doth  follow ,COMMA as  night  the  day ,COMMA that  thou  canst  not  then  be  false  to  any  man .PERIOD and  those  three  verses  are  the  core  of  authenticity .PERIOD there  are  two  dimensions  to  authenticity ,COMMA one ,COMMA being  true  to  yourself ,COMMA which  is  very  self-directed .PERIOD two ,COMMA is  other-directed ,COMMA being  what  you  say  you  are  to  others .PERIOD and  i  do  n't  know  about  you ,COMMA but  whenever  i  encounter  two  dimensions ,COMMA i  immediately  go ,COMMA ahh ,COMMA two-by-two .PERIOD all  right ?QUESTIONMARK anybody  else  like  that ,COMMA no ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA if  you  think  about  that ,COMMA you  do ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA get  a  two-by-two .PERIOD where ,COMMA on  one  dimension  it  's  a  matter  of  being  true  to  yourself .PERIOD as  businesses ,COMMA are  the  economic  offerings  you  are  providing ,COMMA are  they  true  to  themselves ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  other  dimension  is ,COMMA are  they  what  they  say  they  are  to  others ?QUESTIONMARK if  not ,COMMA you  have ,COMMA is  not  true  to  itself ,COMMA and  is  not  what  it  says  it  is ,COMMA yielding  a  two-by-two  matrix .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA if  you  are  both  true  to  yourself ,COMMA and  are  what  you  say  you  are ,COMMA then  you  're  real  real .PERIOD the  opposite ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA is ,COMMA fake  fake .PERIOD all  right ,COMMA now ,COMMA there  is  value  for  fake .PERIOD there  will  always  be  companies  around  to  supply  the  fake ,COMMA because  there  will  always  be  desire  for  the  fake .PERIOD fact  is ,COMMA there  's  a  general  rule ,COMMA if  you  do  n't  like  it ,COMMA it  's  fake .PERIOD if  you  do  like  it ,COMMA it  's  faux .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  other  two  sides  of  the  coin  are ,COMMA being  a  real  fake ,COMMA is  what  it  says  it  is ,COMMA but  is  not  true  to  itself ,COMMA or  being  a  fake  real ,COMMA is  true  to  itself ,COMMA but  not  what  it  says  it  is .PERIOD you  can  think  about  those  two ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA both  of  these  better  than  being  fake  fake ,COMMA not  quite  as  good  as  being  real  real .PERIOD you  can  contrast  them  by  thinking  about  universal  city  walk  versus  disney  world ,COMMA or  disneyland .PERIOD universal  city  walk  is  a  real  fake ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA we  got  this  very  term  from  ada  louise  huxtable  's  book ,COMMA the  unreal  america  a  wonderful  book ,COMMA where  she  talks  about  universal  city  walk  as ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA she  decries  the  fake ,COMMA but  she  says ,COMMA at  least  that  's  a  real  fake ,COMMA right ,COMMA because  you  can  see  behind  the  facade ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK it  is  what  it  says  it  is ,COMMA it  's  universal  studio .PERIOD it  's  in  the  city  of  los  angeles .PERIOD you  're  going  to  walk  a  lot .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK you  do  n't  tend  to  walk  a  lot  in  los  angeles ,COMMA well ,COMMA here  's  a  place  where  you  are  going  to  walk  a  lot ,COMMA outside  in  this  city .PERIOD but  is  it  really  true  to  itself ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK is  it  really  in  the  city ?QUESTIONMARK is  it ,COMMA you  can  see  behind  all  of  it ,COMMA and  see  what  is  going  on  in  the  facades  of  it .PERIOD so  she  calls  it  a  real  fake .PERIOD disney  world ,COMMA on  the  other  hand ,COMMA is  a  fake  real ,COMMA or  a  fake  reality .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  not  what  it  says  it  is .PERIOD it  's  not  really  the  magic  kingdom .PERIOD but  it  is ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i  'm  sorry ,COMMA i  did  n't  mean  to ,COMMA sorry .PERIOD we  wo  n't  talk  about  santa  claus  then .PERIOD but  disney  world  is  wonderfully  true  to  itself .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK just  wonderfully  true  to  itself .PERIOD when  you  are  there  you  are  just  immersed  in  this  wonderful  environment .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  's  a  fake  real .PERIOD now  the  easiest  way  to  fall  down  in  this ,COMMA and  not  be  real  real ,COMMA right ,COMMA the  easiest  way  not  to  be  true  to  yourself  is  not  to  understand  your  heritage ,COMMA and  thereby  repudiate  that  heritage .PERIOD right ,COMMA the  key  of  being  true  to  yourself  is  knowing  who  you  are  as  a  business .PERIOD knowing  where  your  heritage  is ,COMMA what  you  have  done  in  the  past .PERIOD and  what  you  have  done  in  the  past  limits  what  you  can  do ,COMMA what  you  can  get  away  with ,COMMA essentially ,COMMA in  the  future .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  have  to  understand  that  past .PERIOD think  about  disney  again .PERIOD disney ,COMMA 10  or  15  years  ago ,COMMA right ,COMMA the  disney ,COMMA the  company  that  is  probably  best-known  for  family  values  out  there ,COMMA disney  bought  the  abc  network .PERIOD the  abc  network ,COMMA affectionately  known  in  the  trade  as  the  t&ampa  network ,COMMA right ,COMMA that  's  not  too  much  jargon ,COMMA is  it ?QUESTIONMARK right ,COMMA the  t&ampa  network .PERIOD then  it  bought  miramax ,COMMA known  for  its  nc-17  fare ,COMMA and  all  of  a  sudden ,COMMA families  everywhere  could  n't  really  trust  what  they  were  getting  from  disney .PERIOD it  was  no  longer  true  to  its  heritage .PERIOD no  longer  true  to  walt  disney .PERIOD that  's  one  of  the  reasons  why  they  're  having  such  trouble  today ,COMMA and  why  roy  disney  is  out  to  get  michael  eisner .PERIOD because  it  is  no  longer  true  to  itself .PERIOD so ,COMMA understand  what ,COMMA your  past  limits  what  you  can  do  in  the  future .PERIOD when  it  comes  to  being  what  you  say  you  are ,COMMA the  easiest  mistake  that  companies  make  is  that  they  advertise  things  that  they  are  not .PERIOD that  's  when  you  're  perceived  as  fake ,COMMA as  a  phony  company ,COMMA advertizing  things  that  you  're  not .PERIOD think  about  any  hotel ,COMMA any  airline ,COMMA any  hospital .PERIOD right ,COMMA if  you  could  check  into  the  ads ,COMMA you'd  have  a  great  experience .PERIOD but  unfortunately ,COMMA you  have  to  experience  the  actual  hotel ,COMMA airline  and  hospital ,COMMA and  then  you  have  that  disconnect .PERIOD then  you  have  that  perception  that  you  are  phony .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  number  one  thing  to  do  when  it  comes  to  being  what  you  say  you  are ,COMMA is  to  provide  places  for  people  to  experience  who  you  are .PERIOD for  people  to  experience  who  you  are .PERIOD right ,COMMA it  's  not  advertising  does  it .PERIOD that  's  why  you  have  companies  like  starbucks ,COMMA right ,COMMA that  does  n't  advertise  at  all .PERIOD they  said ,COMMA you  want  to  know  who  we  are ,COMMA you  have  to  come  experience  us .PERIOD and  think  about  the  economic  value  they  have  provided  by  that  experience .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK coffee ,COMMA at  its  core ,COMMA is  what ?QUESTIONMARK right ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  beans .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  coffee  beans .PERIOD you  know  how  much  coffee  is  worth ,COMMA when  treated  as  a  commodity  as  a  bean ?QUESTIONMARK two  or  three  cents  per  cup ,COMMA that  's  what  coffee  is  worth .PERIOD but  grind  it ,COMMA roast  it ,COMMA package  it ,COMMA put  it  on  a  grocery  store  shelf ,COMMA and  now  it  'll  cost  five ,COMMA 10 ,COMMA 15  cents ,COMMA when  you  treat  it  as  a  good .PERIOD take  that  same  good ,COMMA and  perform  the  service  of  actually  brewing  it  for  a  customer ,COMMA in  a  corner  diner ,COMMA in  a  bodega ,COMMA a  kiosk  somewhere ,COMMA you  get  50  cents ,COMMA maybe  a  buck  per  cup  of  coffee .PERIOD but  surround  the  brewing  of  that  coffee  with  the  ambiance  of  a  starbucks ,COMMA with  the  authentic  cedar  that  goes  inside  of  there ,COMMA and  now ,COMMA because  of  that  authentic  experience ,COMMA you  can  charge  two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five  dollars  for  a  cup  of  coffee .PERIOD so ,COMMA authenticity  is  becoming  the  new  consumer  sensibility .PERIOD let  me  summarize  it ,COMMA for  the  business  people  in  the  audience ,COMMA with  three  rules ,COMMA three  basic  rules .PERIOD one ,COMMA do  n't  say  you  're  authentic  unless  you  really  are  authentic .PERIOD two ,COMMA it  's  easier  to  be  authentic  if  you  do  n't  say  you  're  authentic .PERIOD and  three ,COMMA if  you  say  you  're  authentic ,COMMA you  better  be  authentic .PERIOD and  then  for  the  consumers ,COMMA for  everyone  else  in  the  audience ,COMMA let  me  simply  summarize  it  by  saying ,COMMA increasingly ,COMMA what  we ,COMMA what  will  make  us  happy ,COMMA is  spending  our  time  and  our  money  satisfying  the  desire  for  authenticity .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD when  i  was  seven  years  old  and  my  sister  was  just  five  years  old ,COMMA we  were  playing  on  top  of  a  bunk  bed .PERIOD i  was  two  years  older  than  my  sister  at  the  time ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA i  'm  two  years  older  than  her  now ,COMMA but  at  the  time  it  meant  she  had  to  do  everything  that  i  wanted  to  do ,COMMA and  i  wanted  to  play  war .PERIOD so  we  were  up  on  top  of  our  bunk  beds .PERIOD and  on  one  side  of  the  bunk  bed ,COMMA i  had  put  out  all  of  my  gi .PERIOD joe  soldiers  and  weaponry .PERIOD and  on  the  other  side  were  all  my  sister  's  my  little  ponies  ready  for  a  cavalry  charge .PERIOD there  are  differing  accounts  of  what  actually  happened  that  afternoon ,COMMA but  since  my  sister  is  not  here  with  us  today ,COMMA let  me  tell  you  the  true  story  -- .PERIOD --  which  is  my  sister  's  a  little  bit  on  the  clumsy  side .PERIOD somehow ,COMMA without  any  help  or  push  from  her  older  brother  at  all ,COMMA suddenly  amy  disappeared  off  of  the  top  of  the  bunk  bed  and  landed  with  this  crash  on  the  floor .PERIOD now  i  nervously  peered  over  the  side  of  the  bed  to  see  what  had  befallen  my  fallen  sister  and  saw  that  she  had  landed  painfully  on  her  hands  and  knees  on  all  fours  on  the  ground .PERIOD i  was  nervous  because  my  parents  had  charged  me  with  making  sure  that  my  sister  and  i  played  as  safely  and  as  quietly  as  possible .PERIOD and  seeing  as  how  i  had  accidentally  broken  amy  's  arm  just  one  week  before .PERIOD heroically  pushing  her  out  of  the  way  of  an  oncoming  imaginary  sniper  bullet ,COMMA for  which  i  have  yet  to  be  thanked ,COMMA i  was  trying  as  hard  as  i  could ,COMMA she  did  n't  even  see  it  coming ,COMMA i  was  trying  as  hard  as  i  could  to  be  on  my  best  behavior .PERIOD and  i  saw  my  sister  's  face ,COMMA this  wail  of  pain  and  suffering  and  surprise  threatening  to  erupt  from  her  mouth  and  threatening  to  wake  my  parents  from  the  long  winter  's  nap  for  which  they  had  settled .PERIOD so  i  did  the  only  thing  my  little  frantic  seven  year-old  brain  could  think  to  do  to  avert  this  tragedy .PERIOD and  if  you  have  children ,COMMA you've  seen  this  hundreds  of  times  before .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA amy ,COMMA amy ,COMMA wait .PERIOD do  n't  cry .PERIOD do  n't  cry .PERIOD did  you  see  how  you  landed ?QUESTIONMARK no  human  lands  on  all  fours  like  that .PERIOD amy ,COMMA i  think  this  means  you  're  a  unicorn  now  that  was  cheating ,COMMA because  there  was  nothing  in  the  world  my  sister  would  want  more  than  not  to  be  amy  the  hurt  five  year-old  little  sister ,COMMA but  amy  the  special  unicorn .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA this  was  an  option  that  was  open  to  her  brain  at  no  point  in  the  past .PERIOD and  you  could  see  how  my  poor ,COMMA manipulated  sister  faced  conflict ,COMMA as  her  little  brain  attempted  to  devote  resources  to  feeling  the  pain  and  suffering  and  surprise  she  just  experienced ,COMMA or  contemplating  her  new-found  identity  as  a  unicorn .PERIOD and  the  latter  won  out .PERIOD instead  of  crying ,COMMA instead  of  ceasing  our  play ,COMMA instead  of  waking  my  parents ,COMMA with  all  the  negative  consequences  that  would  have  ensued  for  me ,COMMA instead  a  smile  spread  across  her  face  and  she  scrambled  right  back  up  onto  the  bunk  bed  with  all  the  grace  of  a  baby  unicorn .PERIOD with  one  broken  leg .PERIOD what  we  stumbled  across  at  this  tender  age  of  just  five  and  seven ,COMMA we  had  no  idea  at  the  time ,COMMA was  something  that  was  going  be  at  the  vanguard  of  a  scientific  revolution  occurring  two  decades  later  in  the  way  that  we  look  at  the  human  brain .PERIOD what  we  had  stumbled  across  is  something  called  positive  psychology ,COMMA which  is  the  reason  that  i  'm  here  today  and  the  reason  that  i  wake  up  every  morning .PERIOD when  i  first  started  talking  about  this  research  outside  of  academia ,COMMA out  with  companies  and  schools ,COMMA the  very  first  thing  they  said  to  never  do  is  to  start  your  talk  with  a  graph .PERIOD the  very  first  thing  i  want  to  do  is  start  my  talk  with  a  graph .PERIOD this  graph  looks  boring ,COMMA but  this  graph  is  the  reason  i  get  excited  and  wake  up  every  morning .PERIOD and  this  graph  does  n't  even  mean  anything .PERIOD it  's  fake  data .PERIOD what  we  found  is ,COMMA if  i  got  this  data  back  studying  you  here  in  the  room ,COMMA i  would  be  thrilled ,COMMA because  there  's  very  clearly  a  trend  that  's  going  on  there ,COMMA and  that  means  that  i  can  get  published ,COMMA which  is  all  that  really  matters .PERIOD the  fact  that  there  's  one  weird  red  dot  that  's  up  above  the  curve ,COMMA there  's  one  weirdo  in  the  room ,COMMA i  know  who  you  are ,COMMA i  saw  you  earlier ,COMMA that  's  no  problem .PERIOD that  's  no  problem ,COMMA as  most  of  you  know ,COMMA because  i  can  just  delete  that  dot .PERIOD i  can  delete  that  dot  because  that  's  clearly  a  measurement  error .PERIOD and  we  know  that  's  a  measurement  error  because  it  's  messing  up  my  data .PERIOD so  one  of  the  very  first  things  we  teach  people  in  economics  and  statistics  and  business  and  psychology  courses  is  how ,COMMA in  a  statistically  valid  way ,COMMA do  we  eliminate  the  weirdos .PERIOD how  do  we  eliminate  the  outliers  so  we  can  find  the  line  of  best  fit ?QUESTIONMARK which  is  fantastic  if  i  'm  trying  to  find  out  how  many  advil  the  average  person  should  be  taking ,COMMA two .PERIOD but  if  i  'm  interested  in  potential ,COMMA if  i  'm  interested  in  your  potential ,COMMA or  for  happiness  or  productivity  or  energy  or  creativity ,COMMA what  we  're  doing  is  we  're  creating  the  cult  of  the  average  with  science .PERIOD if  i  asked  a  question  like ,COMMA how  fast  can  a  child  learn  how  to  read  in  a  classroom  scientists  change  the  answer  to  how  fast  does  the  average  child  learn  how  to  read  in  that  classroom  and  then  we  tailor  the  class  right  towards  the  average .PERIOD now  if  you  fall  below  the  average  on  this  curve ,COMMA then  psychologists  get  thrilled ,COMMA because  that  means  you  're  either  depressed  or  you  have  a  disorder ,COMMA or  hopefully  both .PERIOD we  're  hoping  for  both  because  our  business  model  is ,COMMA if  you  come  into  a  therapy  session  with  one  problem ,COMMA we  want  to  make  sure  you  leave  knowing  you  have  10 ,COMMA so  you  keep  coming  back  over  and  over  again .PERIOD we  'll  go  back  into  your  childhood  if  necessary ,COMMA but  eventually  what  we  want  to  do  is  make  you  normal  again .PERIOD but  normal  is  merely  average .PERIOD and  what  i  posit  and  what  positive  psychology  posits  is  that  if  we  study  what  is  merely  average ,COMMA we  will  remain  merely  average .PERIOD then  instead  of  deleting  those  positive  outliers ,COMMA what  i  intentionally  do  is  come  into  a  population  like  this  one  and  say ,COMMA why ?QUESTIONMARK why  is  it  that  some  of  you  are  so  high  above  the  curve  in  terms  of  your  intellectual  ability ,COMMA athletic  ability ,COMMA musical  ability ,COMMA creativity ,COMMA energy  levels ,COMMA your  resiliency  in  the  face  of  challenge ,COMMA your  sense  of  humor ?QUESTIONMARK whatever  it  is ,COMMA instead  of  deleting  you ,COMMA what  i  want  to  do  is  study  you .PERIOD because  maybe  we  can  glean  information ,COMMA not  just  how  to  move  people  up  to  the  average ,COMMA but  how  we  can  move  the  entire  average  up  in  our  companies  and  schools  worldwide .PERIOD the  reason  this  graph  is  important  to  me  is ,COMMA when  i  turn  on  the  news ,COMMA it  seems  like  the  majority  of  the  information  is  not  positive ,COMMA in  fact  it  's  negative .PERIOD most  of  it  's  about  murder ,COMMA corruption ,COMMA diseases ,COMMA natural  disasters .PERIOD and  very  quickly ,COMMA my  brain  starts  to  think  that  's  the  accurate  ratio  of  negative  to  positive  in  the  world .PERIOD what  that  's  doing  is  creating  something  called  the  medical  school  syndrome ,COMMA which ,COMMA if  you  know  people  who've  been  to  medical  school ,COMMA during  the  first  year  of  medical  training ,COMMA as  you  read  through  a  list  of  all  the  symptoms  and  diseases  that  could  happen ,COMMA suddenly  you  realize  you  have  all  of  them .PERIOD i  have  a  brother  in-law  named  bobo ,COMMA which  is  a  whole  other  story .PERIOD bobo  married  amy  the  unicorn .PERIOD bobo  called  me  on  the  phone  from  yale  medical  school ,COMMA and  bobo  said ,COMMA shawn ,COMMA i  have  leprosy  which ,COMMA even  at  yale ,COMMA is  extraordinarily  rare .PERIOD but  i  had  no  idea  how  to  console  poor  bobo  because  he  had  just  gotten  over  an  entire  week  of  menopause .PERIOD see  what  we  're  finding  is  it  's  not  necessarily  the  reality  that  shapes  us ,COMMA but  the  lens  through  which  your  brain  views  the  world  that  shapes  your  reality .PERIOD and  if  we  can  change  the  lens ,COMMA not  only  can  we  change  your  happiness ,COMMA we  can  change  every  single  educational  and  business  outcome  at  the  same  time .PERIOD when  i  applied  to  harvard ,COMMA i  applied  on  a  dare .PERIOD i  did  n't  expect  to  get  in ,COMMA and  my  family  had  no  money  for  college .PERIOD when  i  got  a  military  scholarship  two  weeks  later ,COMMA they  allowed  me  to  go .PERIOD suddenly ,COMMA something  that  was  n't  even  a  possibility  became  a  reality .PERIOD when  i  went  there ,COMMA i  assumed  everyone  else  would  see  it  as  a  privilege  as  well ,COMMA that  they'd  be  excited  to  be  there .PERIOD even  if  you  're  in  a  classroom  full  of  people  smarter  than  you ,COMMA you'd  be  happy  just  to  be  in  that  classroom ,COMMA which  is  what  i  felt .PERIOD but  what  i  found  there  is ,COMMA while  some  people  experience  that ,COMMA when  i  graduated  after  my  four  years  and  then  spent  the  next  eight  years  living  in  the  dorms  with  the  students ,COMMA harvard  asked  me  to .PERIOD i  was  n't  that  guy .PERIOD i  was  an  officer  of  harvard  to  counsel  students  through  the  difficult  four  years .PERIOD and  what  i  found  in  my  research  and  my  teaching  is  that  these  students ,COMMA no  matter  how  happy  they  were  with  their  original  success  of  getting  into  the  school ,COMMA two  weeks  later  their  brains  were  focused ,COMMA not  on  the  privilege  of  being  there ,COMMA nor  on  their  philosophy  or  their  physics .PERIOD their  brain  was  focused  on  the  competition ,COMMA the  workload ,COMMA the  hassles ,COMMA the  stresses ,COMMA the  complaints .PERIOD when  i  first  went  in  there ,COMMA i  walked  into  the  freshmen  dining  hall ,COMMA which  is  where  my  friends  from  waco ,COMMA texas ,COMMA which  is  where  i  grew  up ,COMMA i  know  some  of  you  have  heard  of  it .PERIOD when  they'd  come  to  visit  me ,COMMA they'd  look  around ,COMMA they'd  say ,COMMA this  freshman  dining  hall  looks  like  something  out  of  hogwart  's  from  the  movie  harry  potter ,COMMA which  it  does .PERIOD this  is  hogwart  's  from  the  movie  harry  potter  and  that  's  harvard .PERIOD and  when  they  see  this ,COMMA they  say ,COMMA shawn ,COMMA why  do  you  waste  your  time  studying  happiness  at  harvard ?QUESTIONMARK seriously ,COMMA what  does  a  harvard  student  possibly  have  to  be  unhappy  about  embedded  within  that  question  is  the  key  to  understanding  the  science  of  happiness .PERIOD because  what  that  question  assumes  is  that  our  external  world  is  predictive  of  our  happiness  levels ,COMMA when  in  reality ,COMMA if  i  know  everything  about  your  external  world ,COMMA i  can  only  predict  10  percent  of  your  long-term  happiness .PERIOD 90  percent  of  your  long-term  happiness  is  predicted  not  by  the  external  world ,COMMA but  by  the  way  your  brain  processes  the  world .PERIOD and  if  we  change  it ,COMMA if  we  change  our  formula  for  happiness  and  success ,COMMA what  we  can  do  is  change  the  way  that  we  can  then  affect  reality .PERIOD what  we  found  is  that  only  25  percent  of  job  successes  are  predicted  by  iq .PERIOD 75  percent  of  job  successes  are  predicted  by  your  optimism  levels ,COMMA your  social  support  and  your  ability  to  see  stress  as  a  challenge  instead  of  as  a  threat .PERIOD i  talked  to  a  boarding  school  up  in  new  england ,COMMA probably  the  most  prestigious  boarding  school ,COMMA and  they  said ,COMMA we  already  know  that .PERIOD so  every  year ,COMMA instead  of  just  teaching  our  students ,COMMA we  also  have  a  wellness  week .PERIOD and  we  're  so  excited .PERIOD monday  night  we  have  the  world  's  leading  expert  coming  in  to  speak  about  adolescent  depression .PERIOD tuesday  night  it  's  school  violence  and  bullying .PERIOD wednesday  night  is  eating  disorders .PERIOD thursday  night  is  elicit  drug  use .PERIOD and  friday  night  we  're  trying  to  decide  between  risky  sex  or  happiness .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA that  's  most  people  's  friday  nights  which  i  'm  glad  you  liked ,COMMA but  they  did  not  like  that  at  all .PERIOD silence  on  the  phone .PERIOD and  into  the  silence ,COMMA i  said ,COMMA i'd  be  happy  to  speak  at  your  school ,COMMA but  just  so  you  know ,COMMA that  's  not  a  wellness  week ,COMMA that  's  a  sickness  week .PERIOD what  you've  done  is  you've  outlined  all  the  negative  things  that  can  happen ,COMMA but  not  talked  about  the  positive  the  absence  of  disease  is  not  health .PERIOD here  's  how  we  get  to  health ,COMMA we  need  to  reverse  the  formula  for  happiness  and  success .PERIOD in  the  last  three  years ,COMMA i've  traveled  to  45  different  countries ,COMMA working  with  schools  and  companies  in  the  midst  of  an  economic  downturn .PERIOD and  what  i  found  is  that  most  companies  and  schools  follow  a  formula  for  success ,COMMA which  is  this ,COMMA if  i  work  harder ,COMMA i  'll  be  more  successful .PERIOD and  if  i  'm  more  successful ,COMMA then  i  'll  be  happier .PERIOD that  undergirds  most  of  our  parenting  styles ,COMMA our  managing  styles ,COMMA the  way  that  we  motivate  our  behavior .PERIOD and  the  problem  is  it  's  scientifically  broken  and  backwards  for  two  reasons .PERIOD first ,COMMA every  time  your  brain  has  a  success ,COMMA you  just  changed  the  goalpost  of  what  success  looked  like .PERIOD you  got  good  grades ,COMMA now  you  have  to  get  better  grades ,COMMA you  got  into  a  good  school  and  after  you  get  into  a  better  school ,COMMA you  got  a  good  job ,COMMA now  you  have  to  get  a  better  job ,COMMA you  hit  your  sales  target ,COMMA we  're  going  to  change  your  sales  target .PERIOD and  if  happiness  is  on  the  opposite  side  of  success ,COMMA your  brain  never  gets  there .PERIOD what  we've  done  is  we've  pushed  happiness  over  the  cognitive  horizon  as  a  society .PERIOD and  that  's  because  we  think  we  have  to  be  successful ,COMMA then  we  'll  be  happier .PERIOD but  the  real  problem  is  our  brains  work  in  the  opposite  order .PERIOD if  you  can  raise  somebody  's  level  of  positivity  in  the  present ,COMMA then  their  brain  experiences  what  we  now  call  a  happiness  advantage ,COMMA which  is  your  brain  at  positive  performs  significantly  better  than  it  does  at  negative ,COMMA neutral  or  stressed .PERIOD your  intelligence  rises ,COMMA your  creativity  rises ,COMMA your  energy  levels  rise .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA what  we've  found  is  that  every  single  business  outcome  improves .PERIOD your  brain  at  positive  is  31  percent  more  productive  than  your  brain  at  negative ,COMMA neutral  or  stressed .PERIOD you  're  37  percent  better  at  sales .PERIOD doctors  are  19  percent  faster ,COMMA more  accurate  at  coming  up  with  the  correct  diagnosis  when  positive  instead  of  negative ,COMMA neutral  or  stressed .PERIOD which  means  we  can  reverse  the  formula .PERIOD if  we  can  find  a  way  of  becoming  positive  in  the  present ,COMMA then  our  brains  work  even  more  successfully  as  we  're  able  to  work  harder ,COMMA faster  and  more  intelligently .PERIOD what  we  need  to  be  able  to  do  is  to  reverse  this  formula  so  we  can  start  to  see  what  our  brains  are  actually  capable  of .PERIOD because  dopamine ,COMMA which  floods  into  your  system  when  you  're  positive ,COMMA has  two  functions .PERIOD not  only  does  it  make  you  happier ,COMMA it  turns  on  all  of  the  learning  centers  in  your  brain  allowing  you  to  adapt  to  the  world  in  a  different  way .PERIOD we've  found  that  there  are  ways  that  you  can  train  your  brain  to  be  able  to  become  more  positive .PERIOD in  just  a  two-minute  span  of  time  done  for  21  days  in  a  row ,COMMA we  can  actually  rewire  your  brain ,COMMA allowing  your  brain  to  actually  work  more  optimistically  and  more  successfully .PERIOD we've  done  these  things  in  research  now  in  every  single  company  that  i've  worked  with ,COMMA getting  them  to  write  down  three  new  things  that  they  're  grateful  for  for  21  days  in  a  row ,COMMA three  new  things  each  day .PERIOD and  at  the  end  of  that ,COMMA their  brain  starts  to  retain  a  pattern  of  scanning  the  world ,COMMA not  for  the  negative ,COMMA but  for  the  positive  first .PERIOD journaling  about  one  positive  experience  you've  had  over  the  past  24  hours  allows  your  brain  to  relive  it .PERIOD exercise  teaches  your  brain  that  your  behavior  matters .PERIOD we  find  that  meditation  allows  your  brain  to  get  over  the  cultural  adhd  that  we've  been  creating  by  trying  to  do  multiple  tasks  at  once  and  allows  our  brains  to  focus  on  the  task  at  hand .PERIOD and  finally ,COMMA random  acts  of  kindness  are  conscious  acts  of  kindness .PERIOD we  get  people ,COMMA when  they  open  up  their  inbox ,COMMA to  write  one  positive  email  praising  or  thanking  somebody  in  their  social  support  network .PERIOD and  by  doing  these  activities  and  by  training  your  brain  just  like  we  train  our  bodies ,COMMA what  we've  found  is  we  can  reverse  the  formula  for  happiness  and  success ,COMMA and  in  doing  so ,COMMA not  only  create  ripples  of  positivity ,COMMA but  create  a  real  revolution .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD okay .PERIOD strolling  along  in  central  park  everyone  's  out  today  the  daisies  and  dogwoods  are  all  in  bloom  oh ,COMMA what  a  glorious  day  for  picnics  and  frisbees  and

have  my  halter-top  on  i  have  my  halter-top  on  everyone  's  out  in  merry  manhattan  in  january .PERIOD chris  anderson ,COMMA jill  sobule .PERIOD mountain  biking  in  israel  is  something  that  i  do  with  great  passion  and  commitment .PERIOD and  when  i  'm  on  my  bike ,COMMA i  feel  that  i  connect  with  the  profound  beauty  of  israel ,COMMA and  i  feel  that  i  'm  united  with  this  country  's  history  and  biblical  law .PERIOD and  also ,COMMA for  me ,COMMA biking  is  a  matter  of  empowerment .PERIOD when  i  reach  the  summit  of  a  steep  mountain  in  the  middle  of  nowhere ,COMMA i  feel  young ,COMMA invincible ,COMMA eternal .PERIOD it  's  as  if  i  'm  connecting  with  some  legacy  or  with  some  energy  far  greater  than  myself .PERIOD you  can  see  my  fellow  riders  at  the  end  of  the  picture ,COMMA looking  at  me  with  some  concern .PERIOD and  here  is  another  picture  of  them .PERIOD unfortunately ,COMMA i  cannot  show  their  faces ,COMMA neither  can  i  disclose  their  true  names ,COMMA and  that  's  because  my  fellow  riders  are  juvenile  inmates ,COMMA offenders  spending  time  in  a  correction  facility  about  20  minutes  ride  from  here  -- .PERIOD well ,COMMA like  everything  in  israel .PERIOD and  i've  been  riding  with  these  kids  once  a  week ,COMMA every  tuesday ,COMMA rain  or  shine ,COMMA for  the  last  four  years .PERIOD and  by  now ,COMMA they've  become  a  very  big  part  of  my  life .PERIOD this  story  began  four  years  ago .PERIOD the  correction  facility  where  they  are  locked  up  happens  to  be  right  in  the  middle  of  one  of  my  usual  trips ,COMMA and  it  's  surrounded  by  barbed  wires  and  electric  gates  and  armed  guards .PERIOD so  on  one  of  these  rides ,COMMA i  talked  my  way  into  the  compound  and  went  to  see  the  warden .PERIOD i  told  the  warden  that  i  wanted  to  start  a  mountain  biking  club  in  this  place  and  that  basically  i  wanted  to  take  the  kids  from  here  to  there .PERIOD and  i  told  him ,COMMA let  's  find  a  way  in  which  i  'll  be  able  to  take  out  10  kids  once  a  week  to  ride  with  in  the  summer  in  the  country .PERIOD and  the  warden  was  quite  amused ,COMMA and  he  told  me  he  thought  that  i  was  a  nut .PERIOD and  he  told  me ,COMMA this  place  is  a  correction  facility .PERIOD these  guys  are  serious  offenders .PERIOD they  are  supposed  to  be  locked  up .PERIOD they  are  n't  supposed  to  be  out  at  large .PERIOD and  yet ,COMMA we  began  to  talk  about  it ,COMMA and  one  thing  led  to  another .PERIOD and  i  cannot  see  myself  going  into  a  state  prison  in  new  jersey  and  making  such  a  proposition ,COMMA but  this  being  israel ,COMMA the  warden  somehow  made  it  happen .PERIOD and  so  two  months  later ,COMMA we  found  ourselves  at  large ,COMMA myself ,COMMA 10  juvenile  inmates  and  a  wonderful  fellow  named  russ ,COMMA who  became  a  very  good  friend  of  mine  and  my  partner  in  this  project .PERIOD and  in  the  next  few  weeks ,COMMA i  had  the  tremendous  pleasure  of  introducing  these  kids  to  the  world  of  total  freedom ,COMMA a  world  consisting  of  magnificent  vistas  like  these ,COMMA everything  you  see  here  is  obviously  in  israel ,COMMA as  well  as  close  encounters  with  all  sorts  of  small  creatures  coming  in  all  sorts  of  sizes ,COMMA colors ,COMMA shapes ,COMMA forms  and  so  on .PERIOD in  spite  of  all  this  splendor ,COMMA the  beginning  was  extremely  frustrating .PERIOD every  small  obstacle ,COMMA every  slight  uphill ,COMMA would  cause  these  fellows  to  stop  in  their  tracks  and  give  up .PERIOD so  we  had  a  lot  of  this  going  on .PERIOD i  found  out  that  they  had  a  very  hard  time  dealing  with  frustration  and  difficulties ,COMMA not  because  they  were  physically  unfit .PERIOD but  that  's  one  reason  why  they  ended  up  where  they  were .PERIOD and  i  became  increasingly  more  and  more  agitated ,COMMA because  i  was  there  not  only  to  be  with  them ,COMMA but  also  to  ride  and  create  a  team .PERIOD and  i  did  n't  know  what  to  do .PERIOD now ,COMMA let  me  give  you  an  example .PERIOD we  're  going  downhill  in  some  rocky  terrain ,COMMA and  the  front  tire  of  alex  gets  caught  in  one  of  these  crevasses  here .PERIOD so  he  crashes  down ,COMMA and  he  gets  slightly  injured ,COMMA but  this  does  not  prevent  him  from  jumping  up  and  then  starting  to  jump  up  and  down  on  his  bike  and  curse  violently .PERIOD then  he  throws  his  helmet  in  the  air .PERIOD his  backpack  goes  ballistic  in  some  other  direction .PERIOD and  then  he  runs  to  the  nearest  tree  and  starts  to  break  branches  and  throw  rocks  and  curse  like  i've  never  heard .PERIOD and  i  'm  just  standing  there ,COMMA watching  this  scene  with  a  complete  disbelief ,COMMA not  knowing  what  to  do .PERIOD i  'm  used  to  algorithms  and  data  structures  and  super  motivated  students ,COMMA and  nothing  in  my  background  prepared  me  to  deal  with  a  raging ,COMMA violent  adolescent  in  the  middle  of  nowhere .PERIOD and  you  have  to  realize  that  these  incidents  did  not  happen  in  convenient  locations .PERIOD they  happened  in  places  like  this ,COMMA in  the  judean  desert ,COMMA 20  kilometers  away  from  the  nearest  road .PERIOD and  what  you  do  n't  see  in  this  picture  is  that  somewhere  between  these  riders  there ,COMMA there  's  a  teenager  sitting  on  a  rock ,COMMA saying ,COMMA i  'm  not  moving  from  here .PERIOD forget  it .PERIOD i've  had  it .PERIOD well ,COMMA that  's  a  problem  because  one  way  or  another ,COMMA you  have  to  get  this  guy  moving  because  it  's  getting  dark  soon  and  dangerous .PERIOD it  took  me  several  such  incidents  to  figure  out  what  i  was  supposed  to  do .PERIOD at  the  beginning ,COMMA it  was  a  disaster .PERIOD i  tried  harsh  words  and  threats  and  they  took  me  nowhere .PERIOD that  's  what  they  had  all  their  lives .PERIOD and  at  some  point  i  found  out ,COMMA when  a  kid  like  this  gets  into  a  fit ,COMMA the  best  thing  that  you  can  possibly  do  is  stay  as  close  as  possible  to  this  kid ,COMMA which  is  difficult ,COMMA because  what  you  really  want  to  do  is  go  away .PERIOD but  that  's  what  he  had  all  his  life ,COMMA people  walking  away  from  him .PERIOD so  what  you  have  to  do  is  stay  close  and  try  to  reach  in  and  pet  his  shoulder  or  give  him  a  piece  of  chocolate .PERIOD so  i  would  say ,COMMA alex ,COMMA i  know  that  it  's  terribly  difficult .PERIOD why  do  n't  you  rest  for  a  few  minutes  and  then  we  'll  go  on .PERIOD go  away  you  maniac-psychopath .PERIOD why  would  you  bring  us  to  this  goddamn  place ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  would  say ,COMMA relax ,COMMA alex .PERIOD here  's  a  piece  of  chocolate .PERIOD and  alex  would  go ,COMMA arrrrggg  because  you  have  to  understand  that  on  these  rides  we  are  constantly  hungry ,COMMA and  after  the  rides  also .PERIOD and  who  is  this  guy ,COMMA alex ,COMMA to  begin  with ?QUESTIONMARK he  's  a  17-year-old .PERIOD when  he  was  eight ,COMMA someone  put  him  on  a  boat  in  odessa  on  his  own .PERIOD and  he  ended  up  in  south  tel  aviv  and  did  not  have  the  good  luck  to  be  picked  up  by  a  unclear .PERIOD and  roamed  the  streets  and  became  a  prominent  gang  member .PERIOD and  he  spent  the  last  10  years  of  his  life  in  two  places  only ,COMMA the  slums  and  the  state  prison ,COMMA where  he  spent  the  last  two  years  before  he  ended  up  sitting  on  this  rock  there .PERIOD and  so  this  kid  was  probably  abused ,COMMA abandoned ,COMMA ignored ,COMMA betrayed  by  almost  every  adult  along  the  way .PERIOD so ,COMMA for  such  a  kid ,COMMA when  an  adult  that  he  learns  to  respect  stays  close  to  him  and  does  n't  walk  away  from  him  in  any  situation ,COMMA irrespective  of  how  he  behaves ,COMMA it  's  a  tremendous  healing  experience .PERIOD it  's  an  act  of  unconditional  acceptance ,COMMA something  that  he  never  had .PERIOD i  want  to  say  a  few  words  about  vision .PERIOD when  i  started  this  program  four  years  ago ,COMMA i  had  this  original  plan  of  creating  a  team  of  winning  underdogs .PERIOD i  had  an  image  of  lance  armstrong  in  my  mind .PERIOD and  it  took  me  exactly  two  months  of  complete  frustration  to  realize  that  this  vision  was  misplaced ,COMMA and  that  there  was  another  vision  supremely  more  important  and  more  readily  available .PERIOD it  all  of  a  sudden  dawned  on  me ,COMMA in  this  project ,COMMA that  the  purpose  of  these  rides  should  actually  be  to  expose  the  kids  to  one  thing  only ,COMMA love .PERIOD love  to  the  country ,COMMA to  the  uphill  and  the  downhill ,COMMA to  all  the  incredible  creatures  that  surround  us ,COMMA the  animals ,COMMA the  plants ,COMMA the  insects  -- .PERIOD love  and  respect  to  other  fellow  members  in  your  team ,COMMA in  your  biking  team ,COMMA and  most  importantly ,COMMA love  and  respect  to  yourself ,COMMA which  is  something  that  they  badly  miss .PERIOD together  with  the  kids ,COMMA i  also  went  through  a  remarkable  transformation .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  come  from  a  cutthroat  world  of  science  and  high  technology .PERIOD i  used  to  think  that  reason  and  logic  and  relentless  drive  were  the  only  ways  to  make  things  happen .PERIOD and  before  i  worked  with  the  kids ,COMMA anything  that  i  did  with  them ,COMMA or  anything  that  i  did  with  myself ,COMMA was  supposed  to  be  perfect ,COMMA ideal ,COMMA optimal ,COMMA but  after  working  with  them  for  some  time ,COMMA i  discovered  the  great  virtues  of  empathy  and  flexibility  and  being  able  to  start  with  some  vision ,COMMA and  if  the  vision  does  n't  work ,COMMA well  nothing  happened .PERIOD all  you  have  to  do  is  play  with  it ,COMMA change  it  a  little  bit ,COMMA and  come  up  with  something  that  does  help ,COMMA that  does  work .PERIOD so  right  now ,COMMA i  feel  more  like  these  are  my  principles ,COMMA and  if  you  do  n't  like  them ,COMMA i  have  others .PERIOD and  one  of  these  principles  is  focus .PERIOD before  each  ride  we  sit  together  with  the  kids ,COMMA and  we  give  them  one  word  to  think  about  during  the  ride .PERIOD you  have  to  focus  their  attention  on  something  because  so  many  things  happen .PERIOD so  these  are  words  like  teamwork  or  endurance  or  even  complicated  concepts  like  resource  allocation  or  perspective ,COMMA a  word  that  they  do  n't  understand .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA perspective  is  one  of  these  critically  important  life-coping  strategies  that  mountain  biking  can  really  teach  you .PERIOD i  tell  kids  when  they  struggle  through  some  uphill  and  feel  like  they  cannot  take  it  anymore ,COMMA it  really  helps  to  ignore  the  immediate  obstacles  and  raise  your  head  and  look  around  and  see  how  the  vista  around  you  grows .PERIOD it  literally  propels  you  upwards .PERIOD that  's  what  perspective  is  all  about .PERIOD or  you  can  also  look  back  in  time  and  realize  that  you've  already  conquered  steeper  mountains  before .PERIOD and  that  's  how  they  develop  self-esteem .PERIOD now ,COMMA let  me  give  you  an  example  of  how  it  works .PERIOD you  stand  with  your  bike  at  the  beginning  of  february .PERIOD it  's  very  cold ,COMMA and  you  're  standing  in  one  of  these  rainy  days ,COMMA and  it  's  drizzling  and  cold  and  chilly ,COMMA and  you  're  standing  in ,COMMA let  's  say ,COMMA yokneam .PERIOD and  you  look  up  at  the  sky  through  a  hole  in  the  clouds  you  see  the  monastery  at  the  top  of  the  muhraka ,COMMA that  's  where  you  're  supposed  to  climb  now ,COMMA and  you  say ,COMMA there  's  no  way  that  i  could  possibly  get  there .PERIOD and  yet ,COMMA two  hours  later  you  find  yourself  standing  on  the  roof  of  this  monastery ,COMMA smeared  with  mud ,COMMA blood  and  sweat .PERIOD and  you  look  down  at  yokneam .PERIOD everything  is  so  small  and  tiny .PERIOD and  you  say ,COMMA hey ,COMMA alex .PERIOD look  at  this  parking  lot  where  we  started .PERIOD it  's  that  big .PERIOD i  cannot  believe  that  i  did  it .PERIOD and  that  's  the  point  when  you  start  loving  yourself .PERIOD and  so  we  talked  about  these  special  words  that  we  teach  them .PERIOD and  at  the  end  of  each  ride ,COMMA we  sit  together  and  share  moments  in  which  those  special  words  of  the  day  popped  up  and  made  a  difference .PERIOD and  these  discussions  can  be  extremely  inspiring .PERIOD in  one  of  them ,COMMA one  of  the  kids  once  said ,COMMA when  we  were  riding  on  this  ridge  overlooking  the  dead  sea ,COMMA and  he  's  talking  about  this  spot  here ,COMMA i  was  reminded  of  the  day  when  i  left  my  village  in  ethiopia  and  went  away  together  with  my  brother .PERIOD we  walked  120  kilometers  until  we  reached  sudan .PERIOD this  was  the  first  place  where  we  got  some  water  and  supplies .PERIOD and  he  goes  on  saying ,COMMA and  everyone  looks  at  him  like  a  hero ,COMMA probably  for  the  first  time  in  his  life .PERIOD and  he  says ,COMMA because  i  also  have  volunteers  riding  with  me ,COMMA adults ,COMMA who  are  sitting  there  listening  to  him  -- .PERIOD and  he  says ,COMMA and  this  was  just  the  beginning  of  our  ordeal  until  we  ended  up  in  israel .PERIOD and  only  now ,COMMA he  says ,COMMA i  'm  beginning  to  understand  where  i  am ,COMMA and  i  actually  like  it .PERIOD now  i  remember ,COMMA when  he  said  it ,COMMA i  felt  goosebumps  on  my  body ,COMMA because  he  said  it  overlooking  the  moab  mountains  here  in  the  background .PERIOD that  's  where  joshua  descended  and  crossed  the  jordan  and  led  the  people  of  israel  into  the  land  of  canaan  3,000  years  ago  in  this  final  leg  of  the  journey  from  africa .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA perspective  and  context  and  history  play  key  roles  in  the  way  i  plan  my  rides  with  the  kids .PERIOD we  visit  kibbutzim  that  were  established  by  holocaust  survivors .PERIOD we  explore  ruins  of  palestinian  villages ,COMMA and  we  discuss  how  they  became  ruins .PERIOD and  we  go  through  numerous  remnants  of  jewish  settlements ,COMMA nabatic  settlements ,COMMA canaanite  settlements ,COMMA three- ,COMMA four ,COMMA five-thousand  years  old .PERIOD and  through  this  tapestry ,COMMA which  is  the  history  of  this  country ,COMMA the  kids  acquire  what  is  probably  the  most  important  value  in  education ,COMMA and  that  is  the  understanding  that  life  is  complex ,COMMA and  there  's  no  black  and  white .PERIOD and  by  appreciating  complexity ,COMMA they  become  more  tolerant ,COMMA and  tolerance  leads  to  hope .PERIOD i  ride  with  these  kids  once  a  week ,COMMA every  tuesday .PERIOD here  's  a  picture  i  took  last  tuesday ,COMMA less  than  a  week  ago ,COMMA and  i  ride  with  them  tomorrow  also .PERIOD in  every  one  of  these  rides  i  always  end  up  standing  in  one  of  these  incredible  locations ,COMMA taking  in  this  incredible  landscape  around  me .PERIOD and  i  feel  blessed  and  fortunate  that  i  'm  alive ,COMMA and  that  i  sense  every  fiber  in  my  aching  body .PERIOD and  i  feel  blessed  and  fortunate  that  15  years  ago  i  had  the  courage  to  resign  my  tenured  position  at  nyu  and  return  to  my  home  country  where  i  can  do  these  incredible  rides  with  this  group  of  troubled  kids  coming  from  ethiopia  and  morocco  and  russia .PERIOD and  i  feel  blessed  and  fortunate  that  every  week ,COMMA every  tuesday ,COMMA and  actually  every  friday  also ,COMMA i  can  once  again  celebrate  in  the  marrow  of  my  bones  the  very  essence  of  living  in  israel  on  the  edge .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i'd  like  to  apologize ,COMMA first  of  all ,COMMA to  all  of  you  because  i  have  no  form  of  powerpoint  presentation .PERIOD so  what  i  'm  going  to  do  is ,COMMA every  now  and  again ,COMMA i  will  make  this  gesture ,COMMA and  in  a  moment  of  powerpoint  democracy ,COMMA you  can  imagine  what  you'd  like  to  see .PERIOD i  do  a  radio  show .PERIOD the  radio  show  is  called  the  infinite  monkey  cage .PERIOD it  's  about  science ,COMMA it  's  about  rationalism .PERIOD so  therefore ,COMMA we  get  a  lot  of  complaints  every  single  week ,COMMA complaints  including  one  we  get  very  often ,COMMA which  is  to  say  the  very  title ,COMMA infinite  monkey  cage ,COMMA celebrates  the  idea  of  vivisection .PERIOD we  have  made  it  quite  clear  to  these  people  that  an  infinite  monkey  cage  is  roomy .PERIOD we  also  had  someone  else  who  said ,COMMA the  infinite  monkey  cage  idea  is  ridiculous .PERIOD an

determine  much  of  the  answer  that  you  get .PERIOD and  so  if  you  ask  this  question ,COMMA where  would  you  look  to  see  the  future  of  education ?QUESTIONMARK the  answer  that  we've  traditionally  given  to  that  is  very  straightforward ,COMMA at  least  in  the  last  20  years: .PERIOD you  go  to  finland .PERIOD finland  is  the  best  place  in  the  world  to  see  school  systems .PERIOD the  finns  may  be  a  bit  boring  and  depressive  and  there  's  a  very  high  suicide  rate ,COMMA but  by  golly ,COMMA they  are  qualified .PERIOD and  they  have  absolutely  amazing  education  systems .PERIOD so  we  all  troop  off  to  finland ,COMMA and  we  wonder  at  the  social  democratic  miracle  of  finland  and  its  cultural  homogeneity  and  all  the  rest  of  it ,COMMA and  then  we  struggle  to  imagine  how  we  might  bring  lessons  back .PERIOD well ,COMMA so ,COMMA for  this  last  year ,COMMA with  the  help  of  cisco  who  sponsored  me ,COMMA for  some  balmy  reason ,COMMA to  do  this ,COMMA i've  been  looking  somewhere  else .PERIOD because  actually  radical  innovation  does  sometimes  come  from  the  very  best ,COMMA but  it  often  comes  from  places  where  you  have  huge  need ,COMMA unmet ,COMMA latent  demand ,COMMA and  not  enough  resources  for  traditional  solutions  to  work ,COMMA traditional ,COMMA high-cost  solutions ,COMMA which  depend  on  professionals ,COMMA which  is  what  schools  and  hospitals  are .PERIOD so  i  ended  up  in  places  like  this .PERIOD this  is  a  place  called  monkey  hill .PERIOD it  's  one  of  the  hundreds  of  favelas  in  rio .PERIOD most  of  the  population  growth  of  the  next  50  years  will  be  in  cities .PERIOD we  'll  grow  by  six  cities  of  12  million  people  a  year  for  the  next  30  years .PERIOD almost  all  of  that  growth  will  be  in  the  developed  world .PERIOD almost  all  of  that  growth  will  be  in  places  like  monkey  hill .PERIOD this  is  where  you  'll  find  the  fastest  growing  young  populations  of  the  world .PERIOD so  if  you  want  recipes  to  work ,COMMA for  virtually  anything ,COMMA health ,COMMA education ,COMMA government  politics  and  education ,COMMA you  have  to  go  to  these  places .PERIOD and  if  you  go  to  these  places ,COMMA you  meet  people  like  this .PERIOD this  is  a  guy  called  juanderson .PERIOD at  the  age  of  14 ,COMMA in  common  with  many  14-year-olds  in  the  brazilian  education  system ,COMMA he  dropped  out  of  school .PERIOD it  was  boring .PERIOD and  juanderson ,COMMA instead ,COMMA went  into  what  provided  kind  of  opportunity  and  hope  in  the  place  that  he  lived ,COMMA which  was  the  drugs  trade .PERIOD and  by  the  age  of  16 ,COMMA with  rapid  promotion ,COMMA he  was  running  the  drugs  trade  in  10  favelas .PERIOD he  was  turning  over  200,000  dollars  a  week .PERIOD he  employed  200  people .PERIOD he  was  going  to  be  dead  by  the  age  of  25 .PERIOD and  luckily ,COMMA he  met  this  guy ,COMMA who  is  rodrigo  baggio ,COMMA the  owner  of  the  first  laptop  to  ever  appear  in  brazil .PERIOD 1994 ,COMMA rodrigo  started  something  called  cdi ,COMMA which  took  computers  donated  by  corporations ,COMMA put  them  into  community  centers  in  favelas  and  created  places  like  this .PERIOD what  turned  juanderson  around  was  technology  for  learning  that  made  learning  fun  and  accessible .PERIOD or  you  can  go  to  places  like  this .PERIOD this  is  kibera ,COMMA which  is  the  largest  slum  in  east  africa .PERIOD millions  of  people  living  here ,COMMA stretched  over  many  kilometers .PERIOD and  there  i  met  these  two ,COMMA azra  on  the  left ,COMMA maureen  on  the  right .PERIOD they  just  finished  their  kenyan  certificate  of  secondary  education .PERIOD that  name  should  tell  you  that  the  kenyan  education  system  borrows  almost  everything  from  britain ,COMMA circa  1950 ,COMMA but  has  managed  to  make  it  even  worse .PERIOD so  there  are  schools  in  slums  like  this .PERIOD they  're  places  like  this .PERIOD that  's  where  maureen  went  to  school .PERIOD they  're  private  schools .PERIOD there  are  no  state  schools  in  slums .PERIOD and  the  education  they  got  was  pitiful .PERIOD it  was  in  places  like  this .PERIOD this  a  school  set  up  by  some  nuns  in  another  slum  called  nakuru .PERIOD half  the  children  in  this  classroom  have  no  parents  because  they've  died  through  aids .PERIOD the  other  half  have  one  parent  because  the  other  parent  has  died  through  aids .PERIOD so  the  challenges  of  education  in  this  kind  of  place  are  not  to  learn  the  kings  and  queens  of  kenya  or  britain .PERIOD they  are  to  stay  alive ,COMMA to  earn  a  living ,COMMA to  not  become  hiv  positive .PERIOD the  one  technology  that  spans  rich  and  poor  in  places  like  this  is  not  anything  to  do  with  industrial  technology .PERIOD it  's  not  to  do  with  electricity  or  water .PERIOD it  's  the  mobile  phone .PERIOD if  you  want  to  design  from  scratch  virtually  any  service  in  africa ,COMMA you  would  start  now  with  the  mobile  phone .PERIOD or  you  could  go  to  places  like  this .PERIOD this  is  a  place  called  the  madangiri  settlement  colony ,COMMA which  is  a  very  developed  slum  about  25  minutes  outside  new  delhi ,COMMA where  i  met  these  characters  who  showed  me  around  for  the  day .PERIOD the  remarkable  thing  about  these  girls ,COMMA and  the  sign  of  the  kind  of  social  revolution  sweeping  through  the  developing  world  is  that  these  girls  are  not  married .PERIOD ten  years  ago ,COMMA they  certainly  would  have  been  married .PERIOD now  they  're  not  married ,COMMA and  they  want  to  go  on  to  study  further ,COMMA to  have  a  career .PERIOD they've  been  brought  up  by  mothers  who  are  illiterate ,COMMA who  have  never  ever  done  homework .PERIOD all  across  the  developing  world  there  are  millions  of  parents ,COMMA tens ,COMMA hundreds  of  millions ,COMMA who  for  the  first  time  are  with  children  doing  homework  and  exams .PERIOD and  the  reason  they  carry  on  studying  is  not  because  they  went  to  a  school  like  this .PERIOD this  is  a  private  school .PERIOD this  is  a  fee-pay  school .PERIOD this  is  a  good  school .PERIOD this  is  the  best  you  can  get  in  hyderabad  in  indian  education .PERIOD the  reason  they  went  on  studying  was  this .PERIOD this  is  a  computer  installed  in  the  entrance  to  their  slum  by  a  revolutionary  social  entrepreneur  called  sugata  mitra  who  has  conducted  the  most  radical  experiments ,COMMA showing  that  children ,COMMA in  the  right  conditions ,COMMA can  learn  on  their  own  with  the  help  of  computers .PERIOD those  girls  have  never  touched  google .PERIOD they  know  nothing  about  wikipedia .PERIOD imagine  what  their  lives  would  be  like  if  you  could  get  that  to  them .PERIOD so  if  you  look ,COMMA as  i  did ,COMMA through  this  tour ,COMMA and  by  looking  at  about  a  hundred  case  studies  of  different  social  entrepreneurs  working  in  these  very  extreme  conditions ,COMMA look  at  the  recipes  that  they  come  up  with  for  learning ,COMMA they  look  nothing  like  school .PERIOD what  do  they  look  like ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA education  is  a  global  religion .PERIOD and  education ,COMMA plus  technology ,COMMA is  a  great  source  of  hope .PERIOD you  can  go  to  places  like  this .PERIOD this  is  a  school  three  hours  outside  of  sao  paulo .PERIOD most  of  the  children  there  have  parents  who  are  illiterate .PERIOD many  of  them  do  n't  have  electricity  at  home .PERIOD but  they  find  it  completely  obvious  to  use  computers ,COMMA websites ,COMMA make  videos ,COMMA so  on  and  so  forth .PERIOD when  you  go  to  places  like  this  what  you  see  is  that  education  in  these  settings  works  by  pull ,COMMA not  push .PERIOD most  of  our  education  system  is  push .PERIOD i  was  literally  pushed  to  school .PERIOD when  you  get  to  school ,COMMA things  are  pushed  at  you ,COMMA knowledge ,COMMA exams ,COMMA systems ,COMMA timetables .PERIOD if  you  want  to  attract  people  like  juanderson  who  could ,COMMA for  instance ,COMMA buy  guns ,COMMA wear  jewelry ,COMMA ride  motorbikes  and  get  girls  through  the  drugs  trade ,COMMA and  you  want  to  attract  him  into  education ,COMMA having  a  compulsory  curriculum  does  n't  really  make  sense .PERIOD that  is  n't  really  going  to  attract  him .PERIOD you  need  to  pull  him .PERIOD and  so  education  needs  to  work  by  pull ,COMMA not  push .PERIOD and  so  the  idea  of  a  curriculum  is  completely  irrelevant  in  a  setting  like  this .PERIOD you  need  to  start  education  from  things  that  make  a  difference  to  them  in  their  settings .PERIOD what  does  that ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  key  is  motivation ,COMMA and  there  are  two  aspects  to  it .PERIOD one  is  to  deliver  extrinsic  motivation .PERIOD that  education  has  a  payoff .PERIOD our  education  systems  all  work  on  the  principle  that  there  is  a  payoff ,COMMA but  you  have  to  wait  quite  a  long  time .PERIOD that  's  too  long  if  you  're  poor .PERIOD waiting  10  years  for  the  payoff  from  education  is  too  long  when  you  need  to  meet  daily  needs ,COMMA when  you've  got  siblings  to  look  after  or  a  business  to  help  with .PERIOD so  you  need  education  to  be  relevant  and  help  people  to  make  a  living  there  and  then ,COMMA often .PERIOD and  you  also  need  to  make  it  intrinsically  interesting .PERIOD so  time  and  again ,COMMA i  found  people  like  this .PERIOD this  is  an  amazing  guy ,COMMA sebastiao  rocha ,COMMA in  belo  horizonte ,COMMA in  the  third  largest  city  in  brazil .PERIOD he  's  invented  more  than  200  games  to  teach  virtually  any  subject  under  the  sun .PERIOD in  the  schools  and  communities  that  taio  works  in ,COMMA the  day  always  starts  in  a  circle  and  always  starts  from  a  question .PERIOD imagine  an  education  system  that  started  from  questions ,COMMA not  from  knowledge  to  be  imparted ,COMMA or  started  from  a  game ,COMMA not  from  a  lesson ,COMMA or  started  from  the  premise  that  you  have  to  engage  people  first  before  you  can  possibly  teach  them .PERIOD our  education  systems ,COMMA you  do  all  that  stuff  afterward ,COMMA if  you  're  lucky ,COMMA sport ,COMMA drama ,COMMA music .PERIOD these  things ,COMMA they  teach  through .PERIOD they  attract  people  to  learning  because  it  's  really  a  dance  project  or  a  circus  project  or ,COMMA the  best  example  of  all ,COMMA el  sistema  in  venezuela ,COMMA it  's  a  music  project .PERIOD and  so  you  attract  people  through  that  into  learning ,COMMA not  adding  that  on  after  all  the  learning  has  been  done  and  you've  eaten  your  cognitive  greens .PERIOD so  el  sistema  in  venezuela  uses  a  violin  as  a  technology  of  learning .PERIOD taio  rocha  uses  making  soap  as  a  technology  of  learning .PERIOD and  what  you  find  when  you  go  to  these  schemes  is  that  they  use  people  and  places  in  incredibly  creative  ways .PERIOD masses  of  peer  learning .PERIOD how  do  you  get  learning  to  people  when  there  are  no  teachers ,COMMA when  teachers  wo  n't  come ,COMMA when  you  cannot  afford  them ,COMMA and  even  if  you  do  get  teachers ,COMMA what  they  teach  is  n't  relevant  to  the  communities  that  they  serve ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA you  create  your  own  teachers .PERIOD you  create  peer-to-peer  learning ,COMMA or  you  create  para-teachers ,COMMA or  you  bring  in  specialist  skills .PERIOD but  you  find  ways  to  get  learning  that  's  relevant  to  people  through  technology ,COMMA people  and  places  that  are  different .PERIOD so  this  is  a  school  in  a  bus  on  a  building  site  in  pune ,COMMA the  fastest  growing  city  in  asia .PERIOD pune  has  5,000  building  sites .PERIOD it  has  30,000  children  on  those  building  sites .PERIOD that  's  one  city .PERIOD imagine  that  urban  explosion  that  's  going  to  take  place  across  the  developing  world  and  how  many  thousands  of  children  will  spend  their  school  years  on  building  sites .PERIOD well ,COMMA this  is  a  very  simple  scheme  to  get  the  learning  to  them  through  a  bus .PERIOD and  they  all  treat  learning ,COMMA not  as  some  sort  of  academic ,COMMA analytical  activity ,COMMA but  as  that  's  something  that  's  productive ,COMMA something  you  make ,COMMA something  that  you  can  do ,COMMA perhaps  earn  a  living  from .PERIOD so  i  met  this  character ,COMMA steven .PERIOD he'd  spent  three  years  in  nairobi  living  on  the  streets  because  his  parents  had  died  of  aids .PERIOD and  he  was  finally  brought  back  into  school ,COMMA not  by  the  offer  of  gcses ,COMMA but  by  the  offer  of  learning  how  to  become  a  carpenter ,COMMA a  practical  making  skill .PERIOD so  the  trendiest  schools  in  the  world ,COMMA high  tech  high  and  others ,COMMA they  espouse  a  philosophy  of  learning  as  productive  activity .PERIOD here ,COMMA there  is  n't  really  an  option .PERIOD learning  has  to  be  productive  in  order  for  it  to  make  sense .PERIOD and  finally ,COMMA they  have  a  different  model  of  scale .PERIOD and  it  's  a  chinese  restaurant  model  of  how  to  scale .PERIOD and  i  learned  it  from  this  guy ,COMMA who  is  an  amazing  character .PERIOD he  's  probably  the  most  remarkable  social  entrepreneur  in  education  in  the  world .PERIOD his  name  is  madhav  chavan ,COMMA and  he  created  something  called  pratham .PERIOD and  pratham  runs  preschool  play  groups  for ,COMMA now ,COMMA 21  million  children  in  india .PERIOD it  's  the  largest  ngo  in  education  in  the  world .PERIOD and  it  also  supports  working-class  kids  going  into  indian  schools .PERIOD he  's  a  complete  revolutionary .PERIOD he  's  actually  a  trade  union  organizer  by  background .PERIOD and  that  's  how  he  learned  the  skills  to  build  his  organization .PERIOD when  they  got  to  a  certain  stage ,COMMA pratham  got  big  enough  to  attract  some  pro  bono  support  from  mckinsey .PERIOD mckinsey  came  along  and  looked  at  his  model  and  said ,COMMA you  know  what  you  should  do  with  this ,COMMA madhav ?QUESTIONMARK you  should  turn  it  into  mcdonald  's .PERIOD and  what  you  do  when  you  go  to  any  new  site  is  you  kind  of  roll  out  a  franchise .PERIOD and  it  's  the  same  wherever  you  go .PERIOD it  's  reliable  and  people  know  exactly  where  they  are .PERIOD and  there  will  be  no  mistakes .PERIOD and  madhav  said ,COMMA why  do  we  have  to  do  it  that  way ?QUESTIONMARK why  cannot  we  do  it  more  like  the  chinese  restaurants  there  are  chinese  restaurants  everywhere ,COMMA but  there  is  no  chinese  restaurant  chain .PERIOD yet ,COMMA everyone  knows  what  is  a  chinese  restaurant .PERIOD they  know  what  to  expect ,COMMA even  though  it  'll  be  subtly  different  and  the  colors  will  be  different  and  the  name  will  be  different .PERIOD you  know  a  chinese  restaurant  when  you  see  it .PERIOD these  people  work  with  the  chinese  restaurant  model  -- .PERIOD same  principles ,COMMA different  applications  and  different  settings  -- .PERIOD not  the  mcdonald  's  model .PERIOD the  mcdonald  's  model  scales .PERIOD the  chinese  restaurant  model  spreads .PERIOD so  mass  education  started  with  social  entrepreneurship  in  the  19th  century .PERIOD and  that  's  desperately  what  we  need  again  on  a  global  scale .PERIOD and  what  can  we  learn  from  all  of  that ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA we  can  learn  a  lot  because  our  education  systems  are  failing  desperately  in  many  ways .PERIOD they  fail  to  reach  the  people  they  most  need  to  serve .PERIOD they  often  hit  their  target  but  miss  the  point .PERIOD improvement  is  increasingly  difficult  to  organize .PERIOD our  faith  in  these  systems ,COMMA incredibly  fraught .PERIOD and  this  is  just  a  very  simple  way  of  understanding  what  kind  of  innovation ,COMMA what  kind  of  different  design  we  need .PERIOD there  are  two  basic  types  of  innovation .PERIOD there  's  sustaining  innovation ,COMMA which  will  sustain  an  existing  institution  or  an  organization ,COMMA and  disruptive  innovation  that  will  break  it  apart ,COMMA create  some  different  way  of  doing  it .PERIOD there  are  formal  settings ,COMMA schools ,COMMA colleges ,COMMA hospitals ,COMMA in  which  innovation  can  take  place ,COMMA and  informal  settings ,COMMA communities ,COMMA families ,COMMA social  networks .PERIOD almost  all  our  effort  goes  in  this  box ,COMMA sustaining  innovation  in  formal  settings ,COMMA getting  a  better  version  of  the  essentially  bismarckian  school  system  that  developed  in  the  19th  century .PERIOD and  as  i  said ,COMMA the  trouble  with  this  is  that ,COMMA in  the  developing  world  there  just  are  n't  teachers  to  make  this  model  work .PERIOD you'd  need  millions  and  millions  of  teachers  in  china ,COMMA india ,COMMA nigeria  and  the  rest  of  developing  world  to  meet  need .PERIOD and  in  our  system ,COMMA we  know  that  simply  doing  more  of  this  wo  n't  eat  into  deep  educational  inequalities ,COMMA especially  in  inner  cities  and  former  industrial  areas .PERIOD so  that  's  why  we  need  three  more  kinds  of  innovation .PERIOD we  need  more  reinvention .PERIOD and  all  around  the  world  now  you  see  more  and  more  schools  reinventing  themselves .PERIOD they  're  recognizably  schools ,COMMA but  they  look  different .PERIOD there  are  big  picture  schools  in  the  us .PERIOD and  australia .PERIOD there  are  kunskapsskolan  schools  in  sweden .PERIOD of  14  of  them ,COMMA only  two  of  them  are  in  schools .PERIOD most  of  them  are  in  other  buildings  not  designed  as  schools .PERIOD there  is  an  amazing  school  in  northen  queensland  called  jaringan .PERIOD and  they  all  have  the  same  kind  of  features ,COMMA highly  collaborative ,COMMA very  personalized ,COMMA often  pervasive  technology .PERIOD learning  that  starts  from  questions  and  problems  and  projects ,COMMA not  from  knowledge  and  curriculum .PERIOD so  we  certainly  need  more  of  that .PERIOD but  because  so  many  of  the  issues  in  education  are  n't  just  in  school ,COMMA they  're  in  family  and  community ,COMMA what  you  also  need ,COMMA definitely ,COMMA is  more  on  the  right  hand  side .PERIOD you  need  efforts  to  supplement  schools .PERIOD the  most  famous  of  these  is  reggio  emilia  in  italy ,COMMA the  family-based  learning  system  to  support  and  encourage  people  in  schools .PERIOD the  most  exciting  is  the  harlem  children  's  zone ,COMMA which  over  10  years ,COMMA led  by  geoffrey  canada ,COMMA has ,COMMA through  a  mixture  of  schooling  and  family  and  community  projects ,COMMA attempted  to  transform  not  just  education  in  schools ,COMMA but  the  entire  culture  and  aspiration  of  about  10,000  families  in  harlem .PERIOD we  need  more  of  that  completely  new  and  radical  thinking .PERIOD you  can  go  to  places  an  hour  away ,COMMA less ,COMMA from  this  room ,COMMA just  down  the  road ,COMMA which  need  that ,COMMA which  need  radicalism  of  a  kind  that  we  have  n't  imagined .PERIOD and  finally ,COMMA you  need  transformational  innovation  that  could  imagine  getting  learning  to  people  in  completely  new  and  different  ways .PERIOD so  we  are  on  the  verge ,COMMA 2015 ,COMMA of  an  amazing  achievement ,COMMA the  schoolification  of  the  world .PERIOD every  child  up  to  the  age  of  15  who  wants  a  place  in  school  will  be  able  to  have  one  in  2015 .PERIOD it  's  an  amazing  thing .PERIOD but  it  is ,COMMA unlike  cars ,COMMA which  have  developed  so  rapidly  and  orderly ,COMMA actually  the  school  system  is  recognizably  an  inheritance  from  the  19th  century ,COMMA from  a  bismarkian  model  of  german  schooling  that  got  taken  up  by  english  reformers ,COMMA and  often  by  religious  missionaries ,COMMA taken  up  in  the  united  states  as  a  force  of  social  cohesion ,COMMA and  then  in  japan  and  south  korea  as  they  developed .PERIOD it  's  recognizably  19th  century  in  its  roots .PERIOD and  of  course  it  's  a  huge  achievement .PERIOD and  of  course  it  will  bring  great  things .PERIOD it  will  bring  skills  and  learning  and  reading .PERIOD but  it  will  also  lay  waste  to  imagination .PERIOD it  will  lay  waste  to  appetite .PERIOD it  will  lay  waste  to  social  confidence .PERIOD it  will  stratify  society  as  much  as  it  liberates  it .PERIOD and  we  are  bequeathing  to  the  developing  world  school  systems  that  they  will  now  spend  a  century  trying  to  reform .PERIOD that  is  why  we  need  really  radical  thinking ,COMMA and  why  radical  thinking  is  now  more  possible  and  more  needed  than  ever  in  how  we  learn .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD does  anybody  know  when  the  stethoscope  was  invented ?QUESTIONMARK any  guesses ?QUESTIONMARK 1816 .PERIOD and  what  i  can  say  is ,COMMA in  2016 ,COMMA doctors  are  n't  going  to  be  walking  around  with  stethoscopes .PERIOD there  's  a  whole  lot  better  technology  coming .PERIOD and  that  's  part  of  the  change  in  medicine .PERIOD what  has  changed  our  society  has  been  wireless  devices .PERIOD but  the  future  are  digital  medical  wireless  devices ,COMMA ok ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA let  me  give  you  some  examples  of  this  to  kind  of  make  this  much  more  concrete .PERIOD this  is  the  first  one .PERIOD this  is  an  electrocardiogram .PERIOD and ,COMMA as  a  cardiologist ,COMMA to  think  that  you  could  see  in  real  time  a  patient ,COMMA an  individual ,COMMA anywhere  in  the  world  on  your  smartphone ,COMMA watching  your  rhythm ,COMMA that  's  incredible .PERIOD and  it  's  with  us  today .PERIOD but  that  's  just  the  beginning .PERIOD you  check  your  email  while  you  're  sitting  here .PERIOD in  the  future  you  're  going  to  be  checking  all  your  vital  signs .PERIOD all  your  vital  signs ,COMMA your  heart  rhythm .PERIOD your  blood  pressure ,COMMA your  oxygen ,COMMA your  temperature ,COMMA etc .PERIOD this  is  already  available  today .PERIOD this  is  airstrip  technologies .PERIOD by  taking  the  aggregate  of  these  signals  in  the  hospital ,COMMA in  the  intensive  care  unit ,COMMA and  putting  it  on  a  smartphone  for  physicians .PERIOD if  you  're  an  expectant  parent ,COMMA what  about  the  ability  to  monitor ,COMMA continuously ,COMMA fetal  heart  rate ,COMMA or  intrauterine  contractions ,COMMA and  not  having  to  worry  so  much  that  things  are  fine  as  the  pregnancy ,COMMA and  moving  over  into  the  time  of  delivery ?QUESTIONMARK and  then  as  we  go  further ,COMMA today  we  have  continuous  glucose  sensors .PERIOD right  now ,COMMA they  are  under  the  skin .PERIOD but  in  the  future ,COMMA they  wo  n't  have  to  be  implanted .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA the  desired  range ,COMMA trying  to  keep  glucose  between  75  and  less  than  200 ,COMMA checking  it  every  five  minutes  in  a  continuous  glucose  sensor  -- .PERIOD you  'll  see  how  that  can  impact  diabetes .PERIOD and  what  about  sleep ?QUESTIONMARK we  're  going  to  zoom  in  on  that  a  little  bit .PERIOD we  're  supposed  to  spend  a  third  of  our  life  in  sleep .PERIOD what  if ,COMMA on  your  phone ,COMMA which  will  be  available  in  the  next  few  weeks ,COMMA you  had  every  minute  of  your  sleep  displayed ?QUESTIONMARK and  this  is ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA as  you  can  see ,COMMA the  awake  is  the  orange .PERIOD the  rem  sleep ,COMMA rapid  eye  movement ,COMMA dream  state ,COMMA is  in  light  green .PERIOD and  light  is  gray ,COMMA light  sleep .PERIOD and  deep  sleep ,COMMA the  best  restorative  sleep ,COMMA is  that  dark  green .PERIOD how  about  counting  every  calorie ?QUESTIONMARK and  this  is  ability ,COMMA in  real  time ,COMMA to  actually  take  measurements  of  caloric  intake  as  well  as  expenditure ,COMMA through  a  band-aid .PERIOD now ,COMMA what  i've  talked  about  are  physiologic  metrics .PERIOD but  what  i  want  to  get  to ,COMMA the  next  frontier ,COMMA very  quickly ,COMMA and  why  the  stethoscope  is  on  its  way  out .PERIOD is  because  we  can  transcend  listening  to  the  valve  sounds ,COMMA and  the  breath  sounds ,COMMA because  now .PERIOD introduced  by  ge .PERIOD is  a  handheld  ultra-sound .PERIOD why  is  this  important ?QUESTIONMARK because  this  is  so  much  more  sensitive .PERIOD here  is  an  example  of  an  abdominal  ultrasound .PERIOD and  also  a  cardiac  echo ,COMMA which  can  be  sent  wireless .PERIOD and  then  there  's  an  example  of  fetal  monitoring  on  your  smartphone .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  're  not  just  talking  about  physiologic  metrics ,COMMA the  key  measurements  of  vital  signs ,COMMA and  all  those  things  in  physiology ,COMMA but  also  all  the  imaging  that  one  could  look  at  in  your  smartphone .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  is  an  example  of  another  obsolete  technology ,COMMA soon  to  be  buried ,COMMA the  holter  monitor .PERIOD twenty-four  hour  recording ,COMMA lots  of  wires .PERIOD this  is  now  a  little  tiny  patch .PERIOD you  can  put  it  on  for  two  weeks  and  send  it  in  the  mail .PERIOD now ,COMMA how  does  this  work ?QUESTIONMARK well .PERIOD there  is  these  smart  band-aids  or  these  sensors  that  one  would  put  on ,COMMA on  a  shoe  or  on  the  wrist .PERIOD and  this  sends  a  signal .PERIOD and  it  creates  a  body  area  network  to  a  gateway .PERIOD gateway  could  be  a  smartphone  or  it  could  be  a  dedicated  gateway ,COMMA as  today  many  of  these  things  are  dedicated  gateways ,COMMA because  they  are  not  so  well  integrated .PERIOD that  signal  goes  to  the  web ,COMMA the  cloud ,COMMA and  then  it  can  be  processed  and  sent  anywhere ,COMMA to  a  caregiver ,COMMA to  a  physician ,COMMA back  to  the  patient ,COMMA etc .PERIOD so ,COMMA that  's  basically  very  simplistic  technology  of  how  this  works .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  have  this  device  on .PERIOD i  did  n't  want  to  take  my  shirt  off  to  show  you ,COMMA but  i  can  tell  you  it  's  on .PERIOD this  is  a  device  that  not  only  measures  cardiac  rhythm ,COMMA as  you  saw  already ,COMMA but  it  also  goes  well  beyond  that .PERIOD this  is  me  now .PERIOD and  you  can  see  the  ecg .PERIOD below  that  's  the  actual  heart  rate  and  the  trend .PERIOD to  the  right  of  that  is  a  bioconductant .PERIOD that  's  the  fluid  status .PERIOD fluid  status ,COMMA that  's  really  important  if  you  're  monitoring  somebody  with  heart  failure .PERIOD and  below  that  's  temperature ,COMMA and  respiration ,COMMA and  oxygen .PERIOD and  then  the  position  activity .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  is  really  striking ,COMMA because  this  device  measures  seven  things  that  are  very  much  vital  signs  for  monitoring  someone  with  heart  failure .PERIOD ok ?QUESTIONMARK and  why  is  this  important ?QUESTIONMARK well .PERIOD this  is  the  most  expensive  bed .PERIOD what  if  we  could  reduce  the  need  for  hospital  beds ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA we  can .PERIOD first  of  all ,COMMA heart  failure  is  the  number  one  reason  for  hospital  admissions  and  readmissions  in  this  country .PERIOD the  cost  of  heart  failure  is  37  billion  dollars  a  year ,COMMA which  is  80  percent  related  to  hospitalization .PERIOD and  in  the  course  of  30  days  after  a  hospital  stay  for  a  medicare  greater  than  65  years  or  older ,COMMA is ,COMMA 27  percent  are  readmitted  in  30  days .PERIOD and  by  six  months ,COMMA over  56  percent  are  readmitted .PERIOD so ,COMMA can  we  improve  that ?QUESTIONMARK well  the  idea  is  we  take  this  device  that  i  'm  wearing ,COMMA and  we  put  it  on  600  patients  with  heart  failure ,COMMA randomly  assigned ,COMMA versus  600  patients  who  do  n't  have  active  monitoring .PERIOD and  see  whether  we  can  reduce  heart  failure  readmissions .PERIOD and  that  's  exciting .PERIOD and  we  'll  start  that  trial ,COMMA and  you  'll  hear  more  about  how  we  're  going  to  do  that .PERIOD but  that  's  a  type  of  wireless  device  trial  that  could  change  medicine  in  the  years  ahead .PERIOD why  now ?QUESTIONMARK why  has  this  all  of  a  sudden  become  a  reality ,COMMA an  exciting  direction  in  the  future  of  medicine ?QUESTIONMARK what  we  have  is ,COMMA in  a  way ,COMMA a  perfect  positive  storm .PERIOD this  sets  up  consumer-driven  healthcare .PERIOD that  's  where  this  is  all  starting .PERIOD let  me  just  give  you  specifics  about  why  this  is  a  big  movement  if  you  're  not  aware  of  it: .PERIOD 12  million  americans  have  gotten  a  nike  shoe ,COMMA which  is  a  body-area  network  that  connects  the  shoe ,COMMA the  sole  of  the  shoe  to  the  iphone ,COMMA or  an  ipod .PERIOD and  this  wired  magazine  cover  article  really  captured  a  lot  of  this .PERIOD it  talked  a  lot  about  the  nike  shoe  and  how  quickly  that  's  been  adopted  to  monitor  exercise  physiology  and  energy  expenditure .PERIOD here  are  some  things ,COMMA the  principles  that  are  guiding  principles  to  keep  in  mind ,COMMA a  data-driven  health  revolution  promises  to  make  us  all  better ,COMMA faster ,COMMA and  stronger .PERIOD living  by  numbers .PERIOD this  was  from  july ,COMMA this  cover  article ,COMMA the  personal  metrics  movement  goes  way  beyond  diet  and  exercise .PERIOD it  's  about  tracking  every  facet  of  life ,COMMA from  sleep  to  mood  to  pain ,COMMA 24/7/365 .PERIOD well ,COMMA i  tried  this  device .PERIOD a  lot  of  you  have  gotten  that  phillips  direct  life .PERIOD but  i  got  the  fitbit .PERIOD that  looks  like  this .PERIOD it  's  like  a  wireless  accelerometer ,COMMA pedometer .PERIOD and  i  want  to  just  give  you  the  results  of  that  testing ,COMMA because  i  wanted  to  understand  about  the  consumer  movement .PERIOD i  hope  the ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA the  phillips  direct  life  works  better  -- .PERIOD i  hope  so .PERIOD but  this  monitors  food ,COMMA it  monitors  activity  and  tracks  weight .PERIOD however  you  have  to  put  in  most  of  this  stuff .PERIOD the  only  thing  it  really  tracks  by  itself  is  activity .PERIOD and  even  then ,COMMA it  's  not  complete .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  exercise  and  it  picks  up  the  exercise .PERIOD you  put  in  your  height  and  weight ,COMMA it  calculates  bmi .PERIOD and  of  course  it  tells  you  how  many  calories  you  're  expending  from  the  exercise ,COMMA and  how  many  you  took  in ,COMMA if  you  go  in  and  enter  all  the  foods .PERIOD but  it  really  wants  you  to  enter  all  your  activity .PERIOD and  so  i  went  to  this ,COMMA and  of  course  i  was  gratified  that  it  picked  up  the  42  minutes  of  exercise ,COMMA elliptical  exercise  i  did .PERIOD but  then  it  wants  more  information .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  says ,COMMA you  want  to  log  sexual  activity .PERIOD how  long  did  you  do  it  for ?QUESTIONMARK and  it  says ,COMMA how  hard  was  it ?QUESTIONMARK furthermore  it  says ,COMMA start  time .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  does  n't  appear ,COMMA this  just  does  n't  work .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA this  just  does  n't  work .PERIOD so ,COMMA now  i  want  to  move  to  sleep .PERIOD who  would  ever  have  thought  you  could  have  your  own  eeg  at  your  home ,COMMA tagged  to  a  very  nice  alarm  clock ,COMMA by  the  way ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  the  headband  that  goes  with  this  alarm  clock .PERIOD it  monitors  your  brainwaves  continuously ,COMMA when  you  're  sleeping .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  did  this  thing  for  seven  days  getting  ready  for  tedmed .PERIOD this  is  an  important  part  of  our  life ,COMMA one-third  you  're  supposed  to  be  sleeping .PERIOD of  course  how  many  here  have  any  problems  with  sleeping ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  usually  90  percent .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  tell  me  you  sleep  better  than  expected .PERIOD okay ,COMMA well  this  was  a  week  of  my  life  in  sleeping .PERIOD and  you  get  a  zq .PERIOD score .PERIOD instead  of  an  iq .PERIOD score .PERIOD you  get  a  zq .PERIOD score  when  you  wake  up .PERIOD you  say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA ok  and  a  zq .PERIOD score  is  adjusted  to  age .PERIOD and  you  want  to  get  as  high  as  you  possibly  can .PERIOD so  this  is  the  moment-by-moment ,COMMA or  minute-by-minute  sleep .PERIOD and  you  see  that  zq .PERIOD there  was  80-odd .PERIOD and  the  wake  time  is  in  orange .PERIOD and  this  can  be  a  problem ,COMMA as  i  learned .PERIOD because  it  not  only  helps  you  with  quantifying  your  sleep ,COMMA but  also  tells  others  you  're  awake .PERIOD so ,COMMA when  my  wife  came  in  and  she  could  tell  you  're  awake .PERIOD eric ,COMMA i  want  to  talk .PERIOD i  want  to  talk .PERIOD and  i  'm  trying  to  play  possum .PERIOD this  thing  is  very ,COMMA very  impressive .PERIOD ok .PERIOD so ,COMMA that  's  the  first  night .PERIOD and  this  one  is  now  67 .PERIOD and  that  's  not  a  good  score .PERIOD and  this  tells  you ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA how  much  you  had  in  rem  sleep ,COMMA in  deep  sleep ,COMMA and  all  this  sort  of  thing .PERIOD this  was  really  fascinating  because  this  gave  that  quantitation  about  all  the  different  phases  of  sleep .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  also  then  tells  you  how  you  do  compared  to  your  age  group .PERIOD it  's  like  a  managed  competition  of  sleep .PERIOD and  really  interesting  stuff .PERIOD look  at  this  thing  and  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  did  n't  think  i  was  a  very  good  sleeper ,COMMA but  actually  i  did  better  than  average  in  50  to  60  year  olds  ok ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  key  thing  was ,COMMA what  i  did  n't  know ,COMMA was  that  i  was  a  really  good  dreamer .PERIOD ok .PERIOD now  let  's  move  from  sleep  to  diseases .PERIOD eighty  percent  of  americans  have  chronic  disease .PERIOD or  80  percent  of  age  greater  than  65  have  two  or  more  chronic  disease .PERIOD 140  million  americans  have  one  or  more  chronic  disease .PERIOD and  80  percent  of  our  15 ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA trillion  expenditures  are  related  to  chronic  disease .PERIOD now ,COMMA diabetes  is  one  of  the  big  ones .PERIOD almost  24  million  people  have  diabetes .PERIOD and  here  is  the  latest  map .PERIOD it  was  published  just  a  little  more  than  a  week  ago  in  the  new  york  times .PERIOD and  it  is  n't  looking  good .PERIOD that  is ,COMMA for  men ,COMMA 29  percent  in  the  country  over  60  have  type  ii  diabetes .PERIOD and  women ,COMMA although  it  's  less ,COMMA it  's  terribly  high .PERIOD but  of  course  we  have  a  way  to  measure  that  now  on  a  continuous  basis ,COMMA with  a  sensor  that  detects  blood  glucose .PERIOD and  it  's  important  because  we  could  detect  hyperglycemia  that  otherwise  would  n't  be  known ,COMMA and  also  hypoglycemia .PERIOD and  you  can  see  the  red  dots ,COMMA in  this  particular  patient  's  case ,COMMA were  finger  sticks ,COMMA which  would  have  missed  both  ends .PERIOD but  by  continuous  monitoring ,COMMA it  captures  all  that  vital  information .PERIOD the  future  of  this  though ,COMMA is  being  able  to  move  this  to  a  band-aid  type  phenomenon .PERIOD and  that  's  not  so  far  away .PERIOD so ,COMMA let  me  just  give  you ,COMMA very  quickly ,COMMA 10  top  targets  for  wireless  medicine .PERIOD all  these  things  are  possible  -- .PERIOD some  of  them  are  very  close ,COMMA or  already ,COMMA as  you  heard ,COMMA are  available  today ,COMMA in  some  way  or  form .PERIOD alzheimer  's  disease ,COMMA there  's  five  million  people  affected ,COMMA and  you  can  check  vital  signs ,COMMA activity ,COMMA balance .PERIOD asthma ,COMMA large  number ,COMMA we  could  detect  things  like  pollen  count ,COMMA air  quality ,COMMA respiratory  rate .PERIOD breast  cancer .PERIOD i  'll  show  you  an  example  of  that  real  quickly .PERIOD chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease .PERIOD depression ,COMMA there  's  a  great  approach  to  that  in  mood  disorders .PERIOD diabetes  i've  just  mentioned .PERIOD heart  failure  we  already  talked  about .PERIOD hypertension ,COMMA 74  million  people  could  have  continuous  blood-pressure  monitoring  to  come  up  with  much  better  management  and  prevention .PERIOD and  obesity  we  already  talked  about ,COMMA the  ways  to  get  to  that .PERIOD and  sleep  disorders .PERIOD this  is  effective  around  the  world .PERIOD the  access  to  smartphones  and  cell  phones  today  is  extraordinary .PERIOD and  this  article  from  the  economist  summed  it  up  beautifully  about  the  opportunities  in  health  across  the  developing  world: .PERIOD mobile  phones  made  a  bigger  difference  to  the  lives  of  more  people ,COMMA more  quickly ,COMMA than  any  previous  technology .PERIOD and  that  's  before  we  got  going  on  the  m-health  world .PERIOD aging ,COMMA the  problem  is  enormous .PERIOD 300,000  broken  hips  per  year .PERIOD but  the  solutions  are  extraordinary .PERIOD and  they  include  so  many  different  things .PERIOD one  of  the  ones  i  just  wanted  to  mention ,COMMA the  ishoe  is  another  example  of  a  sensor  that  improves  proprioception  among  the  elderly  to  prevent  falling .PERIOD one  of  many  different  techniques  using  wireless  sensors .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  can  change  medicine  across  the  continuum  of  care ,COMMA across  the  ages  from  premies  or  unborn  children  to  seniors .PERIOD the  pharmaceutical  arena  changes .PERIOD the  full  spectrum  of  disease ,COMMA i  hope  i've  given  you  a  sense  of  that ,COMMA across  the  globe .PERIOD there  are  two  things  that  can  really  accelerate  this  whole  process .PERIOD one  of  them ,COMMA we  're  very  fortunate ,COMMA is  to  develop  a  dedicated  institute  and  that  's  work  that  started  with  the  work  that  scripps  with  qualcomm .PERIOD and  then  the  great  fortune  of  meeting  up  with  gary  and  mary  west ,COMMA to  get  behind  this  wireless  health  institute .PERIOD san  diego  is  an  extraordinary  place  for  this .PERIOD there  's  over  650  wireless  companies .PERIOD 100  of  which  or  more  are  working  in  wireless  health .PERIOD it  's  the  number  one  source  of  commerce ,COMMA and  interestingly  it  dovetails  beautifully  with  over  500  life  science  companies .PERIOD the  wireless  institute ,COMMA the  west  wireless  health  institute ,COMMA is  really  the  outgrowth  of  two  extraordinary  people  who  are  here  this  evening ,COMMA gary  and  mary  west .PERIOD and  i'd  like  to  give  it  up  for  them  for  getting  behind  this .PERIOD their  fantastic  philanthropic  investment  made  this  possible .PERIOD and  this  is  really  a  nonprofit  education  center  which  is  just  about  to  open .PERIOD it  looks  like  this .PERIOD this  whole  building  dedicated .PERIOD and  what  it  's  trying  to  do  is  accelerate  this  era ,COMMA to  take  unmet  medical  needs ,COMMA to  work  and  innovate  -- .PERIOD and  we  just  appointed  the  chief  engineer ,COMMA mehran  mehregany .PERIOD it  was  announced  on  monday  -- .PERIOD then  to  move  up  with  development ,COMMA clinical  trial  validation  and  then  changing  medical  practice ,COMMA the  most  challenging  thing  of  all ,COMMA requiring  attention  to  reimbursement ,COMMA healthcare  policy ,COMMA healthcare  economics .PERIOD the  other  big  thing ,COMMA besides  having  this  fantastic  institute  to  catalyze  this  process  is  guidance .PERIOD and  that  's  of  course  relying  on  the  fact  that  medicine  goes  digital .PERIOD if  we  understand  biology  from  genomics  and  omics  and  wireless  through  physiologic  phenotyping ,COMMA that  's  big .PERIOD because  what  it  does  is  allow  a  convergence  like  we've  never  had  before .PERIOD over  80  major  diseases  have  been  cracked  at  the  genomic  level ,COMMA but  this  is  quite  extraordinary ,COMMA more  has  been  learned  about  the  underpinnings  of  disease  in  the  last  two  and  a  half  years  than  in  the  history  of  man .PERIOD and  when  you  put  that  together  with ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA now  an  app  for  the  iphone  with  your  genotype  to  guide  drug  therapy .PERIOD but ,COMMA the  future ,COMMA we  can  now  tell  who  's  going  to  get  type  ii  diabetes  from  all  the  common  variants ,COMMA and  that  's  going  to  get  filled  in  more  with  low-frequency  variants  in  the  future .PERIOD we  can  tell  who  's  going  to  get  breast  cancer  from  the  various  genes .PERIOD we  can  also  know  who  's  likely  to  get  atrial  fibrillation .PERIOD and  finally ,COMMA another  example ,COMMA sudden  cardiac  death .PERIOD each  of  these  has  a  sensor .PERIOD we  can  give  glucose  a  sensor  for  diabetes  to  prevent  it .PERIOD we  can  prevent ,COMMA or  have  the  earliest  detection  possible ,COMMA for  breast  cancer  with  an  ultrasound  device  given  to  the  patient .PERIOD an  ipatch ,COMMA irhythm ,COMMA for  atrial  fibrillation .PERIOD and  vital-signs  monitoring  to  prevent  sudden  cardiac  death .PERIOD we  lose  700,000  people  a  year  in  the  us .PERIOD from  sudden  cardiac  death .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  hope  i've  convinced  you  of  this .PERIOD of  the  impact  on  hospital  clinic  resources  is  profound .PERIOD and  then  the  impact  on  diseases  is  equally  impressive  across  all  these  different  diseases  and  more .PERIOD it  's  really  taking  individualized  medicine  to  a  new  height  and  it  's  hyper-innovative .PERIOD and  i  think  it  represents  the  black  swan  of  medicine .PERIOD thanks  for  your  attention .PERIOD i  got  a  visit  almost  exactly  a  year  ago ,COMMA a  little  over  a  year  ago ,COMMA from  a  very  senior  person  at  the  department  of  defense .PERIOD came  to  see  me  and  said ,COMMA 1,600  of  the  kids  that  we've  sent  out  have  come  back  missing  at  least  one  full  arm .PERIOD whole  arm .PERIOD shoulder  disarticulation .PERIOD and  we  're  doing  the  same  thing  we  did  for ,COMMA more  or  less ,COMMA that  we've  done  since  the  civil  war ,COMMA a  stick  and  a  hook .PERIOD and  they  deserve  more  than  that .PERIOD and  literally ,COMMA this  guy  sat  in  my  office  in  new  hampshire  and  said ,COMMA i  want  you  to  give  me  something  that  we  can  put  on  these  kids  that  'll  pick  up  a  raisin  or  a  grape  off  a  table ,COMMA they  'll  be  able  to  put  it  in  their  mouth  without  destroying  either  one ,COMMA and  they  'll  be  able  to  know  the  difference  without  looking  at  it .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA had  efferent ,COMMA afferent ,COMMA and  haptic  response .PERIOD he  finishes  explaining  that ,COMMA and  i  'm  waiting  for  the  big  300  pound  paper  proposal .PERIOD and  he  said ,COMMA that  's  what  i  want  from  you .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA look ,COMMA you  're  nuts .PERIOD that  technology  's  just  not  available  right  now .PERIOD and  it  cannot  be  done .PERIOD not  in  an  envelope  of  a  human  arm ,COMMA with  21  degrees  of  freedom ,COMMA from  your  shoulder  to  your  fingertips .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA about  two  dozen  of  these  1,600  kids  have  come  back  bilateral .PERIOD you  think  it  's  bad  to  lose  one  arm ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  an  inconvenience  compared  to  having  both  of  them  gone .PERIOD i  got  a  day  job ,COMMA and  my  nights  and  weekends  are  already  filled  up  with  things  like ,COMMA let  's  supply  water  to  the  world ,COMMA and  power  to  the  world ,COMMA and  educate  all  the  kids ,COMMA which ,COMMA chris ,COMMA i  will  not  talk  about .PERIOD i  do  n't  need  another  mission .PERIOD i  keep  thinking  about  these  kids  with  no  arms .PERIOD he  says  to  me ,COMMA we've  done  some  work  around  the  country .PERIOD we've  got  some  pretty  amazing  neurology  and  other  people .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA i  'll  take  a  field  trip ,COMMA i  'll  go  see  what  you  got .PERIOD over  the  next  month  i  visited  lots  of  places ,COMMA some  out  here ,COMMA around  the  country ,COMMA found  the  best  of  the  best .PERIOD i  went  down  to  washington .PERIOD i  saw  these  guys ,COMMA and  said ,COMMA i  did  what  you  asked  me .PERIOD i  looked  at  what  's  out  there .PERIOD i  still  think  you  're  nuts .PERIOD but  not  as  nuts  as  i  thought .PERIOD i  put  a  team  together ,COMMA a  little  over  13  months  ago ,COMMA got  up  to  20  some-odd  people .PERIOD we  said ,COMMA we  're  going  to  build  a  device  that  does  what  he  wants .PERIOD we  have  14  out  of  the  21  degrees  of  freedom .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  the  ones  in  the  last  two  fingers .PERIOD we  put  this  thing  together .PERIOD a  couple  of  weeks  ago  we  took  it  down  to  walter  reed ,COMMA which  is  unfortunately  more  in  the  news  these  days .PERIOD we  showed  it  to  a  bunch  of  guys .PERIOD one  guy  who  described  himself  as  being  lucky ,COMMA because  he  lost  his  left  arm ,COMMA and  he  's  a  righty .PERIOD he  sat  at  a  table  with  seven  or  eight  of  these  other  guys .PERIOD said  he  was  lucky ,COMMA because  he  had  his  good  arm ,COMMA and  then  he  pushed  himself  back  from  the  table .PERIOD he  had  no  legs .PERIOD these  kids  have  attitudes  that  you  just  cannot  believe .PERIOD so  i  'm  going  to  show  you  now ,COMMA without  the  skin  on  it ,COMMA a  30-second  piece ,COMMA and  then  i  'm  done .PERIOD but  understand  what  you  're  looking  at  we  made  small  enough  to  fit  on  a  50th  percentile  female ,COMMA so  that  we  could  put  it  in  any  of  these  people .PERIOD it  's  going  to  go  inside  something  that  we  use  in  cat  scans  and  mris  of  whatever  is  their  good  arm ,COMMA to  make  silicon  rubber ,COMMA then  coat  it ,COMMA and  paint  it  in  3d ,COMMA exact  mirror  image  of  their  other  limb .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  wo  n't  see  all  the  really  cool  stuff  that  's  in  this  series  elastic  set  of  14  actuators ,COMMA each  one  which  has  its  own  capability  to  sense  temperature  and  pressure .PERIOD it  also  has  a  pneumatic  cuff  that  holds  it  on ,COMMA so  the  more  they  put  themselves  under  load ,COMMA the  more  it  attaches .PERIOD they  take  the  load  off ,COMMA and  it  becomes ,COMMA again ,COMMA compliant .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  guy  doing  a  couple  of  simple  things  with  this  that  we  demonstrated  in  washington .PERIOD can  we  look  at  this  thing ?QUESTIONMARK watch  the  fingers  grab .PERIOD the  thumb  comes  up .PERIOD wrist .PERIOD this  weighs  69  pounds .PERIOD going  to  scratch  his  nose .PERIOD it  's  got  14  active  degrees  of  freedom .PERIOD now  he  's  going  to  pick  up  a  pen  with  his  opposed  thumb  and  index  finger .PERIOD now  he  's  going  to  put  that  down ,COMMA pick  up  a  piece  of  paper ,COMMA rotate  all  the  degrees  of  freedom  in  his  hand  and  wrist ,COMMA and  read  it .PERIOD i  want  to  talk  about  46  billion  years  of  history  in  18  minutes .PERIOD that  's  300  million  years  per  minute .PERIOD let  's  start  with  the  first  photograph  nasa  obtained  of  planet  mars .PERIOD this  is  fly-by ,COMMA mariner  iv .PERIOD it  was  taken  in  1965 .PERIOD when  this  picture  appeared ,COMMA that  well-known  scientific  journal ,COMMA the  new  york  times ,COMMA wrote  in  its  editorial ,COMMA mars  is  uninteresting .PERIOD it  's  a  dead  world .PERIOD nasa  should  not  spend  any  time  or  effort  studying  mars  anymore .PERIOD fortunately ,COMMA our  leaders  in  washington  at  nasa  headquarters  knew  better .PERIOD and  we  began  a  very  extensive  study  of  the  red  planet .PERIOD one  of  the  key  questions  in  all  of  science ,COMMA is  there  life  outside  of  earth ?QUESTIONMARK i  believe  that  mars  is  the  most  likely  target  for  life  outside  the  earth .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  show  you  in  a  few  minutes  some  amazing  measurements  that  suggest  there  may  be  life  on  mars .PERIOD but  let  me  start  with  a  viking  photograph .PERIOD this  is  a  composite  taken  by  viking  in  1976 .PERIOD viking  was  developed  and  managed  at  the  nasa  langley  research  center .PERIOD we  sent  two  orbiters  and  two  landers  in  the  summer  of  1976 .PERIOD we  had  four  spacecraft ,COMMA two  around  mars ,COMMA two  on  the  surface ,COMMA an  amazing  accomplishment .PERIOD this  is  the  first  photograph  taken  from  the  surface  of  any  planet .PERIOD this  is  a  viking  lander  photograph  of  the  surface  of  mars .PERIOD and  yes ,COMMA the  red  planet  is  red .PERIOD mars  is  half  the  size  of  the  earth ,COMMA but

that  they  are  prepared  to  die  for .PERIOD well  now ,COMMA how  are  we  going  to  tell  the  good  memes  from  the  bad  memes ?QUESTIONMARK that  is  not  the  job  of  the  science  of  memetics .PERIOD memetics  is  morally  neutral .PERIOD and  so  it  should  be .PERIOD this  is  not  the  place  for  hate  and  anger .PERIOD if  you've  had  a  friend  who  's  died  of  aids ,COMMA then  you  hate  hiv .PERIOD but  the  way  to  deal  with  that  is  to  do  science ,COMMA and  understand  how  it  spreads  and  why  in  a  morally  neutral  perspective .PERIOD get  the  facts .PERIOD work  out  the  implications .PERIOD there  's  plenty  of  room  for  moral  passion  once  we've  got  the  facts  and  can  figure  out  the  best  thing  to  do .PERIOD and ,COMMA as  with  germs ,COMMA the  trick  is  not  to  try  to  annihilate  them .PERIOD you  will  never  annihilate  the  germs .PERIOD what  you  can  do ,COMMA however ,COMMA is  foster  public  health  measures  and  the  like  that  will  encourage  the  evolution  of  avirulence .PERIOD that  will  encourage  the  spread  of  relatively  benign  mutations  of  the  most  toxic  varieties .PERIOD that  's  all  the  time  i  have ,COMMA so  thank  you  very  much  for  your  attention .PERIOD i  'm  rich  baraniuk .PERIOD and  what  i'd  like  to  talk  a  little  bit  about  today  are  some  ideas  that  i  think  have  just  tremendous  resonance  with  all  the  things  that  have  been  talked  about  the  last  two  days .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA so  many  different  points  of  resonance  that  it  's  going  to  be  difficult  to  bring  them  all  up ,COMMA but  i  'll  try  to  do  my  best .PERIOD does  anybody  remember  these ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA so  these  are  lp  records  and  they've  been  replaced ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK they've  been  swept  away  over  the  last  two  decades  by  these  types  of  world-flattening  digitization  technologies ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  think  it  was  best  witnessed  when  thomas  was  playing  the  music  as  we  came  in  the  room  today .PERIOD what  's  happened  in  the  music  world  is  there  's  a  culture  or  an  ecosystem  that  's  been  created  that ,COMMA if  you  take  some  words  from  apple ,COMMA the  catchphrase  that  we  create ,COMMA rip ,COMMA mix  and  burn .PERIOD what  i  mean  by  that  is  that  anyone  in  the  world  is  free  and  allowed  to  create  new  music  and  musical  ideas .PERIOD anyone  in  the  world  is  allowed  to  rip  or  copy  musical  ideas ,COMMA use  them  in  innovative  ways .PERIOD anyone  is  allowed  to  mix  them  in  different  types  of  ways ,COMMA draw  connections  between  musical  ideas  and  people  can  burn  them  or  create  final  products  and  continue  the  circle .PERIOD and  what  that  's  done  is  it  's  created ,COMMA like  i  said ,COMMA a  vibrant  community  that  's  very  inclusive  with  people  continually  working  to  connect  musical  ideas ,COMMA innovate  them  and  keep  things  constantly  up  to  date .PERIOD today  's  hit  single  is  not  last  year  's  hit  single .PERIOD but ,COMMA i  'm  not  here  to  talk  about  music  today .PERIOD i  'm  here  to  talk  about  books .PERIOD in  particular ,COMMA textbooks  and  the  kind  of  educational  materials  that  we  use  every  day  in  school .PERIOD has  anyone  here  ever  been  to  school ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA does  anybody  realize  there  's  a  crisis  in  our  schools ,COMMA around  the  world ?QUESTIONMARK ok ,COMMA i  'm  not  going  to  spend  too  much  time  on  that ,COMMA but  what  i  want  to  talk  about  is  some  of  the  disconnects  that  appear  when  an  author  publishes  a  book  that  in  fact ,COMMA the  publishing  process ,COMMA just  because  of  the  fact  that  it  's  complicated ,COMMA it  's  heavy ,COMMA books  are  expensive ,COMMA creates  a  sort  of  a  wall  between  authors  of  books  and  the  ultimate  users  of  books ,COMMA be  they  teachers ,COMMA students  or  just  general  readers .PERIOD and  this  is  even  more  true  if  you  happen  to  speak  a  language  other  than  one  of  the  world  's  major  languages ,COMMA and  especially  english .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  call  these  people  below  the  barrier  shut-outs ,COMMA because  they  're  really  shut  out  of  the  process  of  being  able  to  share  their  knowledge  with  the  world .PERIOD and  so  what  i  want  to  talk  about  today  is  trying  to  take  these  ideas  that  we've  seen  in  the  musical  culture  and  try  to  bring  these  towards  reinventing  the  way  we  think  about  writing  books ,COMMA using  them  and  teaching  from  them .PERIOD so ,COMMA that  's  what  i'd  like  to  talk  about  and  really ,COMMA how  do  we  get  from  where  we  are  now  to  where  we  need  to  go ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA the  first  thing  i'd  like  you  to  do  is  a  little  thought  experiment .PERIOD so ,COMMA imagine  taking  all  the  world  's  books .PERIOD ok ,COMMA everybody  imagine  books  and  imagine  just  tearing  out  the  pages .PERIOD so ,COMMA liberating  these  pages  and  imagine  digitizing  them  and  then  storing  them  in  a  vast ,COMMA interconnected ,COMMA global  repository .PERIOD think  of  it  as  a  massive  itunes  for  book  type  content .PERIOD and  then  take  that  material  and  imagine  making  it  all  open ,COMMA so  that  people  can  modify  it ,COMMA play  with  it ,COMMA improve  it .PERIOD imagine  making  it  free ,COMMA so  that  anyone  in  the  world  can  have  access  to  all  of  this  knowledge ,COMMA and  imagine  using  information  technology  so  that  you  can  update  this  content ,COMMA improve  it ,COMMA play  with  it ,COMMA on  a  timescale  that  's  more  on  the  order  of  seconds  instead  of  years .PERIOD instead  of  editions  coming  out  every  two  years ,COMMA of  a  book ,COMMA imagine  it  coming  out  every  25  seconds .PERIOD so ,COMMA imagine  we  could  do  that  and  imagine  we  could  put  people  into  this .PERIOD so  that  we  could  truly  build  an  ecosystem  with  not  just  authors ,COMMA but  all  the  people  who  could  be  or  want  to  be  authors  in  all  the  different  languages  of  the  world ,COMMA and  i  think  if  you  could  do  this ,COMMA it  would  be  called ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  'm  just  going  to  refer  to  it  as  a  knowledge  ecosystem .PERIOD so ,COMMA really ,COMMA this  is  the  dream  and  in  a  sense  what  you  can  think  of  it  is  we  are  trying  to  enable  anyone  in  the  world ,COMMA i  mean  anyone  in  the  world ,COMMA to  be  their  own  educational  dj .PERIOD creating  educational  materials ,COMMA sharing  them  with  the  world ,COMMA constantly  innovating  on  them .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  is  the  dream .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA this  dream  is  actually  being  realized .PERIOD over  the  last  six-and-a-half  years ,COMMA we've  been  working  really  hard  at  rice  university  on  a  project  called  connexions ,COMMA and  so  what  i'd  like  to  do  for  the  rest  of  the  talk  is  just  tell  you  a  little  bit  about  what  people  are  doing  with  connexions ,COMMA which  you  can  kind  of  think  of  as  the  counterpoint  to  nicholas  negroponte  's  talk  yesterday ,COMMA where  they  're  working  on  the  hardware  of  bringing  education  to  the  world .PERIOD we  're  working  on  the  open-source  tools  and  the  content .PERIOD so ,COMMA that  's  sort  of  to  put  it  in  perspective  here .PERIOD so ,COMMA create .PERIOD so  what  are  some  of  the  people  that  are  using  these  kind  of  tools ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  first  thing  is  there  's  a  community  of  engineering  professors ,COMMA from  cambridge  to  kyoto ,COMMA who  are  developing  engineering  content  in  electrical  engineering  to  develop  what  you  can  think  of  as  a  massive ,COMMA super  textbook  that  covers  the  entire  area  of  electrical  engineering ,COMMA and  not  only  that ,COMMA it  can  be  customized  for  use  in  each  of  their  own  individual  institutions .PERIOD if  people  like  kitty  jones ,COMMA right ,COMMA a  shut-out ,COMMA a  private  music  teacher  and  mom  from  champagne ,COMMA illinois ,COMMA who  wanted  to  share  her  fantastic  music  content  with  the  world ,COMMA on  how  to  teach  kids  how  to  play  music .PERIOD her  material  is  now  used  over  600,000  times  per  month .PERIOD tremendous ,COMMA tremendous  use .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA a  lot  of  this  use  coming  from  unites  states ,COMMA k-through-12  schools  because  anyone  who  's  involved  in  a  school  scale  back ,COMMA the  first  thing  that  's  cut  is  the  music  curriculum  and  so  this  is  just  indicating  the  tremendous  thirst  for  this  kind  of  open ,COMMA free  content .PERIOD a  lot  of  teachers  are  using  this  stuff .PERIOD ok ,COMMA what  about  ripping ?QUESTIONMARK what  about  copying ,COMMA reusing ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK a  team  of  volunteers  at  the  university  of  texas  el  paso ,COMMA graduate  students  translating  this  engineering  super  textbook  ideas  and  within  about  a  week ,COMMA having  this  be  some  of  our  most  popular  material  in  widespread  use  all  over  latin  america  and  in  particular  in  mexico ,COMMA because  of  the  open  extensible  nature  of  this .PERIOD people ,COMMA volunteers  and  even  companies  that  are  translating  material  into  asian  languages  like  chinese ,COMMA japanese  and  thai ,COMMA to  spread  the  knowledge  even  further .PERIOD ok ,COMMA what  about  people  who  are  mixing ?QUESTIONMARK what  does  mixing  mean ?QUESTIONMARK mixing  means  building  customized  courses ,COMMA means  building  customized  books .PERIOD companies  like  national  instruments ,COMMA who  are  embedding  very  powerful ,COMMA interactive  simulations  into  the  materials ,COMMA so  that  we  can  go  way  beyond  our  regular  kind  of  textbook  to  an  experience  that  all  the  teaching  materials  are  things  you  can  actually  interact  with  and  play  around  with  and  actually  learn  as  you  do .PERIOD we've  been  working  with  teachers  without  borders  who  are  very  interested  in  mixing  our  materials .PERIOD they  're  going  to  be  using  connexions  as  their  platform  to  develop  and  deliver  teaching  materials  for  teaching  teachers  how  to  teach  in  84  countries  that  are  around  the  world .PERIOD twb  is  currently  in  iraq  training  20,000  teachers  supported  by  usaid  and  to  them ,COMMA this  idea  of  being  able  to  remix  and  customize  to  the  local  context  is  extraordinarily  important ,COMMA because  just  providing  free  content  to  people  has  actually  been  likened  by  people  in  the  developing  world  to  a  kind  of  cultural  imperialism ,COMMA that  if  you  do  n't  empower  people  with  the  ability  to  re-contextualize  the  material ,COMMA translate  it  into  their  own  language  and  take  ownership  of  it ,COMMA it  's  not  good .PERIOD ok ,COMMA other  organizations  we've  been  working  with ,COMMA uc  merced ,COMMA people  know  about  uc  merced .PERIOD it  's  a  new  university  in  california ,COMMA in  the  central  valley ,COMMA working  very  closely  with  community  colleges .PERIOD they  're  actually  developing  a  lot  of  their  science  and  engineering  curriculum  to  spread  widely  around  the  world  in  our  system  and  they  're  also  trying  to  develop  all  of  their  software  tools  completely  open-source .PERIOD we've  been  working  with  amd ,COMMA which  has  a  project  called  50  by  15 ,COMMA which  is  trying  to  bring  internet  connectivity  to  50  percent  of  the  world  's  population  by  2015 .PERIOD we  're  going  to  be  providing  content  to  them  in  a  whole  range  of  different  languages .PERIOD and  we've  also  been  working  with  a  number  of  other  organizations .PERIOD in  particular ,COMMA a  bunch  of  the  projects  that  are  funded  by  hewlett  foundation ,COMMA who  have  taken  a  real  leadership  role  in  this  area  of  open  content .PERIOD ok ,COMMA burn ,COMMA i  think  this  is  sort  of ,COMMA quite  interesting .PERIOD burn  is  the  idea  of  trying  to  create  the  physical  instantiation  of  one  of  these  courses .PERIOD and  i  think  a  lot  of  you  received ,COMMA i  think  all  of  you  received  one  of  these  music  books  in  your  gift  pack .PERIOD a  little  present  for  you .PERIOD just  to  tell  you  quickly  about  it ,COMMA this  is  an  engineering  textbook .PERIOD it  's  about  300  pages  long ,COMMA hardbound .PERIOD this  costs ,COMMA anybody  guess ?QUESTIONMARK how  much  would  it  cost  in  a  bookstore ?QUESTIONMARK audience ,COMMA 65  dollars .PERIOD richard  baraniuk ,COMMA this  costs  22  dollars  to  the  student .PERIOD why  does  it  cost  22  dollars ?QUESTIONMARK because  it  's  published  on  demand  and  it  's  developed  from  this  repository  of  open  materials .PERIOD if  this  book  were  to  be  published  by  a  regular  publisher ,COMMA it  would  cost  at  least  122  dollars .PERIOD so  what  we  're  seeing  is  moving  this  burning  or  publication  process  from  the  regular  sort  of  single-authored  book  towards  community-authored  materials  that  are  modular ,COMMA that  are  customized  to  each  individual  class  and  published  on  demand  very  inexpensively ,COMMA either  pushed  out  through  amazon ,COMMA or  published  directly  through  an  on-demand  press ,COMMA like  coop .PERIOD and  i  think  that  this  is  an  extraordinarily  interesting  area  because  there  is  tremendous  area  under  this  long  tail  in  publishing .PERIOD we  're  not  talking  about  the  harry  potter  end ,COMMA right  at  the  left  side .PERIOD we  're  talking  about  books  on  hyper  geometric  partial  differential  equations .PERIOD right ,COMMA books  that  might  sell  100  copies  a  year ,COMMA 1,000  copies  a  year .PERIOD there  is  tremendous  sustaining  revenue  under  this  long  tail  to  sustain  open  projects  like  ours ,COMMA but  also  to  sustain  this  new  emergence  of  on-demand  publishers ,COMMA like  coop ,COMMA who  produced  these  two  books .PERIOD and  i  think  one  of  the  things  that  you  should  take  away  from  this  talk ,COMMA is  that  there  's  an  impending  cut-out-the-middle-man ,COMMA disintermediation ,COMMA that  's  going  to  be  happening  in  the  publishing  industry ,COMMA and  it  's  going  to  reach  a  crescendo  over  the  next  few  years ,COMMA and  i  think  that  it  's  for  our  benefit ,COMMA really ,COMMA and  for  the  world  's  benefit .PERIOD ok ,COMMA so  what  are  the  enablers ?QUESTIONMARK what  's  really  making  all  of  this  happen ?QUESTIONMARK there  's  tons  of  technology ,COMMA and  the  only  piece  of  technology  that  i  really  want  to  talk  about  is  xml .PERIOD how  many  people  know  about  xml ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA great ,COMMA so  it  's  the  future  of  the  web ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  semantic  representation  of  comment ,COMMA content ,COMMA and  what  you  can  really  think  of  xml  in  this  case ,COMMA is  it  's  the  packaging  that  we  're  putting  around  these  pages .PERIOD remember  we  took  the  book ,COMMA tore  the  pages  out ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA what  the  xml  is  going  to  do  is  it  's  going  to  turn  those  pages  into  lego  blocks .PERIOD xml  are  the  nubs  on  the  lego  that  allow  us  to  combine  the  content  together  in  myriad  different  ways ,COMMA and  it  provides  us  a  framework  to  share  content .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  lets  you  take  this  ecosystem  in  its  primordial  state ,COMMA right ,COMMA of  all  this  content ,COMMA all  the  pages  you've  torn  out  of  books ,COMMA and  create  highly  sophisticated  learning  machines: .PERIOD books ,COMMA courses ,COMMA course  packs .PERIOD it  gives  you  the  ability  to  personalize  the  learning  experience  to  each  individual  student ,COMMA so  that  every  student  can  have  a  book  or  a  course  that  's  customized  to  their  learning  style ,COMMA their  context ,COMMA their  language  and  the  things  that  excite  them .PERIOD it  lets  you  reuse  the  same  materials  in  multiple  different  ways  and  surprising  new  ways .PERIOD it  lets  you  interconnect  ideas  indicating  how  fields  relate  to  each  other ,COMMA and  i  'll  just  give  you  my  personal  story .PERIOD we  came  up  with  this  six-and-a-half  years  ago  because  i  teach  the  stuff  in  the  red  box .PERIOD and  my  day  job ,COMMA as  chris  said ,COMMA i  'm  an  electrical  engineering  professor .PERIOD i  teach  signal  processing  and  my  challenge  was  to  show  that  this  math ,COMMA wow ,COMMA about  half  of  you  have  already  fallen  asleep  just  looking  at  the  equation ,COMMA but  this  seemingly  dry  math  is  actually  the  center  of  this  tremendously  powerful  web  that  links  technology ,COMMA that  links  really  cool  applications  like  music  synthesizers  to  tremendous  economic  opportunities ,COMMA but  also  governed  by  intellectual  property .PERIOD and  the  thing  that  i  realized  is  there  was  no  way  that  i ,COMMA as  an  engineer ,COMMA could  write  this  book  that  would  get  all  of  this  across .PERIOD we  needed  a  community  to  do  it  and  we  needed  new  tools  to  be  able  to  interconnect  these  ideas ,COMMA and  i  think  that  really ,COMMA in  a  sense ,COMMA what  we  're  trying  to  do  is  make  minsky  's  dream  come  to  a  reality ,COMMA where  you  can  imagine  all  the  books  in  a  library  actually  starting  to  talk  to  each  other .PERIOD and  people  who  are  teachers  out  here ,COMMA whoever  taught ,COMMA you  know  this  -- .PERIOD it  's  the  interconnections  between  ideas  that  teaching  is  really  all  about .PERIOD ok ,COMMA back  to  math .PERIOD imagine  this  is  possible  -- .PERIOD that  every  single  equation  that  you  click  on  in  one  of  your  new  e-texts  is  something  that  you  're  going  to  be  able  to  explore  and  experiment  with .PERIOD so  imagine  your  kid  's  algebra  textbook  in  seventh  grade .PERIOD you  can  click  on  every  single  equation  and  bring  up  a  little  tool  to  be  able  to  experiment  with  it ,COMMA tinker  with  it ,COMMA understand  it ,COMMA because  we  really  do  n't  understand  until  we  do .PERIOD the  same  type  of  mark-up ,COMMA like  mathml ,COMMA for  chemistry .PERIOD imagine  chemistry  textbooks  that  actually  understand  the  structure  of  how  molecules  are  formed .PERIOD imagine  music  xml  that  actually  lets  you  delve  into  the  semantic  structure  of  music ,COMMA play  with  it ,COMMA understand  it .PERIOD it  's  no  wonder  that  everybody  's  getting  into  it ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK even  the  three  wise  men .PERIOD ok ,COMMA the  second  big  enabler ,COMMA and  this  is  where  i  told  a  big  lie .PERIOD the  second  big  enabler  is  intellectual  property ,COMMA because  in  fact  i  got  up  here  and  i  talked  about  how  great  the  music  culture  is .PERIOD we  can  share  and  rip ,COMMA mix  and  burn ,COMMA but  in  fact  that  's  all  illegal .PERIOD and  we  would  be  accused  of  pirates  for  doing  that ,COMMA because  this  music  has  been  propertized .PERIOD it  's  now  owned ,COMMA right ,COMMA much  of  it  by  big  industries .PERIOD so ,COMMA really ,COMMA the  key  thing  here  is  we  cannot  let  this  happen .PERIOD we  cannot  let  this  napster  thing  happen  here .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  we  have  to  do  is  get  it  right  from  the  very  beginning  and  what  we  have  to  do  is  find  an  intellectual  property  framework  that  makes  sharing  safe ,COMMA and  makes  it  easily  understandable ,COMMA and  the  inspiration  here  is  taken  from  open-source  software ,COMMA things  like  linux  and  the  gpl .PERIOD and  the  ideas ,COMMA the  creative  commons  licenses .PERIOD how  many  people  have  heard  of  creative  commons ?QUESTIONMARK if  you  have  not ,COMMA you  must  learn  about  it .PERIOD creativecommonsorg .PERIOD at  the  bottom  of  every  piece  of  material  in  connexions  and  in  lots  of  other  projects ,COMMA you  can  find  their  logo .PERIOD clicking  on  that  logo  takes  you  to  an  absolute  no-nonsense ,COMMA human-readable  document ,COMMA a  deed ,COMMA that  tells  you  exactly  what  you  can  do  with  this  content .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA you  're  free  to  share  it ,COMMA to  do  all  of  these  things ,COMMA to  copy  it ,COMMA to  change  it ,COMMA even  to  make  commercial  use  of  it  as  long  as  you  attribute  the  author .PERIOD because  in  academic  publishing  and  much  of  educational  publishing ,COMMA it  's  really  this  idea  of  sharing  knowledge  and  making  impact  that  's  why  people  write ,COMMA not  necessarily  making  bucks .PERIOD we  're  not  talking  about  harry  potter ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK we  're  at  the  long  tail  end  here .PERIOD behind  that  is  the  legal  code ,COMMA so  if  you  want  to  very  carefully  construct  it ,COMMA and  creative  commons  is  taking  off  -- .PERIOD over  43  million  things  out  there ,COMMA licensed  with  a  creative  commons  license .PERIOD not  just  text ,COMMA but  music ,COMMA images ,COMMA video ,COMMA and  there  's  actually  a  tremendous  uptake  of  the  number  of  people  that  are  actually  licensing  music  to  make  it  free  for  people  who  do  this  whole  idea  of  re-sampling ,COMMA rip ,COMMA mixing ,COMMA burning  and  sharing .PERIOD so  i'd  like  to  conclude  with  just  the  last  few  points .PERIOD so ,COMMA we've  built  this  idea  of  a  commons .PERIOD people  are  using  it .PERIOD we  get  over  500,000  unique  visitors  per  month ,COMMA just  to  our  particular  site .PERIOD mit  open  courseware ,COMMA which  is  another  large  open-content  site ,COMMA gets  a  similar  number  of  hits ,COMMA but  how  do  we  protect  this ?QUESTIONMARK how  do  we  protect  it  into  the  future ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  first  thing  that  people  are  probably  thinking  is  quality  control ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK because  we  're  saying  that  anybody  can  contribute  things  to  this  commons .PERIOD anybody  can  contribute  anything .PERIOD so  that  could  be  a  problem .PERIOD it  did  n't  take  long  until  people  started  contributing  materials ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA on  lingerie ,COMMA which  is  actually  a  pretty  good  module .PERIOD the  only  problem  is  it  's  plagiarized  from  a  major  french  feminist  journal ,COMMA and  when  you  go  to  the  supposed  course  website ,COMMA it  points  to  a  lingerie-selling  website .PERIOD this  is  a  little  bit  of  a  problem ,COMMA so  we  clearly  need  some  kind  of  idea  of  quality  control ,COMMA and  this  is  really  where  the  idea  of  review  and  peer  review  comes  in .PERIOD ok ,COMMA you  come  to  ted .PERIOD why  do  you  come  to  ted ?QUESTIONMARK because  chris  and  his  team  have  ensured  that  things  are  very ,COMMA very  high  quality ,COMMA right ,COMMA and  so  we  need  to  be  able  to  do  the  same  thing .PERIOD and  we  need  to  be  able  to  design  structures  and  what  we  're  doing  is  designing  social  software  to  enable  anyone  to  build  their  own  peer  review  process ,COMMA and  we  call  these  things  lenses  and  basically  what  they  allow  is  anyone  out  there  to  develop  their  own  peer  review  process ,COMMA so  that  they  can  focus  on  the  content  in  the  repository  that  they  think  is  really  important  and  you  can  think  of  ted  as  a  potential  lens .PERIOD so  i'd  just  like  to  end  by  saying ,COMMA you  can  really  view  this  as  a  call  to  action .PERIOD connexions  and  open  content  is  all  about  sharing  knowledge .PERIOD all  of  you  here  are  tremendously  imbued  with  tremendous  amounts  of  knowledge  and  what  i'd  like  to  do  is  invite  each  and  every  one  of  you  to  contribute  to  this  project  and  other  projects  of  its  type ,COMMA because  i  think  together  we  can  truly  change  the  landscape  of  education  and  educational  publishing .PERIOD so ,COMMA thanks  very  much .PERIOD in  october  2010 ,COMMA the  justice  league  of  america  will  be  teaming  up  with  the  99 .PERIOD icons  like  batman ,COMMA superman ,COMMA wonder  woman  and  their  colleagues  will  be  teaming  up  with  icons  jabbar ,COMMA noora ,COMMA jami  and  their  colleagues .PERIOD it  's  a  story  of  intercultural  intersections .PERIOD and  what  better  group  to  have  this  conversation  than  those  that  grew  out  of  fighting  fascism  in  their  respective  histories  and  geographies ?QUESTIONMARK as  fascism  took  over  europe  in  the  1930s ,COMMA an  unlikely  reaction  came  out  of  north  america .PERIOD as  christian  iconography  got  changed ,COMMA and  swastikas  were  created  out  of  crucifixes ,COMMA batman  and  superman  were  created  by  jewish  young  men  in  the  united  states  and

.PERIOD and  all  of  them ,COMMA just  like  the  prophets  who  get  their  message  from  god  through  gabriel ,COMMA get  their  message  from  above .PERIOD peter  parker  is  in  a  library  in

he  sees  it  as  an  omen  to  become  batman .PERIOD superman  is  not  only  sent  to  earth  from  the  heavens ,COMMA or  krypton ,COMMA but  he  's  sent  in  a  pod ,COMMA much  like  moses  was  on  the  nile .PERIOD and  you  hear  the  voice  of  his  father ,COMMA jor-el ,COMMA saying  to  earth ,COMMA i  have  sent  to  you  my  only  son  these  are  clearly  biblical  archetypes ,COMMA and  the  thinking  behind  that  was  to  create  positive ,COMMA globally-resonating  storylines  that  could  be  tied  to  the  same  things  that  other  people  were  pulling  mean  messages  out  of .PERIOD because  then  the  person  that  's  using  religion  for  the  wrong  purpose  just  becomes  a  bad  man  with  a  bad  message .PERIOD and  it  's  only  by  linking  positive  things  that  the  negative  can  be  delinked .PERIOD this  is  the  kind  of  thinking  that  went  into  creating  the  99 .PERIOD the  99  references  the  99  attributes  of  allah  in  the  koran ,COMMA things  like  generosity  and  mercy  and  foresight  and  wisdom  and  dozens  of  others  that  no  two  people  in  the  world  would  disagree  about .PERIOD it  does  n't

those  are  basic  human  values .PERIOD and  so  the  backstory  of  the  99  takes  place  in  1258 ,COMMA which  history  tells  us  the  mongols  invaded  baghdad  and  destroyed  it .PERIOD all  the  books  from  bait  al-hikma  library ,COMMA the  most  famous  library  in  its  day ,COMMA were  thrown  in  the  tigris  river ,COMMA and  the  tigris  changes  color  with  ink .PERIOD it  's  a  story  passed  on  generation  after  generation .PERIOD i  rewrote  that  story .PERIOD and  in  my  version ,COMMA the  librarians  find  out  that  this  is  going  to  happen ,COMMA and  here  's  a  side  note ,COMMA if  you  want  a  comic  book  to  do  well ,COMMA make  the  librarians  the  hero .PERIOD it  always  works  well .PERIOD so  the  librarians  find  out  and  they  get  together  a  special  solution ,COMMA a  chemical  solution  called  king  's  water ,COMMA that  when  mixed  with  99  stones  would  be  able  to  save  all  that  culture  and  history  in  the  books .PERIOD but  the  mongols  get  there  first .PERIOD the  books  and  the  solution  get  thrown  in  the  tigris  river .PERIOD some  librarians  escape ,COMMA and  over  the  course  of  days  and  weeks ,COMMA they  dip  the  stones  into  the  tigris  and  suck  up  that  collective  wisdom  that  we  all  think  is  lost  to  civilization .PERIOD those  stones  have  been  smuggled  as  three  prayer  beads  of  33  stones  each  through  arabia  into  andalusia  in  spain ,COMMA where  they  're  safe  for  200  years .PERIOD but  in  1492 ,COMMA two  important  things  happen .PERIOD the  first  is  the  fall  of  granada ,COMMA the  last  muslim  enclave  in  europe .PERIOD the  second  is  columbus  finally  gets  funded  to  go  to  india ,COMMA but  he  gets  lost .PERIOD so  33  of  the  stones  are  smuggled  onto  the  nina ,COMMA the  pinta  and  the  santa  maria  and  are  spread  in  the  new  world .PERIOD thirty-three  go  on  the  silk  road  to  china ,COMMA south  asia  and  southeast  asia .PERIOD and  33  are  spread  between  europe ,COMMA the  middle  east  and  africa .PERIOD and  now  it  's  2010 ,COMMA and  there  are  99  heroes  from  99  different  countries .PERIOD now  it  's  very  easy  to  assume  that  those  books ,COMMA because  they  were  from  a  library  called  bait  al-hikma ,COMMA were  muslim  books ,COMMA but  that  's  not  the  case  because  the  caliph  that  built  that  library ,COMMA his  name  was  al-ma  'mun ,COMMA he  was  harun  al-rashid  's  son .PERIOD he  had  told  his  advisers ,COMMA get  me  all  the  scholars  to  translate  any  book  they  can  get  their  hands  onto  into  arabic ,COMMA and  i  will  pay  them  its  weight  in  gold  after  a  while ,COMMA his  advisers  complained .PERIOD they  said ,COMMA your  highness ,COMMA the  scholars  are  cheating .PERIOD they  're  writing  in  big  handwriting  to  take  more  gold  to  which  he  said ,COMMA let  them  be ,COMMA because  what  they  're  giving  us  is  worth  a  lot  more  than  what  we  're  paying  them  so  the  idea  of  an  open  architecture ,COMMA an  open  knowledge ,COMMA is  not  new  to  my  neck  of  the  desert .PERIOD the  concept  centers  on  something  called  the  noor  stones .PERIOD noor  is  arabic  for  light .PERIOD so  these  99  stones ,COMMA a  few  kind  of  rules  in  the  game ,COMMA number  one ,COMMA you  do  n't  choose  the  stone .PERIOD the  stone  chooses  you .PERIOD there  's  a  king  arthur  element  to  the  storyline ,COMMA okay .PERIOD number  two ,COMMA all  of  the  99 ,COMMA when  they  first  get  their  stone ,COMMA or  their  power ,COMMA abuse  it .PERIOD they  use  it  for  self-interest .PERIOD and  there  's  a  very  strong  message  in  there  that  when  you  start  abusing  your  stone ,COMMA you  get  taken  advantage  of  by  people  who  will  exploit  your  powers ,COMMA okay .PERIOD number  three ,COMMA the  99  stones  all  have  within  them  a  mechanism  that  self-updates .PERIOD now  there  are  two  groups  that  exist  within  the  muslim  world .PERIOD everybody  believes  the  koran  is  for  all  time  and  all  place .PERIOD some  believe  that  means  that  the  original  interpretation  from  a  couple  thousand  years  ago  is  what  's  relevant  today .PERIOD i  do  n't  belong  there .PERIOD then  there  's  a  group  that  believes  the  koran  is  a  living ,COMMA breathing  document .PERIOD and  i  captured  that  idea  within  these  stones  that  self-update .PERIOD now  the  main  bad  guy ,COMMA rughal ,COMMA does  not  want  these  stones  to  update .PERIOD so  he  's  trying  to  get  them  to  stop  updating .PERIOD he  cannot  use  the  stones ,COMMA but  he  can  stop  them .PERIOD and  by  stopping  them ,COMMA he  has  more  of  a  fascist  agenda ,COMMA where  he  gets  some  of  the  99  to  work  for  him  -- .PERIOD they  're  all  wearing  cookie-cutter ,COMMA same  color  uniforms .PERIOD they  're  not  allowed  to  individually  express  who  they  are  and  what  they  are .PERIOD and  he  controls  them  from  the  top  down  -- .PERIOD whereas  when  they  work  for  the  other  side ,COMMA eventually ,COMMA when  they  find  out  this  is  the  wrong  person ,COMMA they've  been  manipulated ,COMMA they  actually ,COMMA each  one  has  a  different ,COMMA colorful  kind  of  dress .PERIOD and  the  last  point  about  the  99  noor  stones  is  this .PERIOD so  the  99  work  in  teams  of  three .PERIOD why  three ?QUESTIONMARK a  couple  of  reasons .PERIOD number  one ,COMMA we  have  a  thing  within  islam  that  you  do  n't  leave  a  boy  and  a  girl  alone  together ,COMMA because  the  third  person  is  temptation  or  the  devil ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  that  's  there  in  all  cultures ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK but  this  is  not  about  religion ,COMMA it  's  not  about  proselytizing .PERIOD there  's  this  very  strong  social  message  that  needs  to  get  to  kind  of  the  deepest  crevices  of  intolerance .PERIOD and  the  only  way  to  get  there  is  to  kind  of  play  the  game .PERIOD and  so  this  is  the  way  i  dealt  with  it .PERIOD they  work  in  teams  of  three ,COMMA two  boys  and  a  girl ,COMMA two  girls  and  a  boy ,COMMA three  boys ,COMMA three  girls ,COMMA no  problem .PERIOD and  the  swiss  psychoanalyst ,COMMA carl  jung ,COMMA also  spoke  about  the  importance  of  the  number  three  in  all  cultures ,COMMA so  i  figure  i  'm  covered .PERIOD well .PERIOD i  got  accused  in  a  few  blogs  that  i  was  actually  sent  by  the  pope  to  preach  the  trinity  and  catholicism  in  the  middle  east ,COMMA so  you ,COMMA you  believe  who  you  want .PERIOD i  gave  you  my  version  of  the  story .PERIOD so  here  's  some  of  the  characters  that  we  have .PERIOD mujiba ,COMMA from  malaysia ,COMMA her  main  power  is  she  's  able  to  answer  any  question .PERIOD she  's  the  trivial  pursuit  queen ,COMMA if  you  want .PERIOD but  when  she  first  gets  her  power ,COMMA she  starts  going  on

kind ,COMMA the  generous .PERIOD i  'm  like ,COMMA are  all  the  girls  going  to  be  kind  and  merciful  and  the  guys  all  strong ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  like ,COMMA you  know  what ,COMMA i've

thought  perhaps  if  i  was  hanging  on  long  enough ,COMMA that  would  guide  me  through  the  18  minutes .PERIOD okay .PERIOD i  am  known  as  captain  organic ,COMMA and  that  's  a  philosophical  position  as  well  as  an  aesthetic  position .PERIOD but  today  what  i'd  like  to  talk  to  you  about  is  that  love  of  form  and  how  form  can  touch  people  's  soul

how  that  is  produced .PERIOD these  are  the  invisible  things  that  you  never  see  in  your  life .PERIOD this  is  the  background  noise  of  industrial  design .PERIOD that  is  like  an

.PERIOD i  'm  also  interested  in  growth  patterns ,COMMA the  unbridled  way  that  nature  grows  things  so  you  're  not  restricted  by  form  at  all .PERIOD these  interrelated  forms ,COMMA they  do  inspire  everything  i  do  although  i  might  end  up  making  something  incredibly  simple .PERIOD this  is  a  detail  of  a  chair  that  i've  designed  in  magnesium .PERIOD

.PERIOD this  is  an  absolutely  beautiful  way  of  working .PERIOD it  's  a  godly  way  of  working .PERIOD it  's  organic  and  it  's  essential .PERIOD it  's  an  absolutely  fat-free

.PERIOD there  's  tuareg  shoes  from  north  africa .PERIOD there  's  a  kifwebe  mask .PERIOD these  are  my  sculptures .PERIOD a  copper  jelly  mold .PERIOD it  sounds  like  some  quiz  show

,COMMA i  learned  a  lot  of  things  about  ballooning ,COMMA especially  at  the  end  of  these  balloon  flights  around  the  world  i  did  with  brian  jones .PERIOD when  i  took  this  picture ,COMMA the  window  was  frozen  because  of  the  moisture  of  the  night .PERIOD and  on  the  other  side  there  was  a  rising  sun .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  see  that  on  the  other  side  of  ice  you  have  the  unknown ,COMMA you  have  the  non-obvious ,COMMA you  have  the  non-seen ,COMMA for  the  people  who  do  n't  dare  to  go  through  the  ice .PERIOD there  are  so  many  people  who  prefer  to  suffer  in  the  ice  they  know  instead  of  taking  the  risk  of  going  through  the  ice  to  see  what  there  is  on  the  other  side .PERIOD and  i  think  that  's  one  of  the  main  problems  of  our  society .PERIOD we  learn ,COMMA maybe  not  the  famous  ted  audience ,COMMA but  so  many  other  people  learn ,COMMA that  the  unknown ,COMMA the  doubts ,COMMA the  question  marks  are  dangerous .PERIOD and  we  have  to  resist  to  the  changes .PERIOD we  have  to  keep  everything  under  control .PERIOD well ,COMMA the  unknown  is  part  of  life .PERIOD and  in  that  sense ,COMMA ballooning  is  a  beautiful  metaphor .PERIOD because  in  the  balloon ,COMMA like  in  life ,COMMA we  go  very  well  in  unforeseen  directions .PERIOD we  want  to  go  in  a  direction ,COMMA but  the  winds  push  us  in  another  direction ,COMMA like  in  life .PERIOD and  as  long  as  we  fight  horizontally ,COMMA against  life ,COMMA against  the  winds ,COMMA against  what  's  happening  to  us ,COMMA life  is  a  nightmare .PERIOD how  do  we  steer  a  balloon ?QUESTIONMARK by  understanding  that  the  atmosphere  is  made  out  of  several  different  layers  of  wind  which  all  have  different  direction .PERIOD so ,COMMA then ,COMMA we  understand  that  if  we  want  to  change  our  trajectory ,COMMA in  life ,COMMA or  in  the  balloon ,COMMA we  have  to  change  altitude .PERIOD changing  altitude ,COMMA in  life ,COMMA that  means  raising  to  another  psychological ,COMMA philosophical ,COMMA spiritual  level .PERIOD in  ballooning ,COMMA or  in  life ,COMMA how  do  we  change  altitude ?QUESTIONMARK how  do  we  go  from  the  metaphor  to  something  more  practical  that  we  can  really  use  every  day ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA in  a  balloon  it  's  easy ,COMMA we  have  ballast .PERIOD and  when  we  drop  the  ballast  overboard  we  climb .PERIOD sand ,COMMA water ,COMMA all  the  equipment  we  do  n't  need  anymore .PERIOD and  i  think  in  life  it  should  be  exactly  like  this .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA when  people  speak  about  pioneering  spirit ,COMMA very  often  they  believe  that  pioneers  are  the  ones  who  have  new  ideas .PERIOD it  's  not  true .PERIOD the  pioneers  are  not  the  ones  who  have  new  ideas ,COMMA because  new  ideas  are  so  easy  to  have .PERIOD we  just  close  our  eyes  for  a  minute  we  all  come  back  with  a  lot  of  new  ideas .PERIOD no ,COMMA the  pioneer  is  the  one  who  allows  himself  to  throw  overboard  a  lot  of  ballast .PERIOD habits ,COMMA certainties ,COMMA convictions ,COMMA exclamation  marks ,COMMA paradigms ,COMMA dogmas .PERIOD and  when  we  are  able  to  do  that ,COMMA what  happens ?QUESTIONMARK life  is  not  anymore  just  one  line  going  in  one  direction  in  one  dimension .PERIOD no .PERIOD life  is  going  to  be  made  out  of  all  the  possible  lines  that  go  in  all  the  possible  directions  in  three  dimensions .PERIOD and  pioneering  spirit  will  be  each  time  we  allow  ourselves  to  explore  this  vertical  axis .PERIOD of  course  not  just  like  the  atmosphere  in  the  balloon ,COMMA but  in  life  itself .PERIOD explore  this  vertical  axis ,COMMA that  means  explore  all  the  different  ways  to  do ,COMMA all  the  different  ways  to  behave ,COMMA all  the  different  ways  to  think ,COMMA before  we  find  the  one  that  goes  in  the  direction  we  wish .PERIOD this  is  very  practical .PERIOD this  can  be  in  politics .PERIOD this  can  be  in  spirituality .PERIOD this  can  be  in  environment ,COMMA in  finance ,COMMA in  education  of  children .PERIOD i  deeply  believe  that  life  is  a  much  greater  adventure  if  we  manage  to  do  politics  without  the  trench  between  the  left  and  the  right  wing .PERIOD because  we  will  throw  away  these  political  dogmas .PERIOD i  deeply  believe  that  we  can  make  much  more  protection  of  the  environment  if  we  get  rid ,COMMA if  we  throw  overboard  this  fundamentalism  that  some  of  the  greens  have  showed  in  the  past .PERIOD and  that  we  can  aim  for  much  higher  spirituality  if  we  get  rid  of  the  religious  dogmas .PERIOD throwing  overboard ,COMMA as  ballast ,COMMA to  change  our  direction .PERIOD well ,COMMA these  basically  are  things  i  believed  in  such  a  long  time .PERIOD but  actually  i  had  to  go  around  the  world  in  a  balloon  to  be  invited  to  talk  about  it .PERIOD it  's  clear  that  it  's  not  easy  to  know  which  ballast  to  drop  and  which  altitude  to  take .PERIOD sometime  we  need  friends ,COMMA family  members  or  a  psychiatrist .PERIOD well ,COMMA in  balloons  we  need  weather  men ,COMMA the  one  who  calculate  the  direction  of  each  layer  of  wind ,COMMA at  which  altitude ,COMMA in  order  to  help  the  balloonist .PERIOD but  sometimes  it  's  very  paradoxical .PERIOD when  brian  jones  and  i  were  flying  around  the  world ,COMMA the  weather  man  asked  us ,COMMA one  day ,COMMA to  fly  quite  low ,COMMA and  very  slow .PERIOD and  when  we  calculated  we  thought  we  're  never  going  to  make  it  around  the  world  at  that  speed .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  disobeyed .PERIOD we  flew  much  higher ,COMMA and  double  the  speed .PERIOD and  i  was  so  proud  to  have  found  that  jetstream  that  i  called  the  weather  man ,COMMA and  i  told  him ,COMMA hey ,COMMA guy ,COMMA do  n't  you  think  we  're  good  pilots  up  there ?QUESTIONMARK we  fly  twice  the  speed  you  predicted .PERIOD and  he  told  me ,COMMA do  n't  do  that .PERIOD go  down  immediately  in  order  to  slow  down .PERIOD and  i  started  to  argue .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA i  'm  not  going  to  do  that .PERIOD we  do  n't  have  enough  gas  to  fly  so  slow .PERIOD and  he  told  me ,COMMA yes ,COMMA but  with  the  low  pressure  you  have  on  your  left  if  you  fly  too  fast ,COMMA in  a  couple  of  hours  you  will  turn  left  and  end  up  at  the  north  pole .PERIOD and  then  he  asked  me ,COMMA and  this  is  something  i  will  never  forget  in  my  life ,COMMA he  just  asked  me ,COMMA you  're  the  good  pilot  up  there .PERIOD what  do  you  really  want ?QUESTIONMARK you  want  to  go  very  fast  in  the  wrong  direction ,COMMA or  slowly  in  the  good  direction ?QUESTIONMARK and  this  is  why  you  need  weathermen .PERIOD this  is  why  you  need  people  with  long-term  vision .PERIOD and  this  is  precisely  what  fails  in  the  political  visions  we  have  now ,COMMA in  the  political  governments .PERIOD we  are  burning ,COMMA as  you  heard ,COMMA so  much  energy ,COMMA not  understanding  that  such  an  unsustainable  way  of  life  cannot  last  for  long .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  went  down  actually .PERIOD we  slowed  down .PERIOD and  we  went  through  moments  of  fears  because  we  had  no  idea  how  the  little  amount  of  gas  we  had  in  the  balloon  could  allow  us  to  travel  45,000  kilometers .PERIOD but  we  were  expected  to  have  doubts .PERIOD we  're  expected  to  have  fears .PERIOD and  actually  this  is  where  the  adventure  really  started .PERIOD when  we  were  flying  over  the  sahara  and  india  it  was  nice  holidays .PERIOD we  could  land  anytime  and  fly  back  home  with  an  airplane .PERIOD in  the  middle  of  the  pacific ,COMMA when  you  do  n't  have  the  good  winds ,COMMA you  cannot  land ,COMMA you  cannot  go  back .PERIOD that  's  a  crisis .PERIOD that  's  the  moment  when  you  have  to  wake  up  from  the  automatic  way  of  thinking .PERIOD that  's  the  moment  when  you  have  to  motivate  your  inner  potential ,COMMA your  creativity .PERIOD that  's  when  you  throw  out  all  the  ballast ,COMMA all  the  certainties ,COMMA in  order  to  adapt  to  the  new  situation .PERIOD and  actually ,COMMA we  changed  completely  our  flight  plan .PERIOD we  changed  completely  our  strategy .PERIOD and  after  20  days  we  landed  successfully  in  egypt .PERIOD but  if  i  show  you  this  picture  it  's  not  to  tell  you  how  happy  we  were .PERIOD it  's  to  show  you  how  much  gas  was  left  in  the  last  bottles .PERIOD we  took  off  with  37  tons  of  liquid  propane .PERIOD we  landed  with  40  kilos .PERIOD when  i  saw  that ,COMMA i  made  a  promise  to  myself .PERIOD i  made  a  promise  that  the  next  time  i  would  fly  around  the  world ,COMMA it  would  be  with  no  fuel ,COMMA independent  from  fossil  energies ,COMMA in  order  to  be  safe ,COMMA not  to  be  threatened  by  the  fuel  gauge .PERIOD i  had  no  idea  how  it  was  possible .PERIOD i  just  thought  it  's  a  dream  and  i  want  to  do  it .PERIOD and  when  the  capsule  of  my  balloon  was  introduced  officially  in  the  air  and  space  museum  in  washington ,COMMA together  with  the  airplane  of  charles  lindbergh ,COMMA with  apollo  11 ,COMMA with  the  wright  brothers  flyer ,COMMA with  chuck  yeager  's  61 ,COMMA i  had  really  a  thought  then .PERIOD i  thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA the  20th  century ,COMMA that  was  brilliant .PERIOD it  allowed  to  do  all  those  things  there .PERIOD but  it  will  not  be  possible  in  the  future  any  more .PERIOD it  takes  too  much  energy .PERIOD it  will  cost  too  much .PERIOD it  will  be  prohibited  because  we  'll  have  to  save  our  natural  resources  in  a  few  decades  from  now .PERIOD so  how  can  we  perpetuate  this  pioneering  spirit  with  something  that  will  be  independent  from  fossil  energy ?QUESTIONMARK and  this  is  when  the  project  solar  impulse  really  started  to  turn  in  my  head .PERIOD and  i  think  it  's  a  nice  metaphor  also  for  the  21st  century .PERIOD pioneering  spirit  should  continue ,COMMA but  on  another  level .PERIOD not  to  conquer  the  planet  or  space ,COMMA not  anymore ,COMMA it  has  been  done ,COMMA but  rather  to  improve  the  quality  of  life .PERIOD how  can  we  go  through  the  ice  of  certainty  in  order  to  make  the  most  incredible  a  possible  thing ?QUESTIONMARK what  is  today  completely  impossible ,COMMA get  rid  of  our  dependency  on  fossil  energy .PERIOD if  you  tell  to  people ,COMMA we  want  to  be  independent  from  fossil  energy  in  our  world ,COMMA people  will  laugh  at  you ,COMMA except  here ,COMMA where  crazy  people  are  invited  to  speak .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  idea  is  that  if  we  fly  around  the  world  in  a  solar  powered  airplane ,COMMA using  absolutely  no  fuel ,COMMA nobody  ever  could  say  in  the  future  that  it  's  impossible  to  do  it  for  cars ,COMMA for  heating  systems ,COMMA for  computers ,COMMA and  so  on  and  so  on .PERIOD well ,COMMA solar  power  airplanes  are  not  new .PERIOD they  have  flown  in  the  past ,COMMA but  without  saving  capabilities ,COMMA without  batteries .PERIOD which  means  that  they  have  more  proven  the  limits  of  renewable  energies  than  the  potential  of  it .PERIOD if  we  want  to  show  the  potential ,COMMA we  have  to  fly  day  and  night .PERIOD that  means  to  load  the  batteries  during  the  flight ,COMMA in  order  to  spend  the  night  on  the  batteries ,COMMA and  fly  the  next  day  again .PERIOD it  has  been  made ,COMMA already ,COMMA on  remote  controlled  little  airplane  models ,COMMA without  pilots .PERIOD but  it  stays  an  anecdote  because  the  public  could  n't  identify  to  it .PERIOD i  think  you  need  a  pilot  in  the  plane  that  can  talk  to  the  universities ,COMMA that  can  talk  to  students ,COMMA talk  to  politicians  during  the  flight ,COMMA and  really  make  it  a  human  adventure .PERIOD for  that ,COMMA unfortunately ,COMMA four  meters  wingspan  is  not  enough .PERIOD you  need  64  meter  wingspan .PERIOD 64  meter  wingspan  to  carry  one  pilot ,COMMA the  batteries ,COMMA flies  slowly  enough  with  the  aerodynamic  efficiency .PERIOD why  that ?QUESTIONMARK because  fuel  is  not  easy  to  replace .PERIOD that  's  for  sure .PERIOD and  with  200  square  meters  of  solar  power  on  our  plane ,COMMA we  can  produce  the  same  energy  than  200  little  lightbulbs .PERIOD that  means  a  christmas  tree ,COMMA a  big  christmas  tree .PERIOD so  the  question  is ,COMMA how  can  you  carry  a  pilot  around  the  world  with  an  airplane  that  uses  the  same  amount  of  energy  as  a  big  christmas  tree ?QUESTIONMARK people  will  tell  you  it  's  impossible ,COMMA and  that  's  exactly  why  we  try  to  do  it .PERIOD we  launched  the  project  with  my  colleague  andre  borschberg  six  years  ago .PERIOD we  have  now  70  people  in  the  team  working  on  it .PERIOD we  have  gone  through  the  stages  of  simulation ,COMMA design ,COMMA computing ,COMMA preparing  the  construction  of  the  first  prototype .PERIOD that  has  been  achieved  after  two  years  of  work .PERIOD cockpit ,COMMA propeller ,COMMA engine .PERIOD just  the  fuselage  here ,COMMA it  's  so  light .PERIOD it  's  not  designed  by  an  artist ,COMMA but  it  could  be .PERIOD 50  kilos  for  the  entire  fuselage .PERIOD couple  of  kilos  more  for  the  wing  spars .PERIOD this  is  the  complete  structure  of  the  airplane .PERIOD and  one  month  ago  we  have  unveiled  it .PERIOD you  cannot  imagine  how  it  is  for  a  team  who  has  been  working  six  years  on  it  to  show  that  it  's  not  only  a  dream  and  a  vision ,COMMA it  's  a  real  airplane .PERIOD a  real  airplane  that  we  could  finally  present .PERIOD and  what  's  the  goal  now ?QUESTIONMARK the  goal  is  to  take  off ,COMMA end  of  this  year  for  the  first  test ,COMMA but  mainly  next  year ,COMMA spring  or  summer ,COMMA take  off ,COMMA on  our  own  power ,COMMA without  additional  help ,COMMA without  being  towed ,COMMA climb  to  9,000  meters  altitude .PERIOD the  same  time  we  load  the  batteries ,COMMA we  run  the  engines ,COMMA and  when  we  get  at  the  maximum  height ,COMMA we  arrive  at  the  beginning  of  the  night .PERIOD and  there ,COMMA there  will  be  just  one  goal ,COMMA just  one ,COMMA reach  the  next  sunrise  before  the  batteries  are  empty .PERIOD and  this  is  exactly  the  symbol  of  our  world .PERIOD if  our  airplane  is  too  heavy ,COMMA if  the  pilot  wastes  energy ,COMMA we  'll  never  make  it  through  the  night .PERIOD and  in  our  world ,COMMA if  we  keep  on  spoiling ,COMMA wasting  our  energy  resources ,COMMA if  we  keep  on  building  things  that  consume  so  much  energy  that  most  of  the  companies  now  go  bankrupt ,COMMA it  's  clear  that  we  'll  never  give  the  planet  to  the  next  generation  without  a  major  problem .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  see  that  this  airplane  is  more  a  symbol .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  it  will  transport  200  people  in  the  next  years .PERIOD but  when  lindbergh  crossed  the  atlantic ,COMMA the  payload  was  also  just  sufficient  for  one  person  and  some  fuel .PERIOD and  20  years  later  there  were  200  people  in  every  airplane  crossing  the  atlantic .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  have  to  start ,COMMA and  show  the  example .PERIOD a  little  bit  like  on  this  picture  here .PERIOD this  is  a  painting  from  magritte ,COMMA in  the  museum  in  holland  that  i  love  so  much .PERIOD it  's  a  pipe ,COMMA and  it  's  written ,COMMA this  is  not  a  pipe .PERIOD this  is  not  an  airplane .PERIOD this  is  a  symbol  of  what  we  can  achieve  when  we  believe  in  the  impossible ,COMMA when  we  have  a  team ,COMMA when  we  have  pioneering  spirit ,COMMA and  especially  when  we  understand  that  all  the  certainties  we  have  should  be  thrown  overboard .PERIOD what  pleases  me  very  much  is  that  in  the  beginning  i  thought  that  we  would  have  to  fly  around  the  world  with  no  fuel  in  order  to  have  our  message  been  understood .PERIOD and  more  and  more ,COMMA we  're  invited  around  the  world  with  andre  to  talk  about  that  project ,COMMA to  talk  about  the  symbol  of  it ,COMMA invited  by  politicians ,COMMA invited  in  energy  forums ,COMMA in  order  to  show  that  it  's  not  anymore  completely  stupid  to  think  about  getting  rid  of  the  dependency  on  fossil  energies .PERIOD so ,COMMA through  speeches  like  this  one  today ,COMMA through  interviews ,COMMA through  meetings ,COMMA our  goal  is  to  get  as  many  people  possible  on  the  team .PERIOD the  success  will  not  come  if  we  just ,COMMA quote ,COMMA unquote ,COMMA fly  around  the  world  in  a  solar-powered  airplane .PERIOD no ,COMMA the  success  will  come  if  enough  people  are  motivated  to  do  exactly  the  same  in  their  daily  life ,COMMA save  energy ,COMMA go  to  renewables .PERIOD and  this  is  possible .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA with  the  technologies  we  have  today ,COMMA we  can  save  between  30  and  50  percent  of  the  energy  of  a  country  in  europe .PERIOD and  we  can  solve  half  of  the  rest  with  renewables .PERIOD it  leaves  25  or  30  percent  for  oil ,COMMA gas ,COMMA coal ,COMMA nuclear ,COMMA or  whatever .PERIOD this  is  acceptable .PERIOD this  is  why  all  the  people  who  believe  in  this  type  of  spirit  are  welcome  to  be  on  that  team .PERIOD you  can  just  go  on  solarimpulsecom ,COMMA subscribe  to  just  be  informed  of  what  we  're  doing .PERIOD but  much  more ,COMMA to  get  advices ,COMMA to  give  your  comments ,COMMA to  spread  the  word  that  if  it  's  possible  in  the  air ,COMMA of  course  it  's  possible  in  the  ground .PERIOD and  each  time  we  have  some  ice  in  the  future ,COMMA we  have  to  know  that  life  will  be  great ,COMMA and  the  success  will  be  brilliant  if  we  dare  to  overcome  our  fear  of  the  ice ,COMMA to  go  through  the  obstacle ,COMMA to  go  through  the  problem ,COMMA in  order  to  see  what  there  is  on  the  other  side .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  see ,COMMA this  is  what  we  're  doing  on  our  side .PERIOD everyone  has  his  goal ,COMMA has  his  dreams ,COMMA has  his  visions .PERIOD the  question  i  leave  you  with  now  is  which  is  the  ballast  you  would  like  to  throw  overboard ?QUESTIONMARK which  will  be  the  altitude  at  which  you  would  like  to  fly  in  your  life ,COMMA to  get  to  the  success  that  you  wish  to  have ,COMMA to  get  to  the  point  that  really  belongs  to  you ,COMMA with  the  potential  you  have ,COMMA and  the  one  you  can  really  fulfill ?QUESTIONMARK because  the  most  renewable  energy  we  have  is  our  own  potential ,COMMA and  our  own  passion .PERIOD so ,COMMA let  's  go  for  it ,COMMA and  i  wish  you  an  excellent  adventure  in  the  wings  of  the  future .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  have  to  tell  you  i  'm  both  challenged  and  excited .PERIOD my  excitement  is ,COMMA i  get  a  chance  to  give  something  back .PERIOD my  challenge  is ,COMMA the  shortest  seminar  i  usually  do  is  50  hours .PERIOD i  'm  not  exaggerating .PERIOD i  do  weekends ,COMMA and  what  i  do ,COMMA i  do  even  more  than  that ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA coach  people ,COMMA but  i  'm  into  immersion .PERIOD because  how  did  you  learn  language ?QUESTIONMARK you  did  n't  learn  it  by  just  learning  principles ,COMMA you  got  in  it  and  you  did  it  so  often  that  it  became  real .PERIOD and  the  bottom  line  of  why  i  'm  here ,COMMA besides  being  a  crazy  mofo ,COMMA is  that  i  'm  really  in  a  position ,COMMA i  'm  not  here  to  motivate  you ,COMMA obviously .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  that .PERIOD and  a  lot  of  times  that  's  what  people  think  i  do ,COMMA and  it  's  the  furthest  thing  from  it .PERIOD what  happens ,COMMA though ,COMMA is  people  say  to  me ,COMMA i  do  n't  need  any  motivation .PERIOD and  i  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA that  's  interesting .PERIOD that  's  not  what  i  do .PERIOD i  'm  the  why  guy .PERIOD i  want  to  know  why  you  do  what  you  do .PERIOD what  is  your  motive  for  action ?QUESTIONMARK what  is  it  that  drives  you  in  your  life  today ?QUESTIONMARK not  10  years  ago .PERIOD or  are  you  running  the  same  pattern ?QUESTIONMARK because  i  believe  that  the  invisible  force  of  internal  drive ,COMMA activated ,COMMA is  the  most  important  thing  in  the  world .PERIOD i  'm  here  because  i  believe  emotion  is  the  force  of  life .PERIOD all  of  us  here  have  great  minds .PERIOD you  know ?QUESTIONMARK most  of  us  here  have  great  minds ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK i  do  n't  know  about  another  category ,COMMA but  we  all  know  how  to  think .PERIOD and  with  our  minds  we  can  rationalize  anything .PERIOD we  can  make  anything  happen .PERIOD we  can ,COMMA i  agree  with  what  was  described  a  few  days  ago ,COMMA about  this  idea  that  people  work  in  their  self-interest .PERIOD but  we  all  know  that  that  's  bullshit  at  times .PERIOD you  do  n't  work  in  your  self-interest  all  the  time ,COMMA because  when  emotion  comes  into  it ,COMMA the  wiring  changes  in  the  way  it  functions .PERIOD and  so  it  's  wonderful  for  us  to  think  intellectually  about  how  the  life  of  the  world  is ,COMMA and  especially  those  who  are  very  smart ,COMMA we  can  play  this  game  in  our  head .PERIOD but  i  really  want  to  know  what  's  driving  you .PERIOD and  what  i  would  like  to  maybe  invite  you  to  do  by  the  end  of  this  talk  is  explore  where  you  are  today ,COMMA for  two  reasons .PERIOD one ,COMMA so  that  you  can  contribute  more .PERIOD and  two ,COMMA so  that  hopefully  we  can  not  just  understand  other  people  more ,COMMA but  maybe  appreciate  them  more ,COMMA and  create  the  kinds  of  connections  that  can  stop  some  of  the  challenges  that  we  face  in  our  society  today .PERIOD they  're  only  going  to  get  magnified  by  the  very  technology  that  's  connecting  us ,COMMA because  it  's  making  us  intersect .PERIOD and  that  intersection  does  n't  always  create  the  view  of  everybody  now  understands  everybody ,COMMA and  everybody  appreciates  everybody  so ,COMMA i've  had  an  obsession  basically  for  30  years ,COMMA and  that  obsession  has  been ,COMMA what  makes  the  difference  in  the  quality  of  peoples  lives ?QUESTIONMARK what  makes  the  difference  in  their  performance  because  that  's  what  i  got  hired  to  do .PERIOD i've  got  to  produce  the  result  now .PERIOD that  's  what  i've  done  for  30  years .PERIOD i  get  the  phone  call  when  the  athlete  is  burning  down  on  national  television ,COMMA and  they  were  ahead  by  five  strokes  and  now  they  cannot  get  back  on  the  course .PERIOD and  i've  got  to  do  something  right  now  to  get  the  result  or  nothing  matters .PERIOD i  get  the  phone  call  when  the  child  is  going  commit  suicide ,COMMA and  i've  got  to  do  something  right  now .PERIOD and  in  29  years ,COMMA i  'm  very  grateful  to  tell  you  i've  never  lost  one  in  29  years .PERIOD it  does  n't  mean  i  wo  n't  some  day .PERIOD but  i  have  n't  done  it ,COMMA and  the  reason  is  an  understanding  of  these  human  needs  that  i  want  to  talk  to  you  about .PERIOD so ,COMMA when  i  get  those  calls  about  performance ,COMMA that  's  one  thing .PERIOD how  do  you  make  a  change ?QUESTIONMARK but  also ,COMMA i  'm  looking  to  see  what  is  it  that  's  shaping  that  person  's  ability  to  contribute ,COMMA to  do  something  beyond  themselves .PERIOD so  maybe  the  real  question  is ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA i  look  at  life  and  say ,COMMA there  's  two  master  lessons .PERIOD one  is ,COMMA there  's  the  science  of  achievement ,COMMA which  almost  everything  that  's  run  is  mastered  to  an  amazing  extent .PERIOD that  's  how  do  you  take  the  invisible  and  make  it  visible ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK how  do  you  take  what  you  're  dreaming  of  and  make  it  happen ?QUESTIONMARK whether  it  be  your  business ,COMMA your  contribution  to  society ,COMMA money ,COMMA whatever  it  is  for  you ,COMMA your  body ,COMMA your  family .PERIOD but  the  other  lesson  of  life  that  is  rarely  mastered  is  the  art  of  fulfillment .PERIOD because  science  is  easy ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK we  know  the  rules .PERIOD you  write  the  code .PERIOD you  follow  the ,COMMA and  you  get  the  results .PERIOD once  you  know  the  game  you  just ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  up  the  ante ,COMMA do  n't  you ?QUESTIONMARK but  when  it  comes  to  fulfillment ,COMMA that  's  an  art .PERIOD and  the  reason  is ,COMMA it  's  about  appreciation  and  it  's  about  contribution .PERIOD you  can  only  feel  so  much  by  yourself .PERIOD so ,COMMA i've  had  an  interesting  laboratory  to  try  to  answer  the  question  of  the  real  question ,COMMA which  is  what  's  the  difference  in  somebody  's  life  if  you  look  at  somebody  like  those  people  that  you've  given  everything  to ?QUESTIONMARK like  all  the  resources  they  say  they  need .PERIOD you  gave  them  not  a  100-dollar  computer .PERIOD you  gave  them  the  best  computer .PERIOD you  gave  them  love .PERIOD you  gave  them  joy .PERIOD you  were  there  to  comfort  them .PERIOD and  those  people  very  often ,COMMA and  you  know  some  of  them ,COMMA i  'm  sure ,COMMA end  up  the  rest  of  their  life  with  all  this  love ,COMMA education ,COMMA money  and  background ,COMMA spending  their  life  going  in  and  out  of  rehab .PERIOD and  then  you  meet  people  that  have  been  through  ultimate  pain ,COMMA psychologically ,COMMA sexually ,COMMA spiritually ,COMMA emotionally  abused ,COMMA and  not  always ,COMMA but  often ,COMMA they  become  some  of  the  people  that  contribute  the  most  to  society .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  question  we've  got  to  ask  ourselves  really  is ,COMMA what  is  it ?QUESTIONMARK what  is  it  that  shapes  us ?QUESTIONMARK and  we  live  in  a  therapy  culture .PERIOD most  of  us  do  n't  do  that ,COMMA but  the  culture  's  a  therapy  culture .PERIOD and  what  i  mean  by  that  is  the  mindset  that  we  are  our  past .PERIOD and  everybody  in  this  room ,COMMA you  would  n't  be  in  this  room  if  you  bought  that  theory ,COMMA but  the ,COMMA most  of  society  thinks  biography  is  destiny .PERIOD the  past  equals  the  future .PERIOD and  of  course  it  does  if  you  live  there .PERIOD but  what  people  in  this  room  know ,COMMA and  what  we  have  to  remind  ourselves ,COMMA though ,COMMA because  you  can  know  something  intellectually ,COMMA you  can  know  what  to  do  and  then  not  use  it ,COMMA not  apply  it .PERIOD so  really ,COMMA we  're  going  to  remind  ourselves  that  decision  is  the  ultimate  power .PERIOD that  's  what  it  really  is .PERIOD now ,COMMA when  you  ask  people ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA have  you  failed  to  achieve  something ?QUESTIONMARK how  many  have  ever  failed  to  achieve  something  significant  in  your  life ?QUESTIONMARK say ,COMMA aye  audience ,COMMA aye .PERIOD tr ,COMMA thanks  for  the

 may  not  have  the  money .PERIOD you  may  not  have  the  supreme  court .PERIOD but  that  is  not  the  defining  factor .PERIOD and  you  correct  me  if  i  'm  wrong .PERIOD the  defining  factor  is  never  resources .PERIOD it  's  resourcefulness .PERIOD and  what  i  mean  specifically ,COMMA rather  than  just  some  phrase ,COMMA is  if  you  have  emotion ,COMMA human  emotion ,COMMA something  that  i  experienced  from  you  a  day  before  yesterday  at  a  level  that  is  as  profound  as  i've  ever  experienced ,COMMA and  if  you'd  communicated  with  that  emotion  i  believe  you  would  have  beat  his  ass  and  won .PERIOD but ,COMMA how  easy  for  me  to  tell  him  what  he  should  do .PERIOD idiot ,COMMA robbins .PERIOD but  i  know  when  we  watched  the  debate  at  that  time ,COMMA there  were  emotions  that  blocked  people  's  ability  to  get  this  man  's  intellect  and  capacity .PERIOD and  the  way  that  it  came  across  to  some  people  on  that  day ,COMMA because  i  know  people  that  wanted  to  vote  in  your  direction  and  did  n't ,COMMA and  i  was  upset .PERIOD but  there  was  emotion  that  was  there .PERIOD how  many  know  what  i  'm  talking  about  here ?QUESTIONMARK say ,COMMA aye .PERIOD audience ,COMMA aye .PERIOD tr ,COMMA so ,COMMA emotion  is  it .PERIOD and  if  we  get  the  right  emotion ,COMMA we  can  get  ourselves  to  do  anything .PERIOD we  can  get  through  it .PERIOD if  you  're  creative  enough ,COMMA playful  enough ,COMMA fun  enough ,COMMA can  you  get  through  to

way .PERIOD so  this  is  the  ultimate  resource .PERIOD but  this  is  not  the  story  that  people  tell  us ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK the  story  people  tell  us  is  a  bunch  of  different  stories .PERIOD they  tell  us  we  do  n't  have  the  resources ,COMMA but  ultimately ,COMMA if  you  take  a  look  here ,COMMA flip  it  up ,COMMA if  you  would ,COMMA they  say ,COMMA what  are

emotion .PERIOD is  this  the  end  or  the  beginning ?QUESTIONMARK is  god  punishing  me  or  rewarding  me ,COMMA or  is  this  the  roll  of  the  dice ?QUESTIONMARK an  emotion ,COMMA then ,COMMA creates  what  we  're  going  to  do  or  the  action .PERIOD so ,COMMA think  about  your  own  life .PERIOD the  decisions  that  have  shaped  your  destiny .PERIOD and  that  sounds  really  heavy ,COMMA but  in  the  last  five  or  10  years ,COMMA 15  years ,COMMA how  have  there  been  some  decisions  you've  made  that  if  you'd  made  a  different  decision ,COMMA your

no  belief  and  resources  or  resourcefulness ,COMMA is  violence .PERIOD if  i  put  a  gun  to  your  head  and  i  live  in  the  hood ,COMMA instantly  i  'm  significant .PERIOD zero  to  10

's  significant ,COMMA is  n't  it ?QUESTIONMARK so  you  want  to  risk  your  life  for  it .PERIOD so  that  's  why  violence  has  always  been  around  and  will  be  around  unless  we  have  a  consciousness  change  as  a  species .PERIOD now ,COMMA you  can  get  significance  a  million  ways ,COMMA but  to  be  significant ,COMMA you've  got  to  be  unique  and  different .PERIOD here

how  many  friends  you  have ,COMMA how  many  people  love  you ,COMMA you  feel  like  hell .PERIOD and  the  reason  we  grow ,COMMA i  believe ,COMMA is  so  we  have  something  to  give  of  value .PERIOD because  the  sixth  need  is  to  contribute  beyond  ourselves .PERIOD because  we  all  know ,COMMA corny  as  it  sounds ,COMMA the  secret  to  living  is  giving .PERIOD we  all

all  i  can  tell  you  is ,COMMA i  brought  this  man  on  stage  with  a  man  from  new  york  who  worked  in  the  world  trade  center ,COMMA because  i  had  about  200  new  yorkers  there .PERIOD more  than  50  lost  their  entire  companies ,COMMA their  friends ,COMMA marking  off  their  palm  pilots ,COMMA one  financial  trader ,COMMA this  woman  made  of  steel ,COMMA bawling

there  are  people ,COMMA then  one  woman  got  up  and  she  was  so  angry  and  screaming  and  yelling .PERIOD then  i  found  out  she  was  n't  from  new  york .PERIOD she  's  not  an  american .PERIOD she  does  n't  know  anybody  here .PERIOD i  said ,COMMA do  you  always  get  angry  she  said ,COMMA yes  guilty  people  got  guilty ,COMMA sad  people  got  sad .PERIOD and  i  took  these  two  men  and  did  what  i  call  an  indirect  negotiation .PERIOD jewish  man  with  family  in  the  occupied  territory ,COMMA someone  in  new  york  who  would  have  died  if  he

happy  to  send  you ,COMMA so  you  can  really  see  what  actually  happened  instead  of  my  verbalization  of  it .PERIOD but  the  two  of  them  not  only  came  together  and  changed  their

create  peace .PERIOD and  he  wrote  a  book ,COMMA which  is  called  my  jihad ,COMMA my  way  of  peace  so ,COMMA transformation  can  happen .PERIOD so  my  invitation  to  you  is  this ,COMMA explore  your  web ,COMMA the  web  in  here ,COMMA the  needs ,COMMA the  beliefs ,COMMA the  emotions  that  are  controlling  you .PERIOD for  two  reasons ,COMMA so  there  's  more  of  you  to  give ,COMMA and  achieve  too ,COMMA we  all  want  to  do  it ,COMMA but  i  mean  give ,COMMA because  that  's  what  's  going  to  fill  you  up .PERIOD and  secondly ,COMMA so  you  can  appreciate ,COMMA not  just  understand ,COMMA that  's  intellectual ,COMMA that  's  the  mind ,COMMA but  appreciate  what  's  driving  other  people .PERIOD it  's  the  only  way  our  world  's  going  to  change .PERIOD god  bless  you .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  hope  this  was  of  service .PERIOD how  do  you  observe  something  you  cannot  see ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  the  basic  question  of  somebody  who  's  interested  in  finding  and  studying  black  holes .PERIOD because  black  holes  are  objects  whose  pull  of  gravity  is  so  intense  that  nothing  can  escape  it ,COMMA not  even  light ,COMMA so  you  cannot  see  it  directly .PERIOD so ,COMMA my  story  today  about  black  holes  is  about  one  particular  black  hole .PERIOD i  'm  interested  in  finding  whether  or  not  there  is  a  really  massive ,COMMA what  we  like  to  call  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  our  galaxy .PERIOD and  the  reason  this  is  interesting  is  that  it  gives  us  an  opportunity  to  prove  whether  or  not  these  exotic  objects  really  exist .PERIOD and  second ,COMMA it  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  understand  how  these  supermassive  black  holes  interact  with  their  environment ,COMMA and  to  understand  how  they  affect  the  formation  and  evolution  of  the  galaxies  which  they  reside  in .PERIOD so ,COMMA to  begin  with ,COMMA we  need  to  understand  what  a  black  hole  is  so  we  can  understand  the  proof  of  a  black  hole .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  is  a  black  hole ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA in  many  ways  a  black  hole  is  an  incredibly  simple  object ,COMMA because  there  are  only  three  characteristics  that  you  can  describe ,COMMA the  mass ,COMMA the  spin ,COMMA and  the  charge .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  only  talk  about  the  mass .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  that  sense ,COMMA it  's  a  very  simple  object .PERIOD but  in  another  sense ,COMMA it  's  an  incredibly  complicated  object  that  we  need  relatively  exotic  physics  to  describe ,COMMA and  in  some  sense  represents  the  breakdown  of  our  physical  understanding  of  the  universe .PERIOD but  today ,COMMA the  way  i  want  you  to  understand  a  black  hole ,COMMA for  the  proof  of  a  black  hole ,COMMA is  to  think  of  it  as  an  object  whose  mass  is  confined  to  zero  volume .PERIOD so ,COMMA despite  the  fact  that  i  'm  going  to  talk  to  you  about  an  object  that  's  supermassive ,COMMA and  i  'm  going  to  get  to  what  that  really  means  in  a  moment ,COMMA it  has  no  finite  size .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  is  a  little  tricky .PERIOD but  fortunately  there  is  a  finite  size  that  you  can  see ,COMMA and  that  's  known  as  the  schwarzschild  radius .PERIOD and  that  's  named  after  the  guy  who  recognized  why  it  was  such  an  important  radius .PERIOD this  is  a  virtual  radius ,COMMA not  reality .PERIOD the  black  hole  has  no  size .PERIOD so  why  is  it  so  important ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  important  because  it  tells  us  that  any  object  can  become  a  black  hole .PERIOD that  means  you ,COMMA your  neighbor ,COMMA your  cellphone ,COMMA the  auditorium  can  become  a  black  hole  if  you  can  figure  out  how  to  compress  it  down  to  the  size  of  the  schwarzschild  radius .PERIOD at  that  point ,COMMA what  's  going  to  happen ?QUESTIONMARK at  that  point  gravity  wins .PERIOD gravity  wins  over  all  other  known  forces .PERIOD and  the  object  is  forced  to  continue  to  collapse  to  an  infinitely  small  object .PERIOD and  then  it  's  a  black  hole .PERIOD so ,COMMA if  i  were  to  compress  the  earth  down  to  the  size  of  a  sugar  cube ,COMMA it  would  become  a  black  hole ,COMMA because  the  size  of  a  sugar  cube  is  its  schwarzschild  radius .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  key  here  is  to  figure  out  what  that  schwarzschild  radius  is .PERIOD and  it  turns  out  that  it  's  actually  pretty  simple  to  figure  out .PERIOD it  depends  only  on  the  mass  of  the  object .PERIOD bigger  objects  have  bigger  schwarzschild  radii .PERIOD smaller  objects  have  smaller  schwarzschild  radii .PERIOD so ,COMMA if  i  were  to  take  the  sun  and  compress  it  down  to  the  scale  of  the  university  of  oxford ,COMMA it  would  become  a  black  hole .PERIOD so ,COMMA now  we  know  what  a  schwarzschild  radius  is .PERIOD and  it  's  actually  quite  a  useful  concept ,COMMA because  it  tells  us  not  only  when  a  black  hole  will  form ,COMMA but  it  also  gives  us  the  key  elements  for  the  proof  of  a  black  hole .PERIOD i  only  need  two  things .PERIOD i  need  to  understand  the  mass  of  the  object  i  'm  claiming  is  a  black  hole ,COMMA and  what  its  schwarzschild  radius  is .PERIOD and  since  the  mass  determines  the  schwarzschild  radius ,COMMA there  is  actually  only  one  thing  i  really  need  to  know .PERIOD so ,COMMA my  job  in  convincing  you  that  there  is  a  black  hole  is  to  show  that  there  is  some  object  that  's  confined  to  within  its  schwarzschild  radius .PERIOD and  your  job  today  is  to  be  skeptical .PERIOD okay ,COMMA so ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  talk  about  no  ordinary  black  hole .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  talk  about  supermassive  black  holes .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  wanted  to  say  a  few  words  about  what  an  ordinary  black  hole  is ,COMMA as  if  there  could  be  such  a  thing  as  an  ordinary  black  hole .PERIOD an  ordinary  black  hole  is  thought  to  be  the  end  state  of  a  really  massive  star  's  life .PERIOD so ,COMMA if  a  star  starts  its  life  off  with  much  more  mass  than  the  mass  of  the  sun ,COMMA it  's  going  to  end  its  life  by  exploding  and  leaving  behind  these  beautiful  supernova  remnants  that  we  see  here .PERIOD and  inside  that  supernova  remnant  is  going  to  be  a  little  black  hole  that  has  a  mass  roughly  three  times  the  mass  of  the  sun .PERIOD on  an  astronomical  scale  that  's  a  very  small  black  hole .PERIOD now ,COMMA what  i  want  to  talk  about  are  the  supermassive  black  holes .PERIOD and  the  supermassive  black  holes  are  thought  to  reside  at  the  center  of  galaxies .PERIOD and  this  beautiful  picture  taken  with  the  hubble  space  telescope  shows  you  that  galaxies  come  in  all  shapes  and  sizes .PERIOD there  are  big  ones .PERIOD there  are  little  ones .PERIOD almost  every  object  in  that  picture  there  is  a  galaxy .PERIOD and  there  is  a  very  nice  spiral  up  in  the  upper  left .PERIOD and  there  are  a  hundred  billion  stars  in  that  galaxy ,COMMA just  to  give  you  a  sense  of  scale .PERIOD and  all  the  light  that  we  see  from  a  typical  galaxy ,COMMA which  is  the  kind  of  galaxies  that  we  're  seeing  here ,COMMA comes  from  the  light  from  the  stars .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  see  the  galaxy  because  of  the  star  light .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  are  a  few  relatively  exotic  galaxies .PERIOD i  like  to  call  these  the  prima  donna  of  the  galaxy  world ,COMMA because  they  are  kind  of  show  offs .PERIOD and  we  call  them  active  galactic  nuclei .PERIOD and  we  call  them  that  because  their  nucleus ,COMMA or  their  center ,COMMA are  very  active .PERIOD so ,COMMA at  the  center  there ,COMMA that  's  actually  where  most  of  the  starlight  comes  out  from .PERIOD and  yet ,COMMA what  we  actually  see  is  light  that  cannot  be  explained  by  the  starlight .PERIOD it  's  way  more  energetic .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA in  a  few  examples  it  's  like  the  ones  that  we  're  seeing  here .PERIOD there  are  also  jets  emanating  out  from  the  center .PERIOD again ,COMMA a  source  of  energy  that  's  very  difficult  to  explain  if  you  just  think  that  galaxies  are  composed  of  stars .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  people  have  thought  is  that  perhaps  there  are  supermassive  black  holes  which  matter  is  falling  on  to .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  cannot  see  the  black  hole  itself ,COMMA but  you  can  convert  the  gravitational  energy  of  the  black  hole  into  the  light  we  see .PERIOD so ,COMMA there  is  the  thought  that  maybe  supermassive  black  holes  exist  at  the  center  of  galaxies .PERIOD but  it  's  a  kind  of  indirect  argument .PERIOD nonetheless ,COMMA it  's  given  rise  to  the  notion  that  maybe  it  's  not  just  these  prima  donnas  that  have  these  supermassive  black  holes ,COMMA but  rather  all  galaxies  might  harbor  these  supermassive  black  holes  at  their  centers .PERIOD and  if  that  's  the  case ,COMMA and  this  is  an  example  of  a  normal  galaxy .PERIOD what  we  see  is  the  star  light .PERIOD and  if  there  is  a  supermassive  black  hole ,COMMA what  we  need  to  assume  is  that  it  's  a  black  hole  on  a  diet .PERIOD because  that  is  the  way  to  suppress  the  energetic  phenomena  that  we  see  in  active  galactic  nuclei .PERIOD if  we  're  going  to  look  for  these  stealth  black  holes  at  the  center  of  galaxies ,COMMA the  best  place  to  look  is  in  our  own  galaxy ,COMMA our  milky  way .PERIOD and  this  is  a  wide  field  picture  taken  of  the  center  of  the  milky  way .PERIOD and  what  we  see  is  a  line  of  stars .PERIOD and  that  is  because  we  live  in  a  galaxy  which  has  a  flattened ,COMMA disk-like  structure .PERIOD and  we  live  in  the  middle  of  it ,COMMA so  when  we  look  towards  the  center ,COMMA we  see  this  plane  which  defines  the  plane  of  the  galaxy ,COMMA or  line  that  defines  the  plane  of  the  galaxy .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  advantage  of  studying  our  own  galaxy  is  it  's  simply  the  closest  example  of  the  center  of  a  galaxy  is  100  times  further  away .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  can  see  far  more  detail  in  our  galaxy  than  anyplace  else .PERIOD and  as  you  'll  see  in  a  moment ,COMMA the  ability  to  see  detail  is  key  to  this  experiment .PERIOD so ,COMMA how  do  astronomers  prove  that  there  is  a  lot  of  mass  inside  a  small  volume ?QUESTIONMARK which  is  the  job  that  i  have  to  show  you  today .PERIOD and  the  tool  that  we  use  is  to  watch  the  way  stars  orbit  the  black  hole .PERIOD stars  will  orbit  the  black  hole  in  the  very  same  way  that  planets  orbit  the  sun .PERIOD it  's  the  gravitational  pull  that  makes  these  things  orbit .PERIOD if  there  were  no  massive  objects  these  things  would  go  flying  off ,COMMA or  at  least  go  at  a  much  slower  rate  because  all  that  determines  how  they  go  around  is  how  much  mass  is  inside  its  orbit .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  is  great ,COMMA because  remember  my  job  is  to  show  there  is  a  lot  of  mass  inside  a  small  volume .PERIOD so ,COMMA if  i  know  how  fast  it  goes  around ,COMMA i  know  the  mass .PERIOD and  if  i  know  the  scale  of  the  orbit  i  know  the  radius .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  want  to  see  the  stars  that  are  as  close  to  the  center  of  the  galaxy  as  possible .PERIOD because  i  want  to  show  there  is  a  mass  inside  as  small  a  region  as  possible .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  means  that  i  want  to  see  a  lot  of  detail .PERIOD and  that  's  the  reason  that  for  this  experiment  we've  used  the  world  's  largest  telescope .PERIOD this  is  the  keck  observatory .PERIOD it  hosts  two  telescopes  with  a  mirror  10  meters ,COMMA which  is  roughly  the  diameter  of  a  tennis  court .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  is  wonderful ,COMMA because  the  campaign  promise  of  large  telescopes  is  that  is  that  the  bigger  the  telescope ,COMMA the  smaller  the  detail  that  we  can  see .PERIOD but  it  turns  out  these  telescopes ,COMMA or  any  telescope  on  the  ground  has  had  a  little  bit  of  a  challenge  living  up  to  this  campaign  promise .PERIOD and  that  is  because  of  the  atmosphere .PERIOD atmosphere  is  great  for  us .PERIOD it  allows  us  to  survive  here  on  earth .PERIOD but  it  's  relatively  challenging  for  astronomers  who  want  to  look  through  the  atmosphere  to  astronomical  sources .PERIOD so ,COMMA to  give  you  a  sense  of  what  this  is  like ,COMMA it  's  actually  like  looking  at  a  pebble  at  the  bottom  of  a  stream .PERIOD looking  at  the  pebble  on  the  bottom  of  the  stream ,COMMA the  stream  is  continuously  moving  and  turbulent ,COMMA very  much  in  the  same  way ,COMMA it  's  very  difficult  to  see  astronomical  sources ,COMMA because  of  the  atmosphere  that  's  continuously  moving  by .PERIOD so ,COMMA i've  spent  a  lot  of  my  career  working  on  ways  to  correct  for  the  atmosphere ,COMMA to  give  us  a  cleaner  view .PERIOD and  that  buys  us  about  a  factor  of  20 .PERIOD and  i  think  all  of  you  can  agree  that  if  you  can  figure  out  how  to  improve  life  by  a  factor  of  20 ,COMMA you've  probably  improved  your  lifestyle  by  a  lot ,COMMA say  your  salary ,COMMA you'd  notice ,COMMA or  your  kids ,COMMA you'd  notice .PERIOD and  this  animation  here  shows  you  one  example  of  the  techniques  that  we  use ,COMMA called  adaptive  optics .PERIOD you  're  seeing  an  animation  that  goes  between  an  example  of  what  you  would  see  if  you  do  n't  use  this  technique  -- .PERIOD in  other  words ,COMMA just  a  picture  that  shows  the  stars ,COMMA and  the  box  is  centered  on  the  center  of  the  galaxy ,COMMA where  we  think  the  black  hole  is .PERIOD so ,COMMA without  this  technology  you  cannot  see  the  stars .PERIOD with  this  technology  all  of  a  sudden  you  can  see  it .PERIOD this  technology  works  by  introducing  a  mirror  into  the  telescope  optics  system  that  's  continuously  changing  to  counteract  what  the  atmosphere  is  doing  to  you .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  's  kind  of  like  very  fancy  eyeglasses  for  your  telescope .PERIOD now ,COMMA in  the  next  few  slides  i  'm  just  going  to  focus  on  that  little  square  there .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  're  only  going  to  look  at  the  stars  inside  that  small  square ,COMMA although  we've  looked  at  all  of  them .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  want  to  see  how  these  things  have  moved .PERIOD and  over  the  course  of  this  experiment ,COMMA these  stars  have  moved  a  tremendous  amount .PERIOD so ,COMMA we've  been  doing  this  experiment  for  15  years ,COMMA and  we  see  the  stars  go  all  the  way  around .PERIOD now ,COMMA most  astronomers  have  a  favorite  star ,COMMA and  mine  today  is  a  star  that  's  labeled  up  there ,COMMA so-2 .PERIOD absolutely  my  favorite  star  in  the  world .PERIOD and  that  's  because  it  goes  around  in  only  15  years .PERIOD and  to  give  you  a  sense  of  how  short  that  is ,COMMA the  sun  takes  200  million  years  to  go  around  the  center  of  the  galaxy .PERIOD stars  that  we  knew  about  before ,COMMA that  were  as  close  to  the  center  of  the  galaxy  as  possible ,COMMA take  500  years .PERIOD and  this  one ,COMMA this  one  goes  around  in  a  human  lifetime .PERIOD that  's  kind  of  profound ,COMMA in  a  way .PERIOD but  it  's  the  key  to  this  experiment .PERIOD the  orbit  tells  me  how  much  mass  is  inside  a  very  small  radius .PERIOD so ,COMMA next  we  see  a  picture  here  that  shows  you  before  this  experiment  the  size  to  which  we  could  confine  the  mass  of  the  center  of  the  galaxy .PERIOD what  we  knew  before  is  that  there  was  four  million  times  the  mass  of  the  sun  inside  that  circle .PERIOD and  as  you  can  see ,COMMA there  was  a  lot  of  other  stuff  inside  that  circle .PERIOD you  can  see  a  lot  of  stars .PERIOD so ,COMMA there  was  actually  lots  of  alternatives  to  the  idea  that  there  was  a  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  the  galaxy ,COMMA because  you  could  put  a  lot  of  stuff  in  there .PERIOD but  with  this  experiment ,COMMA we've  confined  that  same  mass  to  a  much  smaller  volume  that  's  10,000  times  smaller .PERIOD and  because  of  that ,COMMA we've  been  able  to  show  that  there  is  a  supermassive  black  hole  there .PERIOD to  give  you  a  sense  of  how  small  that  size  is ,COMMA that  's  the  size  of  our  solar  system .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  're  cramming  four  million  times  the  mass  of  the  sun  into  that  small  volume .PERIOD now ,COMMA truth  in  advertising .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK i  have  told  you  my  job  is  to  get  it  down  to  the  schwarzchild  radius .PERIOD and  the  truth  is ,COMMA i  'm  not  quite  there .PERIOD but  we  actually  have  no  alternative  today  to  explaining  this  concentration  of  mass .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA it  's  the  best  evidence  we  have  to  date  for  not  only  existence  of  a  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  our  own  galaxy ,COMMA but  any  in  our  universe .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  next ?QUESTIONMARK i  actually  think  this  is  about  as  good  as  we  're  going  to  do  with  today  's  technology .PERIOD so  let  's  move  on  with  the  problem .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  i  want  to  tell  you ,COMMA very  briefly ,COMMA is  a  few  examples  of  the  excitement  of  what  we  can  do  today  at  the  center  of  the  galaxy ,COMMA now  that  we  know  that  there  is ,COMMA or  at  least  we  believe ,COMMA that  there  is  a  supermassive  black  hole  there .PERIOD and  the  fun  phase  of  this  experiment  is ,COMMA while  we've  tested  some  of  our  ideas  about  the  consequences  of  a  supermassive  black  hole  being  at  the  center  of  our  galaxy ,COMMA almost  every  single  one  has  been  inconsistent  with  what  we  actually  see .PERIOD and  that  's  the  fun .PERIOD so ,COMMA let  me  give  you  the  two  examples .PERIOD you  can  ask ,COMMA what  do  you  expect  for  the  old  stars ,COMMA stars  that  have  been  around  the  center  of  the  galaxy  for  a  long  time ,COMMA they've  had  plenty  of  time  to  interact  with  the  black  hole .PERIOD what  you  expect  there  is  that  old  stars  should  be  very  clustered  around  the  black  hole .PERIOD you  should  see  a  lot  of  old  stars  next  to  that  black  hole .PERIOD likewise ,COMMA for  the  young  stars ,COMMA or  in  contrast ,COMMA the  young  stars ,COMMA they  just  should  not  be  there .PERIOD a  black  hole  does  not  make  a  kind  neighbor  to  a  stellar  nursery .PERIOD to  get  a  star  to  form ,COMMA you  need  a  big  ball  of  gas  and  dust  to  collapse .PERIOD and  it  's  a  very  fragile  entity .PERIOD and  what  does  the  big  black  hole  do ?QUESTIONMARK it  strips  that  gas  cloud  apart .PERIOD it  pulls  much  stronger  on  one  side  than  the  other  and  the  cloud  is  stripped  apart .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA we  anticipated  that  star  formation  should  n't  proceed  in  that  environment .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  should  n't  see  young  stars .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  do  we  see ?QUESTIONMARK using  observations  that  are  not  the  ones  i've  shown  you  today ,COMMA we  can  actually  figure  out  which  ones  are  old  and  which  ones  are  young .PERIOD the  old  ones  are  red .PERIOD the  young  ones  are  blue .PERIOD and  the  yellow  ones ,COMMA we  do  n't  know  yet .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  can  already  see  the  surprise .PERIOD there  is  a  dearth  of  old  stars .PERIOD there  is  an  abundance  of  young  stars ,COMMA so  it  's  the  exact  opposite  of  the  prediction .PERIOD so ,COMMA this  is  the  fun  part .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA today ,COMMA this  is  what  we  're  trying  to  figure  out ,COMMA this  mystery  of  how  do  you  get ,COMMA how  do  you  resolve  this  contradiction .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA my  graduate  students  are ,COMMA at  this  very  moment ,COMMA today ,COMMA at  the  telescope ,COMMA in  hawaii ,COMMA making  observations  to  get  us  hopefully  to  the  next  stage ,COMMA where  we  can  address  this  question  of  why  are  there  so  many  young  stars ,COMMA and  so  few  old  stars .PERIOD to  make  further  progress  we  really  need  to  look  at  the  orbits  of  stars  that  are  much  further  away .PERIOD to  do  that  we  'll  probably  need  much  more  sophisticated  technology  than  we  have  today .PERIOD because ,COMMA in  truth ,COMMA while  i  said  we  're  correcting  for  the  earth  's  atmosphere ,COMMA we  actually  only  correct  for  half  the  errors  that  are  introduced .PERIOD we  do  this  by  shooting  a  laser  up  into  the  atmosphere ,COMMA and  what  we  think  we  can  do  is  if  we  shine  a  few  more  that  we  can  correct  the  rest .PERIOD so  this  is  what  we  hope  to  do  in  the  next  few  years .PERIOD and  on  a  much  longer  time  scale ,COMMA what  we  hope  to  do  is  build  even  larger  telescopes ,COMMA because ,COMMA remember ,COMMA bigger  is  better  in  astronomy .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  want  to  build  a  30  meter  telescope .PERIOD and  with  this  telescope  we  should  be  able  to  see  stars  that  are  even  closer  to  the  center  of  the  galaxy .PERIOD and  we  hope  to  be  able  to  test  some  of  einstein  's  theories  of  general  relativity ,COMMA some  ideas  in  cosmology  about  how  galaxies  form .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  think  the  future  of  this  experiment  is  quite  exciting .PERIOD so ,COMMA in  conclusion ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  show  you  an  animation  that  basically  shows  you  how  these  orbits  have  been  moving ,COMMA in  three  dimensions .PERIOD and  i  hope ,COMMA if  nothing  else ,COMMA i've  convinced  you  that ,COMMA one ,COMMA we  do  in  fact  have  a  supermassive  black  hole  at  the  center  of  the  galaxy .PERIOD and  this  means  that  these  things  do  exist  in  our  universe ,COMMA and  we  have  to  contend  with  this ,COMMA we  have  to  explain  how  you  can  get  these  objects  in  our  physical  world .PERIOD second ,COMMA we've  been  able  to  look  at  that  interaction  of  how  supermassive  black  holes  interact ,COMMA and  understand ,COMMA maybe ,COMMA the  role  in  which  they  play  in  shaping  what  galaxies  are ,COMMA and  how  they  work .PERIOD none  of  this  would  have  happened  without  the  advent  of  the  tremendous  progress  that  's  been  made  on  the  technology  front .PERIOD and  we  think  that  this  is  a  field  that  is  moving  incredibly  fast ,COMMA and  holds  a  lot  in  store  for  the  future .PERIOD thanks  very  much .PERIOD /transcript .PERIOD i  'm  here  to  talk  about  the  wonder  and  the  mystery  of  conscious  minds .PERIOD the  wonder  is  about  the  fact  that  we  all  woke  up  this  morning  and  we  had  with  it  the  amazing  return  of  our  conscious  mind .PERIOD we  recovered  minds  with  a  complete  sense  of  self  and  a  complete  sense  of  our  own  existence ,COMMA yet  we  hardly  ever  pause  to  consider  this  wonder .PERIOD we  should ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA because  without  having  this  possibility  of  conscious  minds ,COMMA we  would  have  no  knowledge  whatsoever  about  our  humanity .PERIOD we  would  have  no  knowledge  whatsoever  about  the  world .PERIOD we  would  have  no  pains ,COMMA but  also  no  joys .PERIOD we  would  have  no  access  to  love  or  to  the  ability  to  create .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA scott  fitzgerald  said  famously  that  he  who  invented  consciousness  would  have  a  lot  to  be  blamed  for  but  he  also  forgot  that  without  consciousness ,COMMA he  would  have  no  access  to  true  happiness  and  even  the  possibility  of  transcendence .PERIOD so  much  for  the  wonder ,COMMA now  for  the  mystery .PERIOD this  is  a  mystery  that  has  really  been  extremely  hard  to  elucidate .PERIOD all  the  way  back  into  early  philosophy  and  certainly  throughout  the  history  of  neuroscience ,COMMA this  has  been  one  mystery  that  has  always  resisted  elucidation ,COMMA has  got  major  controversies .PERIOD and  there  are  actually  many  people  that  think  we  should  not  even  touch  it .PERIOD we  should  just  leave  it  alone ,COMMA it  's  not  to  be  solved .PERIOD i  do  n't  believe  that ,COMMA and  i  think  the  situation  is  changing .PERIOD it  would  be  ridiculous  to  claim  that  we  know  how  we  make  consciousness  in  our  brains ,COMMA but  we  certainly  can  begin  to  approach  the  question ,COMMA and  we  can  begin  to  see  the  shape  of  a  solution .PERIOD and  one  more  wonder  to  celebrate  is  the  fact  that  we  have  imaging  technologies  that  now  allow  us  to  go  inside  the  human  brain  and  be  able  to  do ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA what  you  're  seeing  right  now .PERIOD these  are  images  that  come  from  hanna  damasio  's  lab ,COMMA and  which  show  you ,COMMA in  a  living  brain ,COMMA the  reconstruction  of  that  brain .PERIOD and  this  is  a  person  who  is  alive .PERIOD this  is  not  a  person  that  is  being  studied  at  autopsy .PERIOD and  even  more ,COMMA and  this  is  something  that  one  can  be  really  amazed  about ,COMMA is  what  i  'm  going  to  show  you  next ,COMMA which  is  going  underneath  the  surface  of  the  brain  and  actually  looking  in  the  living  brain  at  real  connections ,COMMA real  pathways .PERIOD so  all  of  those  colored  lines  correspond  to  bunches  of  axons ,COMMA the  fibers  that  join  cell  bodies  to  synapses .PERIOD and  i  'm  sorry  to  disappoint  you ,COMMA they  do  n't  come  in  color .PERIOD but  at  any  rate ,COMMA they  are  there .PERIOD the  colors  are  codes  for  the  direction ,COMMA from  whether  it  is  back  to  front  or  vice  versa .PERIOD at  any  rate ,COMMA what  is  consciousness ?QUESTIONMARK what  is  a  conscious  mind ?QUESTIONMARK and  we  could  take  a  very  simple  view  and  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA it  is  that  which  we  lose  when  we  fall  into  deep  sleep  without  dreams ,COMMA or  when  we  go  under  anesthesia ,COMMA and  it  is  what  we  regain  when  we  recover  from  sleep  or  from  anesthesia .PERIOD but  what  is  exactly  that  stuff  that  we  lose  under  anesthesia ,COMMA or  when  we  are  in  deep ,COMMA dreamless  sleep ?QUESTIONMARK well  first  of  all ,COMMA it  is  a  mind ,COMMA which  is  a  flow  of  mental  images .PERIOD and  of  course  consider  images  that  can  be  sensory  patterns ,COMMA visual ,COMMA such  as  you  're  having  right  now  in  relation  to  the  stage  and  me ,COMMA or  auditory  images ,COMMA as  you  are  having  now  in  relation  to  my  words .PERIOD that  flow  of  mental  images  is  mind .PERIOD but  there  is  something  else  that  we  are  all  experiencing  in  this  room .PERIOD we  are  not  passive  exhibitors  of  visual  or  auditory  or  tactile  images .PERIOD we  have  selves .PERIOD we  have  a  me  that  is  automatically  present  in  our  minds  right  now .PERIOD we  own  our  minds .PERIOD and  we  have  a  sense  that  it  's  everyone  of  us  that  is  experiencing  this ,COMMA not  the  person  who  is  sitting  next  to  you .PERIOD so  in  order  to  have  a  conscious  mind ,COMMA you  have  a  self  within  the  conscious  mind .PERIOD so  a  conscious  mind  is  a  mind  with  a  self  in  it .PERIOD the  self  introduces  the  subjective  perspective  in  the  mind ,COMMA and  we  are  only  fully  conscious  when  self  comes  to  mind .PERIOD so  what  we  need  to  know  to  even  address  this  mystery  is ,COMMA number  one ,COMMA how  are  minds  are  put  together  in  the  brain ,COMMA and ,COMMA number  two ,COMMA how  selves  are  constructed .PERIOD now  the  first  part ,COMMA the  first  problem ,COMMA is  relatively  easy ,COMMA it  's  not  easy  at  all ,COMMA but  it  is  something  that  has  been  approached  gradually  in  neuroscience .PERIOD and  it  's  quite  clear  that ,COMMA in  order  to  make  minds ,COMMA we  need  to  construct  neural  maps .PERIOD so  imagine  a  grid ,COMMA like  the  one  i  'm  showing  you  right  now ,COMMA and  now  imagine ,COMMA within  that  grid ,COMMA that  two-dimensional  sheet ,COMMA imagine  neurons .PERIOD and  picture ,COMMA if  you  will ,COMMA a  billboard ,COMMA a  digital  billboard ,COMMA where  you  have  elements  that  can  be  either  lit  or  not .PERIOD and  depending  on  how  you  create  the  pattern  of  lighting  or  not  lighting ,COMMA the  digital  elements ,COMMA or ,COMMA for  that  matter ,COMMA the  neurons  in  the  sheet ,COMMA you  're  going  to  be  able  to  construct  a  map .PERIOD this ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA is  a  visual  map  that  i  'm  showing  you ,COMMA but  this  applies  to  any  kind  of  map ,COMMA auditory ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA in  relation  to  sound  frequencies ,COMMA or  to  the  maps  that  we  construct  with  our  skin  in  relation  to  an  object  that  we  palpate .PERIOD now  to  bring  home  the  point  of  how  close  it  is ,COMMA the  relationship  between  the  grid  of  neurons  and  the  topographical  arrangement  of  the  activity  of  the  neurons  and  our  mental  experience ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  tell  you  a  personal  story .PERIOD so  if  i  cover  my  left  eye ,COMMA i  'm  talking  about  me  personally ,COMMA not  all  of  you ,COMMA if  i  cover  my  left  eye ,COMMA i  look  at  the  grid ,COMMA pretty  much  like  the  one  i  'm  showing  you .PERIOD everything  is  nice  and  fine  and  perpendicular .PERIOD but  sometime  ago ,COMMA i  discovered  that  if  i  cover  my  left  eye ,COMMA instead  what  i  get  is  this .PERIOD i  look  at  the  grid  and  i  see  a  warping  at  the  edge  of  my  central-left  field .PERIOD very  odd ,COMMA i've  analyzed  this  for  a  while .PERIOD but  sometime  ago ,COMMA through  the  help  of  an  opthamologist  colleague  of  mine ,COMMA carmen  puliafito ,COMMA who  developed  a  laser  scanner  of  the  retina ,COMMA i  found  out  the  the  following .PERIOD if  i  scan  my  retina  through  the  horizontal  plane  that  you  see  there  in  the  little  corner ,COMMA what  i  get  is  the  following .PERIOD on  the  right  side ,COMMA my  retina  is  perfectly  symmetrical .PERIOD you  see  the  going  down  towards  the  fovea  where  the  optic  nerve  begins .PERIOD but  on  my  left  retina  there  is  a  bump ,COMMA which  is  marked  there  by  the  red  arrow .PERIOD and  it  corresponds  to  a  little  cyst  that  is  located  below .PERIOD and  that  is  exactly  what  causes  the  warping  of  my  visual  image .PERIOD so  just  think  of  this ,COMMA you  have  a  grid  of  neurons ,COMMA and  now  you  have  a  plane  mechanical  change  in  the  position  of  the  grid ,COMMA and  you  get  a  warping  of  your  mental  experience .PERIOD so  this  is  how  close  your  mental  experience  and  the  activity  of  the  neurons  in  the  retina ,COMMA which  is  a  part  of  the  brain  located  in  the  eyeball ,COMMA or ,COMMA for  that  matter ,COMMA a  sheet  of  visual  cortex .PERIOD so  from  the  retina  you  go  onto  visual  cortex .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA the  brain  adds  on  a  lot  of  information  to  what  is  going  on  in  the  signals  that  come  from  the  retina .PERIOD and  in  that  image  there ,COMMA you  see  a  variety  of  islands  of  what  i  call  image-making  regions  in  the  brain .PERIOD you  have  the  green  for  example ,COMMA that  corresponds  to  tactile  information ,COMMA or  the  blue  that  corresponds  to  auditory  information .PERIOD and  something  else  that  happens  is  that  those  image-making  regions  where  you  have  the  plotting  of  all  these  neural  maps ,COMMA can  then  provide  signals  to  this  ocean  of  purple  that  you  see  around ,COMMA which  is  the  association  cortex .PERIOD where  you  can  make  records  of  what  went  on  in  those  islands  of  image-making .PERIOD and  the  great  beauty  is  that  you  can  then  go  from  memory ,COMMA out  of  those  association  cortices ,COMMA and  produce  back  images  in  the  very  same  regions  that  have  perception .PERIOD so  think  about  how  wonderfully  convenient  and  lazy  the  brain  is .PERIOD so  it  provides  certain  areas  for  perception  and  image-making .PERIOD and  those  are  exactly  the  same  that  are  going  to  be  used  for  image-making  when  we  recall  information .PERIOD so  far  the  mystery  of  the  conscious  mind  is  diminishing  a  little  bit  because  we  have  a  general  sense  of  how  we  make  these  images .PERIOD but  what  about  the  self ?QUESTIONMARK the  self  is  really  the  elusive  problem .PERIOD and  for  a  long  time ,COMMA people  did  not  even  want  to  touch  it ,COMMA because  they'd  say ,COMMA how  can  you  have  this  reference  point ,COMMA this  stability ,COMMA that  is  required  to  maintain  the  continuity  of  selves  day  after  day  and  i  thought  about  a  solution  to  this  problem .PERIOD it  's  the  following .PERIOD we  generate  brain  maps  of  the  body  's  interior  and  use  them  as  the  reference  for  all  other  maps .PERIOD so  let  me  tell  you  just  a  little  bit  about  how  i  came  to  this .PERIOD i  came  to  this  because ,COMMA if  you  're  going  to  have  a  reference  that  we  know  as  self ,COMMA the  me ,COMMA the  i  in  our  own  processing ,COMMA we  need  to  have  something  that  is  stable ,COMMA something  that  does  not  deviate  much  from  day  to  day .PERIOD well  it  so  happens  that  we  have  a  singular  body .PERIOD we  have  one  body ,COMMA not  two ,COMMA not  three .PERIOD and  so  that  is  a  beginning .PERIOD there  is  just  one  reference  point ,COMMA which  is  the  body .PERIOD but  then ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA the  body  has  many  parts ,COMMA and  things  grow  at  different  rates ,COMMA and  they  have  different  sizes  and  different  people .PERIOD however ,COMMA not  so  with  the  interior .PERIOD the  things  that  have  to  do  with  what  is  known  as  our  internal  milieu ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA the  whole  management  of  the  chemistries  within  our  body  are ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA extremely  maintained  day  after  day  for  one  very  good  reason .PERIOD if  you  deviate  too  much  in  the  parameters  that  are  close  to  the  midline  of  that  life-permitting  survival  range ,COMMA you  go  into  disease  or  death .PERIOD so  we  have  an  in-built  system  within  our  own  lives  that  ensures  some  kind  of  continuity .PERIOD i  like  to  call  it  an  almost  infinite  sameness  from  day  to  day .PERIOD because  if  you  do  n't  have  that  sameness ,COMMA physiologically ,COMMA you  're  going  to  be  sick  or  you  're  going  to  die .PERIOD so  that  's  one  more  element  for  this  continuity .PERIOD and  the  final  thing  is  that  there  is  a  very  tight  coupling  between  the  regulation  of  our  body  within  the  brain  and  the  body  itself ,COMMA unlike  any  other  coupling .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA i  'm  making  images  of  you ,COMMA but  there  's  no  physiological  bond  between  the  images  i  have  of  you  as  an  audience  and  my  brain .PERIOD however ,COMMA there  is  a  close ,COMMA permanently  maintained  bond  between  the  body  regulating  parts  of  my  brain  and  my  own  body .PERIOD so  here  's  how  it  looks .PERIOD look  at  the  region  there .PERIOD there  is  the  brain  stem  in  between  the  cerebral  cortex  and  the  spinal  cord .PERIOD and  it  is  within  that  region  that  i  'm  going  to  highlight  now  that  we  have  this  housing  of  all  the  life-regulation  devices  of  the  body .PERIOD this  is  so  specific  that ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA if  you  look  at  the  part  that  is  covered  in  red  in  the  upper  part  of  the  brain  stem ,COMMA if  you  damage  that  as  a  result  of  a  stroke ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA what  you  get  is  coma  or  vegetative  state ,COMMA which  is  a  state ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA in  which  your  mind  disappears ,COMMA your  consciousness  disappears .PERIOD what  happens  then  actually  is  that  you  lose  the  grounding  of  the  self ,COMMA you  have  no  longer  access  to  any  feeling  of  your  own  existence ,COMMA and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA there  can  be  images  going  on ,COMMA being  formed  in  the  cerebral  cortex ,COMMA except  you  do  n't  know  they  're  there .PERIOD you  have ,COMMA in  effect ,COMMA lost  consciousness  when  you  have  damage  to  that  red  section  of  the  brain  stem .PERIOD but  if  you  consider  the  green  part  of  the  brain  stem ,COMMA nothing  like  that  happens .PERIOD it  is  that  specific .PERIOD so  in  that  green  component  of  the  brain  stem ,COMMA if  you  damage  it ,COMMA and  often  it  happens ,COMMA what  you  get  is  complete  paralysis ,COMMA but  your  conscious  mind  is  maintained .PERIOD you  feel ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  have  a  fully  conscious  mind  that  you  can  report  very  indirectly .PERIOD this  is  a  horrific  condition .PERIOD you  do  n't  want  to  see  it .PERIOD and  people  are ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA imprisoned  within  their  own  bodies ,COMMA but  they  do  have  a  mind .PERIOD there  was  a  very  interesting  film ,COMMA one  of  the  rare  good  films  done  about  a  situation  like  this ,COMMA by  julian  schnabel  some  years  ago  about  a  patient  that  was  in  that  condition .PERIOD so  now  i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  picture .PERIOD i  promise  not  to  say  anything  about  this ,COMMA except  this  is  to  frighten  you .PERIOD it  's  just  to  tell  you  that  in  that  red  section  of  the  brain  stem ,COMMA there  are ,COMMA to  make  it  simple ,COMMA all  those  little  squares  that  correspond  to  modules  that  actually  make  brain  maps  of  different  aspects  of  our  interior ,COMMA different  aspects  of  our  body .PERIOD they  are  exquisitely  topographic  and  they  are  exquisitely  interconnected  in  a  recursive  pattern .PERIOD and  it  is  out  of  this  and  out  of  this  tight  coupling  between  the  brain  stem  and  the  body  that  i  believe ,COMMA and  i  could  be  wrong ,COMMA but  i  do  n't  think  i  am ,COMMA that  you  generate  this  mapping  of  the  body  that  provides  the  grounding  for  the  self  and  that  comes  in  the  form  of  feelings ,COMMA primordial  feelings ,COMMA by  the  way .PERIOD so  what  is  the  picture  that  we  get  here ?QUESTIONMARK look  at  cerebral  cortex ,COMMA look  at  brain  stem ,COMMA look  at  body ,COMMA and  you  get  the  picture  of  the  interconnectivity  in  which  you  have  the  brain  stem  providing  the  grounding  for  the  self  in  a  very  tight  interconnection  with  the  body .PERIOD and  you  have  the  cerebral  cortex  providing  the  great  spectacle  of  our  minds  with  the  profusion  of  images  that  are ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA the  contents  of  our  minds  and  that  we  normally  pay  most  attention  to ,COMMA as  we  should ,COMMA because  that  's  really  the  film  that  is  rolling  in  our  minds .PERIOD but  look  at  the  arrows .PERIOD they  're  not  there  for  looks .PERIOD they  're  there  because  there  's  this  very  close  interaction .PERIOD you  cannot  have  a  conscious  mind  if  you  do  n't  have  the  interaction  between  cerebral  cortex  and  brain  stem .PERIOD you  cannot  have  a  conscious  mind  if  you  do  n't  have  the  interaction  between  the  brain  stem  and  the  body .PERIOD another  thing  that  is  interesting  is  that  the  brain  stem  that  we  have  is  shared  with  a  variety  of  other  species .PERIOD so  throughout  vertebrates ,COMMA the  design  of  the  brain  stem  is  very  similar  to  ours ,COMMA which  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  i  think  those  other  species  have  conscious  minds  like  we  do .PERIOD except  that  they  're  not  as  rich  as  ours ,COMMA because  they  do  n't  have  a  cerebral  cortex  like  we  do .PERIOD that  's  where  the  difference  is .PERIOD and  i  strongly  disagree  with  the  idea  that  consciousness  should  be  considered  as  the  great  product  of  the  cerebral  cortex .PERIOD only  the  wealth  of  our  minds  is ,COMMA not  the  very  fact  that  we  have  a  self  that  we  can  refer  to  our  own  existence ,COMMA and  that  we  have  any  sense  of  person .PERIOD now  there  are  three  levels  of  self  to  consider ,COMMA the  proto ,COMMA the  core  and  the  autobiographical .PERIOD the  first  two  are  shared  with  many ,COMMA many  other  species ,COMMA and  they  are  really  coming  out  largely  of  the  brain  stem  and  whatever  there  is  of  cortex  in  those  species .PERIOD it  's  the  autobiographical  self  which  some  species  have ,COMMA i  think .PERIOD cetaceans  and  primates  have  also  an  autobiographical  self  to  a  certain  degree .PERIOD and  everybody  's  dogs  at  home  have  an  autobiographical  self  to  a  certain  degree .PERIOD but  the  novelty  is  here .PERIOD the  autobiographical  self  is  built  on  the  basis  of  past  memories  and  memories  of  the  plans  that  we  have  made .PERIOD it  's  the  lived  past  and  the  anticipated  future .PERIOD and  the  autobiographical  self  has  prompted  extended  memory ,COMMA reasoning ,COMMA imagination ,COMMA creativity  and  language .PERIOD and  out  of  that  came  the  instruments  of  culture ,COMMA religions ,COMMA justice ,COMMA trade ,COMMA the  arts ,COMMA science ,COMMA technology .PERIOD and  it  is  within  that  culture  that  we  really  can  get ,COMMA and  this  is  the  novelty ,COMMA something  that  is  not  entirely  set  by  our  biology .PERIOD it  is  developed  in  the  cultures .PERIOD it  developed  in  collectives  of  human  beings .PERIOD and  this  is ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA the  culture  where  we  have  developed  something  that  i  like  to  call  socio-cultural  regulation .PERIOD and  finally ,COMMA you  could  rightly  ask ,COMMA why  care  about  this ?QUESTIONMARK why  care  if  it  is  the  brain  stem  or  the  cerebral  cortex  and  how  this  is  made ?QUESTIONMARK three  reasons .PERIOD first ,COMMA curiosity .PERIOD primates  are  extremely  curious ,COMMA and  humans  most  of  all .PERIOD and  if  we  are  interested ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA in  the  fact  that  anti-gravity  is  pulling  galaxies  away  from  the  earth ,COMMA why  should  we  not  be  interested  in  what  is  going  on  inside  of  human  beings ?QUESTIONMARK second ,COMMA understanding  society  and  culture .PERIOD we  should  look  at  how  society  and  culture  in  this  socio-cultural  regulation  are  a  work  in  progress .PERIOD and  finally ,COMMA medicine .PERIOD let  's  not  forget  that  some  of  the  worst  diseases  of  humankind  are  diseases  such  as  depression ,COMMA alzheimer  's  disease ,COMMA drug  addiction .PERIOD think  of  strokes  that  can  devastate  your  mind  or  render  you  unconscious .PERIOD you  have  no  prayer  of  treating  those  diseases  effectively  and  in  a  non-serendipitous  way  if  you  do  not  know  how  this  works .PERIOD so  that  's  a  very  good  reason  beyond  curiosity  to  justify  what  we  're  doing ,COMMA and  to  justify  having  some  interest  in  what  is  going  on  in  our  brains .PERIOD thank  you  for  your  attention .PERIOD do  you  remember  the  story  of  odysseus  and  the  sirens  from  high  school  or  junior  high  school ?QUESTIONMARK there  was  this  hero ,COMMA odysseus ,COMMA who  's  heading  back  home  after  the  trojan  war .PERIOD and  he  's  standing  on  the  deck  of  his  ship ,COMMA he  's  talking  to  his  first  mate ,COMMA and  he  's  saying ,COMMA tomorrow ,COMMA we  will  sail  past  those  rocks ,COMMA and  on  those  rocks  sit  some  beautiful  women  called  sirens .PERIOD and  these  women  sing  an  enchanting  song ,COMMA a  song  so  alluring  that  all  sailors  who  hear  it  crash  into  the  rocks  and  die  now  you  would  expect ,COMMA given  that ,COMMA that  they  would  choose  an  alternate  route  around  the  sirens ,COMMA but  instead  odysseus  says ,COMMA i  want  to  hear  that  song .PERIOD and  so  what  i  'm  going  to  do  is  i  'm  going  to  pour  wax  in  the  ears  of  you  and  all  the  men ,COMMA stay  with  me ,COMMA so  that  you  cannot  hear  the  song ,COMMA and  then  i  'm  going  to  have  you  tie  me  to  the  mast  so  that  i  can  listen  and  we  can  all  sail  by  unaffected .PERIOD so  this  is  a  captain  putting  the  life  of  every  single  person  on  the  ship  at  risk  so  that  he  can  hear  a  song .PERIOD and  i'd  like  to  think  if  this  was  the  case ,COMMA they  probably  would  have  rehearsed  it  a  few  times .PERIOD odysseus  would  have  said ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let  's  do  a  dry  run .PERIOD you  tie  me  to  the  mast ,COMMA and  i  'm  going  to  beg  and  plead .PERIOD and  no  matter  what  i  say ,COMMA you  cannot  untie  me  from  the  mast .PERIOD all  right ,COMMA so  tie  me  to  the  mast  and  the  first  mate  takes  a  rope  and  ties  odysseus  to  the  mast  in  a  nice  knot .PERIOD and  odysseus  does  his  best  job  playacting  and  says ,COMMA untie  me .PERIOD untie  me .PERIOD i  want  to  hear  that  song .PERIOD untie  me  and  the  first  mate  wisely  resists  and  does  n't  untie  odysseus .PERIOD and  then  odysseus  says ,COMMA i  see  that  you  can  get  it .PERIOD all  right ,COMMA untie  me  now  and  we  'll  get  some  dinner  and  the  first  mate  hesitates .PERIOD he  's  like ,COMMA is  this  still  the  rehearsal ,COMMA or  should  i  untie  him  and  the  first  mate  thinks ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  guess  at  some  point  the  rehearsal  has  to  end .PERIOD so  he  unties  odysseus ,COMMA and  odysseus  flips  out .PERIOD he  's  like ,COMMA you  idiot .PERIOD you  moron .PERIOD if  you  do  that  tomorrow ,COMMA i  'll  be  dead ,COMMA you  'll  be  dead ,COMMA every  single  one  of  the  men  will  be  dead .PERIOD now  just  do  n't  untie  me  no  matter  what .PERIOD he  throws  the  first  mate  to  the  ground .PERIOD this  repeats  itself  through  the  night ,COMMA rehearsal ,COMMA tying  to  the  mast ,COMMA conning  his  way  out  of  it ,COMMA beating  the  poor  first  mate  up  mercilessly .PERIOD hilarity  ensues .PERIOD tying  yourself  to  a  mast  is  perhaps  the  oldest  written  example  of  what  psychologists  call  a  commitment  device .PERIOD a  commitment  device  is  a  decision  that  you  make  with  a  cool  head  to  bind  yourself  so  that  you  do  n't  do  something  regrettable  when  you  have  a  hot  head .PERIOD because  there  's  two  heads  inside  one  person  when  you  think  about  it .PERIOD scholars  have  long  invoked  this  metaphor  of  two  selves  when  it  comes  to  questions  of  temptation .PERIOD there  is  first ,COMMA the  present  self .PERIOD this  is  like  odysseus  when  he  's  hearing  the  song .PERIOD he  just  wants  to  get  to  the  front  row .PERIOD he  just  thinks  about  the  here  and  now  and  the  immediate  gratification .PERIOD but  then  there  's  this  other  self ,COMMA the  future  self .PERIOD this  is  odysseus  as  an  old  man  who  wants  nothing  more  than  to  retire  in  a  sunny  villa  with  his  wife  penelope  outside  of  ithaca ,COMMA the  other  one .PERIOD so  why  do  we  need  commitment  devices ?QUESTIONMARK well  resisting  temptation  is  hard ,COMMA as  the  19th  century  english  economist  nassau  william  senior  said ,COMMA to  abstain  from  the  enjoyment  which  is  in  our  power ,COMMA or  to  seek  distant  rather  than  immediate  results ,COMMA are  among  the  most  painful  exertions  of  the  human  will  if  you  set  goals  for  yourself  and  you  're  like  a  lot  of  other  people ,COMMA you  probably  realize  it  's  not  that  your  goals  are  physically  impossible  that  's  keeping  you  from  achieving  them ,COMMA it  's  that  you  lack  the  self-discipline  to  stick  to  them .PERIOD it  's  physically  possible  to  lose  weight .PERIOD it  's  physically  possible  to  exercise  more .PERIOD but  resisting  temptation  is  hard .PERIOD the  other  reason  that  it  's  difficult  to  resist  temptation  is  because  it  's  an  unequal  battle  between  the  present  self  and  the  future  self .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA let  's  face  it ,COMMA the  present  self  is  present .PERIOD it  's  in  control .PERIOD it  's  in  power  right  now .PERIOD it  has  these  strong ,COMMA heroic  arms  that  can  lift  doughnuts  into  your  mouth .PERIOD and  the  future  self  is  not  even  around .PERIOD it  's  off  in  the  future .PERIOD it  's  weak .PERIOD it  does  n't  even  have  a  lawyer  present .PERIOD there  's  nobody  to  stick  up  for  the  future  self .PERIOD and  so  the  present  self  can  trounce  all  over  its  dreams .PERIOD so  there  's  this  battle  between  the  two  selves  that  's  being  fought ,COMMA and  we  need  commitment  devices  to  level  the  playing  field  between  the  two .PERIOD now  i  'm  a  big  fan  of  commitment  devices  actually .PERIOD tying  yourself  to  the  mast  is  the  oldest  one ,COMMA but  there  are  other  ones  such  as  locking  a  credit  card  away  with  a  key  or  not  bringing  junk  food  into  the  house  so  you  wo  n't  eat  it  or  unplugging  your  internet  connection  so  you  can  use  your  computer .PERIOD i  was  creating  commitment  devices  of  my  own  long  before  i  knew  what  they  were .PERIOD so  when  i  was  a  starving  post-doc  at  columbia  university ,COMMA i  was  deep  in  a  publish-or-perish  phase  of  my  career .PERIOD i  had  to  write  five  pages  a  day  towards  papers  or  i  would  have  to  give  up  five  dollars .PERIOD and  when  you  try  to  execute  these  commitment  devices ,COMMA you  realize  the  devil  is  really  in  the  details .PERIOD because  it  's  not  that  easy  to  get  rid  of  five  dollars .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA you  cannot  burn  it .PERIOD that  's  illegal .PERIOD and  i  thought ,COMMA well  i  could  give  it  to  a  charity  or  give  it  to  my  wife  or  something  like  that .PERIOD but  then  i  thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i  'm  sending  myself  mixed  messages .PERIOD because  not  writing  is  bad ,COMMA but  giving  to  charity  is  good .PERIOD so  then  i  would  kind  of  justify  not  writing  by  giving  a  gift .PERIOD and  then  i  kind  of  flipped  that  around  and  thought ,COMMA well  i  could  give  it  to  the  neo-nazis .PERIOD but  then  i  was  like ,COMMA that  's  more  bad  than  writing  is  good ,COMMA and  so  that  would  n't  work .PERIOD so  ultimately ,COMMA i  just  decided  i  would  leave  it  in  an  envelope  on  the  subway .PERIOD sometimes  a  good  person  would  find  it ,COMMA sometimes  a  bad  person  would  find  it .PERIOD on  average ,COMMA it  was  just  a  completely  pointless  exchange  of  money  that  i  would  regret .PERIOD such  it  is  with  commitment  devices .PERIOD but  despite  my  like  for  them ,COMMA there  's  two  nagging  concerns  that  i've  always  had  about  commitment  devices ,COMMA and  you  might  feel  this  if  you  use  them  yourself .PERIOD so  the  first  is ,COMMA when  you've  got  one  of  these  devices  going ,COMMA such  as  this  contract  to  write  everyday  or  pay ,COMMA it  's  just  a  constant  reminder  that  you  have  no  self-control .PERIOD you  're  just  telling  yourself ,COMMA without  you ,COMMA commitment  device ,COMMA i  am  nothing ,COMMA i  have  no  self-discipline  and  then  when  you  're  ever  in  a  situation  where  you  do  n't  have  a  commitment  device  in  place ,COMMA like ,COMMA oh  my  god ,COMMA that  person  's  offering  me  a  doughnut ,COMMA and  i  have  no  defense  mechanism, ,COMMA you  just  eat  it .PERIOD so  i  do  n't  like  the  way  that  they  take  the  power  away  from  you .PERIOD i  think  self-discipline  is  something ,COMMA it  's  like  a  muscle .PERIOD the  more  you  exercise  it ,COMMA the  stronger  it  gets .PERIOD the  other  problem  with  commitment  devices  is  that  you  can  always  weasel  your  way  out  of  them .PERIOD you  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA of  course  i  cannot  write  today ,COMMA because  i  'm  giving  a  tedtalk  and  i  have  five  media  interviews ,COMMA and  then  i  'm  going  to  a  cocktail  party  and  then  i  'll  be  drunk  after  that .PERIOD and  so  there  's  no  way  that  this  is  going  to  work  so  in  effect ,COMMA you  are  like  odysseus  and  the  first  mate  in  one  person .PERIOD you  're  putting  yourself ,COMMA you  're  binding  yourself ,COMMA and  you  're  weaseling  your  way  out  of  it ,COMMA and  then  you  're  beating  yourself  up  afterwards .PERIOD so  i've  been  working  for  about  a  decade  now  on  finding  other  ways  to  change  people  's  relationship  to  the  future  self  without  using  commitment  devices .PERIOD in  particular ,COMMA i  'm  interested  in  the  relationship  to  the  future  financial  self .PERIOD and  this  is  a  timely  issue .PERIOD i  'm  talking  about  the  topic  of  saving .PERIOD now  saving  is  a  classic  two  selves  problem .PERIOD the  present  self  does  not  want  to  save  at  all .PERIOD it  wants  to  consume .PERIOD whereas  the  future  self  wants  the  present  self  to  save .PERIOD so  this  is  a  timely  problem .PERIOD we  look  at  the  savings  rate  and  it  has  been  declining  since  the  1950s .PERIOD at  the  same  time ,COMMA the  retirement  risk  index ,COMMA the  chance  of  not  being  able  to  meet  your  needs  in  retirement ,COMMA has  been  increasing .PERIOD and  we  're  at  a  situation  now  where  for  every  three  baby  boomers ,COMMA the  mckinsey  global  institute  predicts  that  two  will  not  be  able  to  meet  their  pre-retirement  needs  while  they  're  in  retirement .PERIOD so  what  can  we  do  about  this ?QUESTIONMARK there  's  a  philosopher ,COMMA derek  parfit ,COMMA who  said  some  words  that  were  inspiring  to  my  coauthors  and  i .PERIOD he  said  that ,COMMA we  might  neglect  our  future  selves  because  of  some  failure  of  belief  or  imagination .PERIOD that  is  to  say ,COMMA we  somehow  might  not  believe  that  we  're  going  to  get  old ,COMMA or  we  might  not  be  able  to  imagine  that  we  're  going  to  get  old  some  day .PERIOD on  the  one  hand ,COMMA it  sounds  ridiculous .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA we  know  that  we  're  going  to  get  old .PERIOD but  are  n't  there  things  that  we  believe  and  do  n't  believe  at  the  same  time ?QUESTIONMARK so  my  coauthors  and  i  have  used  computers ,COMMA the  greatest  tool  of  our  time ,COMMA to  assist  people  's  imagination  and  help  them  imagine  what  it  might  be  like  to  go  into  the  future .PERIOD and  i  'll  show  you  some  of  these  tools  right  here .PERIOD the  first  is  called  the  distribution  builder .PERIOD it  shows  people  what  the  future  might  be  like  by  showing  them  a  hundred  equally  probable  outcomes  that  might  be  obtained  in  the  future .PERIOD each  outcome  is  shown  by  one  of  these  markers ,COMMA and  each  sits  on  a  row  that  represents  a  level  of  wealth  and  retirement .PERIOD being  up  at  the  top  means  that  you  're  enjoying  a  high  income  in  retirement .PERIOD being  down  at  the  bottom  means  that  you  're  struggling  to  make  ends  meet .PERIOD when  you  make  an  investment ,COMMA what  you  're  really  saying  is ,COMMA i  accept  that  any  one  of  these  100  things  could  happen  to  me  and  determine  my  wealth  now  you  can  try  to  move  your  outcomes  around .PERIOD you  can  try  to  manipulate  your  fate ,COMMA like  this  person  is  doing ,COMMA but  it  costs  you  something  to  do  it .PERIOD it  means  that  you  have  to  save  more  today .PERIOD once  you  find  an  investment  that  you  're  happy  with ,COMMA what  people  do  is  they  click  done  and  the  markers  begin  to  disappear ,COMMA slowly ,COMMA one  by  one .PERIOD it  simulates  what  it  is  like  to  invest  in  something  and  to  watch  that  investment  pan  out .PERIOD at  the  end ,COMMA there  will  only  be  one  marker  left  standing  and  it  will  determine  our  wealth  in  retirement .PERIOD yes ,COMMA this  person  retired  at  150  percent  of  their  working  income  in  retirement .PERIOD they  're  making  more  money  while  retired  than  they  were  making  while  they  were  working .PERIOD if  you  're  like  most  people ,COMMA just  seeing  that  gave  you  a  small  sense  of  elation  and  joy ,COMMA just  to  think  about  making  50  percent  more  money  in  retirement  than  before .PERIOD however ,COMMA had  you  ended  up  on  the  very  bottom ,COMMA it  might  have  given  you  a  slight  sense  of  dread  and/or  nausea  thinking  about  struggling  to  get  by  in  retirement .PERIOD by  using  this  tool  over  and  over  and  simulating  outcome  after  outcome ,COMMA people  can  understand  that  the  investments  and  savings  that  they  undertake  today  determine  their  well-being  in  the  future .PERIOD now  people  are  motivated  through  emotions ,COMMA but  different  people  find  different  things  motivating .PERIOD this  is  a  simulation  that  uses  graphics ,COMMA but  other  people  find  motivating  what  money  can  buy ,COMMA not  just  numbers .PERIOD so  here  i  made  a  distribution  builder  where  instead  of  showing  numerical  outcomes ,COMMA i  show  people  what  those  outcomes  will  get  you ,COMMA in  particular  apartments  that  you  can  afford  if  you  're  retiring  on  3,000 ,COMMA 2,500 ,COMMA 2,000  dollars  per  month  and  so  on .PERIOD as  you  move  down  the  ladder  of  apartments ,COMMA you  see  that  they  get  worse  and  worse .PERIOD some  of  them  look  like  places  i  lived  in  as  a  graduate  student .PERIOD and  as  you  get  to  the  very  bottom ,COMMA you  're  faced  with  the  unfortunate  reality  that  if  you  do  n't  save  anything  for  retirement ,COMMA you  wo  n't  be  able  to  afford  any  housing  at  all .PERIOD those  are  actual  pictures  of  actual  apartments  renting  for  that  amount  as  advertised  on  the  internet .PERIOD the  last  thing  i  'll  show  you ,COMMA the  last  behavioral  time  machine ,COMMA is  something  that  i  created  with  hal  hershfield ,COMMA who  was  introduced  to  me  by  my  coauthor  on  a  previous  project ,COMMA bill  sharpe .PERIOD and  what  it  is  is  an  exploration  into  virtual  reality .PERIOD so  what  we  do  is  we  take  pictures  of  people ,COMMA in  this  case ,COMMA college-age  people ,COMMA and  we  use  software  to  age  them  and  show  these  people  what  they  'll  look  like  when  they  're  60 ,COMMA 70 ,COMMA 80  years  old .PERIOD and  we  try  to  test  whether  actually  assisting  your  imagination  by  looking  at  the  face  of  your  future  self  can  change  you  investment  behavior .PERIOD so  this  is  one  of  our  experiments .PERIOD here  we  see  the  face  of  the  young  subject  on  the  left .PERIOD he  's  given  a  control  that  allows  him  to  adjust  his  savings  rate .PERIOD as  he  moves  his  savings  rate  down ,COMMA it  means  that  he  's  saving  zero  when  it  's  all  the  way  here  at  the  left .PERIOD you  can  see  his  current  annual  income ,COMMA this  is  the  percentage  of  his  paycheck  that  he  can  take  home  today ,COMMA is  quite  high ,COMMA 91  percent ,COMMA but  his  retirement  income  is  quite  low .PERIOD he  's  going  to  retire  on  44  percent  of  what  he  earned  while  he  was  working .PERIOD if  he  saves  the  maximum  legal  amount ,COMMA his  retirement  income  goes  up ,COMMA but  he  's  unhappy  because  now  he  has  less  money  on  the  left-hand  side  to  spend  today .PERIOD other  conditions  show  people  the  future  self .PERIOD and  from  the  future  self  's  point  of  view ,COMMA everything  is  in  reverse .PERIOD if  you  save  very  little ,COMMA the  future  self  is  unhappy  living  on  44  percent  of  the  income .PERIOD whereas  if  the  present  self  saves  a  lot ,COMMA the  future  self  is  delighted ,COMMA where  the  income  is  close  up  near  100  percent .PERIOD to  bring  this  to  a  wider  audience ,COMMA i've  been  working  with  hal  and  allianz  to  create  something  we  call  the  behavioral  time  machine ,COMMA in  which  you  not  only  get  to  see  yourself  in  the  future ,COMMA but  you  get  to  see  anticipated  emotional  reactions  to  different  levels  of  retirement  wealth .PERIOD so  for  instance ,COMMA here  is  somebody  using  the  tool .PERIOD and  just  watch  the  facial  expressions  as  they  move  the  slider .PERIOD the  younger  face  gets  happier  and  happier ,COMMA saving  nothing .PERIOD the  older  face  is  miserable .PERIOD and  slowly ,COMMA slowly  we  're  bringing  it  up  to  a  moderate  savings  rate .PERIOD and  then  it  's  a  high  savings  rate .PERIOD the  younger  face  is  getting  unhappy .PERIOD the  older  face  is  quite  pleased  with  the  decision .PERIOD we  're  going  to  see  if  this  has  an  effect  on  what  people  do .PERIOD and  what  's  nice  about  it  is  it  's  not  something  that  biasing  people  actually ,COMMA because  as  one  face  smiles ,COMMA the  other  face  frowns .PERIOD it  's  not  telling  you  which  way  to  put  the  slider ,COMMA it  's  just  reminding  you  that  you  are  connected  to  and  legally  tied  to  this  future  self .PERIOD your  decisions  today  are  going  to  determine  its  well-being .PERIOD and  that  's  something  that  's  easy  to  forget .PERIOD this  use  of  virtual  reality  is  not  just  good  for  making  people  look  older .PERIOD there  are  programs  you  can  get  to  see  how  people  might  look  if  they  smoke ,COMMA if  they  get  too  much  exposure  to  the  sun ,COMMA if  they  gain  weight  and  so  on .PERIOD and  what  's  good  is ,COMMA unlike  in  the  experiments  that  hal  and  myself  ran  with  russ  smith ,COMMA you  do  n't  have  to  program  these  by  yourself  in  order  to  see  the  virtual  reality .PERIOD there  are  applications  you  can  get  on  smartphones  for  just  a  few  dollars  that  do  the  same  thing .PERIOD this  is  actually  a  picture  of  hal ,COMMA my  coauthor .PERIOD you  might  recognize  him  from  the  previous  demos .PERIOD and  just  for  kicks  we  ran  his  picture  through  the  balding ,COMMA aging  and  weight  gain  software  to  see  how  he  would  look .PERIOD hal  is  here ,COMMA so  i  think  we  owe  it  to  him  as  well  as  yourself  to  disabuse  you  of  that  last  image .PERIOD and  i  'll  close  it  there .PERIOD on  behalf  of  hal  and  myself ,COMMA i  wish  all  the  best  to  your  present  and  future  selves .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD let  me  introduce  to  you  rezero .PERIOD this  little  fellow  was  developed  by  a  group  of  10  undergraduate  students  at  the  autonomous  systems  laboratory  at  eth-zurich .PERIOD our  robot  belongs  to  a  family  of  robots  called  ballbots .PERIOD instead  of  wheels ,COMMA a  ballbot  is  balancing  and  moving  on  one  single  ball .PERIOD the  main  characteristics  of  such  a  system  is  that  there  's  one  sole  contact  point  to  the  ground .PERIOD this  means  that  the  robot  is  inherently  unstable .PERIOD it  's  like  when  i  am  trying  to  stand  on  one  foot .PERIOD you  might  ask  yourself ,COMMA what  's  the  usefulness  of  a  robot  that  's  unstable ?QUESTIONMARK now  we  'll  explain  that  in  a  second .PERIOD let  me  first  explain  how  rezero  actually  keeps  his  balance .PERIOD rezero  keeps  his  balance  by  constantly  measuring  his  pitch  angle  with  a  sensor .PERIOD he  then  counteracts  and  avoids  toppling  over  by  turning  the  motors  appropriately .PERIOD this  happens  160  times  per  second ,COMMA and  if  anything  fails  in  this  process ,COMMA rezero  would  immediately  fall  to  the  ground .PERIOD now  to  move  and  to  balance ,COMMA rezero  needs  to  turn  the  ball .PERIOD the  ball  is  driven  by  three  special  wheels  that  allow  rezero  to  move  into  any  direction  and  also  move  around  his  own  axis  at  the  same  time .PERIOD due  to  his  instability ,COMMA rezero  is  always  in  motion .PERIOD now  here  's  the  trick .PERIOD it  's  indeed  exactly  this  instability  that  allows  a  robot  to  move  very  dynamically .PERIOD let  's  play  a  little .PERIOD you  may  have  wondered  what  happens  if  i  give  the  robot  a  little  push .PERIOD in  this  mode ,COMMA he  's  trying  to  maintain  his  position .PERIOD for  the  next  demo ,COMMA i'd  like  you  to  introduce  to  my  colleagues  michael ,COMMA on  the  computer ,COMMA and  thomas  who  's  helping  me  onstage .PERIOD in  the  next  mode ,COMMA rezero  is  passive ,COMMA and  we  can  move  him  around .PERIOD with  almost  no  force  i  can  control  his  position  and  his  velocity .PERIOD i  can  also  make  him  spin .PERIOD in  the  next  mode ,COMMA we  can  get  rezero  to  follow  a  person .PERIOD he  's  now  keeping  a  constant  distance  to  thomas .PERIOD this  works  with  a  laser  sensor  that  's  mounted  on  top  of  rezero .PERIOD with  the  same  method ,COMMA we  can  also  get  him  to  circle  a  person .PERIOD we  call  this  the  orbiting  mode .PERIOD all  right ,COMMA thank  you ,COMMA thomas .PERIOD now ,COMMA what  's  the  use  of  this  technology ?QUESTIONMARK for  now ,COMMA it  's  an  experiment ,COMMA but  let  me  show  you  some  possible  future  applications .PERIOD rezero  could  be  used  in  exhibitions  or  parks .PERIOD with  a  screen  it  could  inform  people  or  show  them  around  in  a  fun  and  entertaining  way .PERIOD in  a  hospital ,COMMA this  device  could  be  used  to  carry  around  medical  equipment .PERIOD due  to  the  ballbot  system ,COMMA it  has  a  very  small  footprint  and  it  's  also  easy  to  move  around .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA who  would  n't  like  to  take  a  ride  on  one  of  these .PERIOD and  these  are  more  practical  applications .PERIOD but  there  's  also  a  certain  beauty  within  this  technology .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  thought  in  getting  up  to  my  ted  wish  i  would  try  to  begin  by  putting  in  perspective  what  i  try  to  do  and  how  it  fits  with  what  they  try  to  do .PERIOD we  live  in  a  world  that  everyone  knows  is  interdependent ,COMMA but  insufficient  in  three  major  ways .PERIOD it  is ,COMMA first  of  all ,COMMA profoundly  unequal: .PERIOD half  the  world  's  people  still  living  on  less  than  two  dollars  a  day .PERIOD a  billion  people  with  no  access  to  clean  water .PERIOD two  and  a  half  billion  no  access  to  sanitation .PERIOD a  billion  going  to  bed  hungry  every  night .PERIOD one  in  four  deaths  every  year  from  aids ,COMMA tb ,COMMA malaria

inequality  growing .PERIOD in  the  united  states ,COMMA since  2001  we've  had  five  years  of  economic  growth ,COMMA five  years  of  productivity  growth  in  the  workplace ,COMMA but  median  wages  are  stagnant  and  the  percentage  of  working  families  dropping  below  the  poverty  line  is  up  by  four  percent .PERIOD the  percentage  of  working  families  without  health  care  up  by  four  percent .PERIOD so  this  interdependent  world  which  has  been  pretty  good  to  most  of  us ,COMMA which  is  why  we  're  all  here  in  northern  california  doing  what  we  do  for  a  living ,COMMA enjoying  this  evening ,COMMA is  profoundly  unequal .PERIOD it  is  also  unstable .PERIOD unstable  because  of  the  threats  of  terror ,COMMA weapons  of  mass  destruction ,COMMA the  spread  of  global  disease  and  a  sense  that  we  are  vulnerable  to  it  in  a  way  that  we  were  n't  not  so  many  years  ago .PERIOD and  perhaps  most  important  of  all ,COMMA it  is  unsustainable  because  of  climate  change ,COMMA resource  depletion  and  species  destruction .PERIOD when  i  think  about  the  world  i  would  like  to  leave  to  my  daughter  and  the  grandchildren  i  hope  to  have ,COMMA it  is  a  world  that  moves  away  from  unequal ,COMMA unstable ,COMMA unsustainable  interdependence  to  integrated  communities ,COMMA locally ,COMMA nationally  and  globally ,COMMA that  share  the  characteristics  of  all  successful  communities: .PERIOD a  broadly  shared ,COMMA accessible  set  of  opportunities ,COMMA a  shared  sense  of  responsibility  for  the  success  of  the  common  enterprise  and  a  genuine  sense  of  belonging .PERIOD all  easier  said  than  done .PERIOD when  the  terrorist  incidents  occurred  in  the  united  kingdom  a  couple  of  years  ago ,COMMA i  think  even  though  they  did  n't  claim  as  many  lives  as  we  lost  in  the  united  states  on  9/11 ,COMMA i  think  the  thing  that  troubled  the  british  most  was  that  the  perpetrators  were  not  invaders ,COMMA but  homegrown  citizens  whose  religious  and  political  identities  were  more  important  to  them  than  the  people  they  grew  up  with ,COMMA went  to  school  with ,COMMA worked  with ,COMMA shared  weekends  with ,COMMA shared  meals  with .PERIOD in  other  words ,COMMA they  thought  their  differences  were  more  important  than  their  common  humanity .PERIOD it  is  the  central  psychological  plague  of  humankind  in  the  21st  century .PERIOD into  this  mix ,COMMA people  like  us ,COMMA who  are  not  in  public  office ,COMMA have  more  power  to  do  good  than  at  any  time  in  history ,COMMA because  more  than  half  the  world  's  people  live  under  governments  they  voted  in  and  can  vote  out .PERIOD and  even  non-democratic  governments  are  more  sensitive  to  public  opinion .PERIOD because  primarily  of  the  power  of  the  internet ,COMMA people  of  modest  means  can  band  together  and  amass  vast  sums  of  money  that  can  change  the  world  for  some  public  good  if  they  all  agree .PERIOD when  the  tsunami  hit  south  asia ,COMMA the  united  states  contributed  12  billion  dollars .PERIOD 30  percent  of  our  households  gave .PERIOD half  of  them  gave  over  the  internet .PERIOD the  median  contribution  was  somewhere  around  57  dollars .PERIOD and  thirdly ,COMMA because  of  the  rise  of  non-governmental  organizations .PERIOD they ,COMMA businesses ,COMMA

that  in  what  we  were  able  to  do  with  aids  drugs .PERIOD and  i  want  to  say  that  the  head  of  our  aids  effort ,COMMA and  the  person  who  also  is  primarily  active  in  the  wish

.PERIOD if  you  bought  them  in  vast  bulks ,COMMA you  could  get  them  at  a  little  under  400  dollars .PERIOD the  first  country  we  went  to  work  in ,COMMA the  bahamas ,COMMA was  paying  3,500  dollars  for  these  drugs .PERIOD the  market  was  so  terribly  disorganized  that  they  were  buying  this  medicine  through  two  agents  who  were  gigging  them  sevenfold .PERIOD so  the  very  first  week  we  were  working ,COMMA we  got  the  price  down  to  500  dollars .PERIOD and  all  of  a  sudden ,COMMA they  could  save  seven  times  as  many  lives  for  the  same  amount  of  money .PERIOD then  we  went  to  work  with  the  manufacturers  of  aids  medicines ,COMMA one  of  whom  was  cited  in  the  film ,COMMA and  negotiated  a  whole  different  change  in  business  strategy .PERIOD because  even  at  500  dollars ,COMMA these  drugs  were  being  sold  on  a  high-margin ,COMMA low-volume ,COMMA uncertain-payment  basis .PERIOD so  we  worked  on  improving  the  productivity  of  the  operations  and  the  supply  chain ,COMMA and  went  to  a  low-margin ,COMMA high-volume ,COMMA absolutely  certain-payment  business .PERIOD i  joked  that  the  main  contribution  we  made  to  the  battle  against  aids  was  to  get  the  manufacturers  to  change  from  a  jewelry  store  to  a  grocery  store  strategy .PERIOD but  the  price  went  to  140  dollars  from  500 .PERIOD and  pretty  soon ,COMMA the  average  price  was  192  dollars .PERIOD now  we  can  get  it  for  about  100  dollars .PERIOD children  's  medicine  was  600  dollars ,COMMA because  nobody  could  afford  to  buy  any  of  it .PERIOD we  negotiated  it  down  to  190 .PERIOD then ,COMMA the  french  imposed  their  brilliantly  conceived  airline  tax  to  create  a  something  called  unitaid ,COMMA got  a  bunch  of  other  countries  to  help .PERIOD that  children  's  medicine  is  now  60  dollars  a  person  a  year .PERIOD the  only  thing  that  is  keeping  us  from  basically  saving  the  lives  of  everybody  who  needs  the  medicine  to  stay  alive  are  the  absence  of  systems  necessary  to  diagnose ,COMMA treat  and  care  for  people  and  deliver  this  medicine .PERIOD we  started  a  childhood  obesity  initiative  with  the  heart  association  in  america .PERIOD we  tried  to  do  the  same  thing  by  negotiating  industry-right  deals  with  the  soft  drink  and  the  snack  food  industry  to  cut  the  caloric  and  other  dangerous  content  of  food  going  to  our  children  in  the  schools .PERIOD we  just  reorganized  the  markets .PERIOD and  it  occurred  to  me  that  in  this  whole  non-governmental  world ,COMMA somebody  needs  to  be  thinking  about  organizing  public  goods  markets .PERIOD and  that  is  now  what  we  're  trying  to  do ,COMMA and  working  with  this  large  cities  group  to  fight  climate  change ,COMMA to  negotiate  huge ,COMMA big ,COMMA volume  deals  that  will  enable  cities  which  generate  75  percent  of  the  world  's  greenhouse  gases ,COMMA to  drastically  and  quickly  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  a  way  that  is  good  economics .PERIOD and  this  whole  discussion  as  if  it  's  some  sort  of  economic  burden ,COMMA is  a  mystery  to  me .PERIOD i  think  it  's  a  bird  's  nest  on  the  ground .PERIOD when  al  gore  won  his  well-deserved  oscar  for  the  inconvenient  truth  movie ,COMMA i  was  thrilled ,COMMA but  i  had  urged  him  to  make  a  second  movie  quickly .PERIOD for  those  of  you  who  saw  an  inconvenient  truth ,COMMA the  most  important  slide  in  the  gore  lecture  is  the  last  one ,COMMA which  shows  here  's  where  greenhouse  gases  are  going  if  we  do  n't  do  anything ,COMMA here  's  where  they  could  go .PERIOD and  then  there  are  six  different  categories  of  things  we  can  do  to  change  the  trajectory .PERIOD we  need  a  movie  on  those  six  categories .PERIOD and  all  of  you  need  to  have  it  embedded  in  your  brains  and  to  organize  yourselves  around  it .PERIOD so  we  're  trying  to  do  that .PERIOD so  organizing  these  markets  is  one  thing  we  try  to  do .PERIOD now  we  have  taken  on  a  second  thing ,COMMA and  this  gets  to  my  wish .PERIOD it  has  been  my  experience  in  working  in  developing  countries  that  while  the  headlines  may  all  be ,COMMA the  pessimistic  headlines  may  say ,COMMA well ,COMMA we  cannot  do  this ,COMMA that  or  the  other  thing  because  of  corruption ,COMMA i  think  incapacity  is  a  far  bigger  problem  in  poor  countries  than  corruption ,COMMA and  feeds  corruption .PERIOD we  now  have  the  money ,COMMA given  these  low  prices ,COMMA to  distribute  aids  drugs  all  over  the  world  to  people  we  cannot  presently  reach .PERIOD today  these  low  prices  are  available  in  the  25  countries  where  we  work ,COMMA and  in  a  total  of  62  countries .PERIOD and  about  550,000  people  are  getting  the  benefits  of  them .PERIOD but  the  money  is  there  to  reach  others .PERIOD the  systems  are  not  there  to  reach  the  people .PERIOD so  what  we  have  been  trying  to  do ,COMMA working  first  in  rwanda  and  then  in  malawi  and  other  places ,COMMA but  i  want  to  talk  about  rwanda  tonight ,COMMA is  to  develop  a  model  for  rural  health  care  in  a  very  poor  area  that  can  be  used  to  deal  with  aids ,COMMA tb ,COMMA malaria ,COMMA other  infectious  diseases ,COMMA maternal  and  child  health ,COMMA and  a  whole  range  of  health  issues  poor  people  are  grappling  with  in  the  developing  world ,COMMA that  can  first  be  scaled  for  the  whole  nation  of  rwanda ,COMMA and  then  will  be  a  model  that  could  literally .PERIOD be  implemented  in  any  other  poor  country  in  the  world .PERIOD and  the  test  is ,COMMA one ,COMMA will  it  do  the  job ?QUESTIONMARK will  it  provide  high  quality  care ?QUESTIONMARK and  two ,COMMA will  it  do  it  at  a  price  that  will  enable  the  country  to  sustain  a  health  care  system  without  foreign  donors  after  five  to  10  years ?QUESTIONMARK because  the  longer  i  deal  with  these  problems ,COMMA the  more  convinced  i  am  that  we  have  to ,COMMA whether  it  's  economics ,COMMA health ,COMMA education ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA we  have  to  build  systems .PERIOD and  the  absence  of  systems  that  function  break  the  connection  which  got  you  all  in  this  seat  tonight .PERIOD you  think  about  whatever  your  life  has  been ,COMMA however  many  obstacles  you  have  faced  in  your  life ,COMMA at  critical  junctures  you  always  knew  there  was  a  predictable  connection  between  the  effort  you  exerted  and  the  result  you  achieved .PERIOD in  a  world  with  no  systems ,COMMA with  chaos ,COMMA everything  becomes  a  guerilla  struggle ,COMMA and  this  predictability  is  not  there .PERIOD and  it  becomes  almost  impossible  to  save  lives ,COMMA educate  kids ,COMMA develop  economies ,COMMA whatever .PERIOD the  person ,COMMA in  my  view ,COMMA who  has  done  the  best  job  of  this  in  the  health  care  area ,COMMA of  building  a  system  in  a  very  poor  area ,COMMA is  dr.  paul  farmer ,COMMA who ,COMMA many  of  you  know ,COMMA has  worked  for  now  20  years  with  his  group ,COMMA partners  in  health ,COMMA primarily  in  haiti  where  he  started .PERIOD but  they've  also  worked  in  russia ,COMMA in  peru  and  other  places  around  the  world .PERIOD as  poor  as  haiti  is ,COMMA in  the  area  where  farmer  's  clinic  is  active ,COMMA and  they  serve  a  catchment  area  far  greater  than  the  medical  professionals  they  have  would  indicate  they  could  serve ,COMMA since  1988 ,COMMA they  have  not  lost  one  person  to  tuberculosis ,COMMA not  one .PERIOD and  they've  achieved  a  lot  of  other  amazing  health  results .PERIOD so  when  we  decided  to  work  in  rwanda  on  trying  to  dramatically  increase  the  income  of  the  country  and  fight  the  aids  problem ,COMMA we  wanted  to  build  a  healthcare  network ,COMMA because  it  had  been  totally  destroyed  during  the  genocide  in  1994 ,COMMA and  the  per  capita  income  was  still  under  a  dollar  a  day .PERIOD so  i  rang  up ,COMMA asked  paul  farmer  if  he  would  help .PERIOD because  it  seemed  to  me  if  we  could  prove  there  was  a  model  in  haiti  and  a  model  in  rwanda  that  we  could  then  take  all  over  the  country ,COMMA number  one ,COMMA it  would  be  a  wonderful  thing  for  a  country  that  has  suffered  as  much  as  any  on  earth  in  the  last  15  years ,COMMA and  number  two ,COMMA we  would  have  something  that  could  then  be  adapted  to  any  other  poor  country  anywhere  in  the  world .PERIOD and  so  we  have  set  about  doing  that .PERIOD now ,COMMA we  started  working  together  18  months  ago .PERIOD and  we  're  working  in  an  area  called  southern  kayonza ,COMMA which  is  one  of  the  poorest  areas  in  rwanda ,COMMA with  a  group  that  originally  includes  about  400,000  people .PERIOD we  're  essentially  implementing  what  paul  farmer  did  in  haiti ,COMMA he  develops  and  trains  paid  community  health  workers  who  are  able  to  identify  health  problems ,COMMA ensure  that  people  who  have  aids  or  tb  are  properly  diagnosed  and  take  their  medicine  regularly ,COMMA who  work  on  bringing  about  health  education ,COMMA clean  water  and  sanitation ,COMMA providing  nutritional  supplements  and  moving  people  up  the  chain  of  health  care  if  they  have  problems  of  the  severity  that  require  it .PERIOD the  procedures  that  make  this  work  have  been  perfected ,COMMA as  i  said ,COMMA by  paul  farmer  and  his  team  in  their  work  in  rural  haiti  over  the  last  20  years .PERIOD recently  we  did  an  evaluation  of  the  first  18  months  of  our  efforts  in  rwanda .PERIOD and  the  results  were  so  good  that  the  rwandan  government  has  now  agreed  to  adopt  the  model  for  the  entire  country ,COMMA and  has  strongly  supported  and  put  the  full  resources  of  the  government  behind  it .PERIOD i  'll  tell  you  a  little  bit  about  our  team  because  it  's  indicative  of  what  we  do .PERIOD we  have  about  500  people  around  the  world  working  in  our  aids  program ,COMMA some  of  them  for  nothing ,COMMA just  for  transportation ,COMMA room  and  board .PERIOD and  then  we  have  others  working  in  these  other  related  programs .PERIOD our  business  plan  in  rwanda  was  put  together  under  the  leadership  of  diana  noble ,COMMA who  is  an  unusually  gifted  woman ,COMMA but  not  unusual  in  the  type  of  people  who  have  been  willing  to  do  this  kind  of  work .PERIOD she  was  the  youngest  partner  at  schroder  ventures  in  london  in  her  20s .PERIOD she  was  ceo  of  a  successful  e-venture ,COMMA she  started  and  built  reed  elsevier  ventures ,COMMA and  at  45  she  decided  she  wanted  to  do  something  different  with  her  life .PERIOD so  she  now  works  full-time  on  this  for  very  little  pay .PERIOD she  and  her  team  of  former  business  people  have  created  a  business  plan  that  will  enable  us  to  scale  this  health  system  up  for  the  whole  country .PERIOD and  it  would  be  worthy  of  the  kind  of  private  equity  work  she  used  to  do  when  she  was  making  a  lot  more  money  for  it .PERIOD when  we  came  to  this  rural  area ,COMMA 45  percent  of  the  children  under  the  age  of  five  had  stunted  growth  due  to  malnutrition .PERIOD 23  percent  of  them  died  before  they  reached  the  age  of  five .PERIOD mortality  at  birth  was  over  two-and-a-half  percent .PERIOD over  15  percent  of  the  deaths  among  adults  and  children  occurred  because  of  intestinal  parasites  and  diarrhea  from  dirty  water  and  inadequate  sanitation ,COMMA all  entirely  preventable  and  treatable .PERIOD over  13  percent  of  the  deaths  were  from  respiratory  illnesses ,COMMA again ,COMMA all  preventable  and  treatable .PERIOD and  not  a  single  soul  in  this  area  was  being  treated  for  aids  or  tuberculosis .PERIOD within  the  first  18  months ,COMMA the  following  things  happened ,COMMA we  went  from  zero  to  about  2,000  people  being  treated  for  aids .PERIOD that  's  80  percent  of  the  people  who  need  treatment  in  this  area .PERIOD listen  to  this ,COMMA less  than  four-tenths  of  one  percent  of  those  being  treated  stopped  taking  their  medicine  or  otherwise  defaulted  on  treatment .PERIOD that  's  lower  than  the  figure  in  the  united  states .PERIOD less  than  three-tenths  of  one  percent  had  to  transfer  to  the  more  expensive  second-line  drugs .PERIOD 400,000  pregnant  women  were  brought  into  counseling  and  will  give  birth  for  the  first  time  within  an  organized  healthcare  system .PERIOD that  's  about  43  percent  of  all  the  pregnancies .PERIOD about  40  percent  of  all  the  people ,COMMA i  said  400,000 .PERIOD i  meant  40,000 .PERIOD about  40  percent  of  all  the  people  who  need  tb  treatment  are  now  getting  it ,COMMA in  just  18  months ,COMMA up  from  zero  when  we  started .PERIOD 43  percent  of  the  children  in  need  of  an  infant  feeding  program  to  prevent  malnutrition  and  early  death  are  now  getting  the  food  supplements  they  need  to  stay  alive  and  to  grow .PERIOD we've  started  the  first  malaria  treatment  programs  they've  ever  had  there .PERIOD patients  admitted  to  a  hospital  that  was  destroyed  during  the  genocide  that  we  have  renovated  along  with  four  other  clinics ,COMMA complete  with  solar  power  generators ,COMMA good  lab  technology .PERIOD we  now  are  treating  325  people  a  month ,COMMA despite  the  fact  that  almost  100  percent  of  the  aids  patients  are  now  treated  at  home .PERIOD and  the  most  important  thing  is  because  we've  implemented  paul  farmer  's  model ,COMMA using  community  health  workers ,COMMA we  estimate  that  this  system  could  be  put  into  place  for  all  of  rwanda  for  between  five  and  six  percent  of  gdp ,COMMA and  that  the  government  could  sustain  that  without  depending  on  foreign  aid  after  five  or  six  years .PERIOD and  for  those  of  you  who  understand  healthcare  economics  you  know  that  all  wealthy  countries  spend  between  nine  and  11  percent  of  gdp  on  health  care ,COMMA except  for  the  united  states ,COMMA we  spend  16 ,COMMA but  that  's  a  story  for  another  day .PERIOD we  're  now  working  with  partners  in  health  and  the  ministry  of  health  in  rwanda  and  our  foundation  folks  to  scale  this  system  up .PERIOD we  're  also  beginning  to  do  this  in  malawi  and  lesotho .PERIOD and  we  have  similar  projects  in  tanzania ,COMMA mozambique ,COMMA kenya  and  ethiopia  with  other  partners  trying  to  achieve  the  same  thing ,COMMA to  save  as  many  lives  as  quickly  as  we  can ,COMMA but  to  do  it  in  a  systematic  way  that  can  be  implemented  nationwide  and  then  with  a  model  that  can  be  implemented  in  any  country  in  the  world .PERIOD we  need  initial  upfront  investment  to  train  doctors ,COMMA nurses ,COMMA health  administration  and  community  health  workers  throughout  the  country ,COMMA to  set  up  the  information  technology ,COMMA the  solar  energy ,COMMA the  water  and  sanitation ,COMMA the  transportation  infrastructure .PERIOD but  over  a  five-  to  10-year  period ,COMMA we  will  take  down  the  need  for  outside  assistance  and  eventually  it  will  be  phased  out .PERIOD my  wish  is  that  ted  assist  us  in  our  work  and  help  us  to  build  a  high-quality  rural  health  system  in  a  poor  country ,COMMA rwanda ,COMMA that  can  be  a  model  for  africa ,COMMA and  indeed ,COMMA for  any  poor  country  anywhere  in  the  world .PERIOD my  belief  is  that  this  will  help  us  to  build  a  more  integrated  world  with  more  partners  and  fewer  terrorists ,COMMA with  more  productive  citizens  and  fewer  haters ,COMMA a  place  we'd  all  want  our  kids  and  our  grandchildren  to  grow  up  in .PERIOD it  has  been  an  honor  for  me ,COMMA particularly ,COMMA to  work  in  rwanda  where  we  also  have  a  major  economic  development  project  in  partnership  with  sir  tom  hunter ,COMMA the  scottish  philanthropist ,COMMA where  last  year  we ,COMMA using  the  same  thing  with  aids  drugs ,COMMA cut  the  cost  of  fertilizer  and  the  interest  rates  on  microcredit  loans  by  30  percent  and  achieved  three-  to  four-hundred  percent  increases  in  crop  yields  with  the  farmers .PERIOD these  people  have  been  through  a  lot  and  none  of  us ,COMMA most  of  all  me ,COMMA helped  them  when  they  were  on  the  verge  of  destroying  each  other .PERIOD we  're  undoing  that  now ,COMMA and  they  are  so  over  it  and  so  into  their  future .PERIOD we  're  doing  this  in  an  environmentally  responsible  way .PERIOD i  'm  doing  my  best  to  convince  them  not  to  run  the  electric  grid  to  the  35  percent  of  the  people  that  have  no  access ,COMMA but  to  do  it  with  clean  energy .PERIOD to  have  responsible  reforestation  projects .PERIOD the  rwandans ,COMMA interestingly  enough ,COMMA have  been  quite  good ,COMMA mr.  wilson ,COMMA in  preserving  their  topsoil .PERIOD there  's  a  couple  of  guys  from  southern  farming  families ,COMMA the  first  thing  i  did  when  i  went  out  to  this  place  was  to  get  down  on  my  hands  and  knees  and  dig  in  the  dirt  and  see  what  they'd  done  with  it .PERIOD we  have  a  chance  here  to  prove  that  a  country  that  almost  slaughtered  itself  out  of  existence  can  practice  reconciliation ,COMMA reorganize  itself ,COMMA focus  on  tomorrow  and  provide  comprehensive ,COMMA quality  health  care  with  minimal  outside  help .PERIOD i  am  grateful  for  this  prize ,COMMA and  i  will  use  it  to  that  end .PERIOD we  could  use  some  more  help  to  do  this ,COMMA but  think  of  what  it  would  mean  if  we  could  have  a  world-class  health  system  in  rwanda ,COMMA in  a  country  with  a  less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita  income ,COMMA one  that  could  save  hundreds  of  millions  of  lives  over  the  next  decade  if  applied  to  every  similarly  situated  country  on  earth .PERIOD it  's  worth  a  try  and  i  believe  it  would  succeed .PERIOD thank  you  and  god  bless  you .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  kind  of  believe  that  we  're  in  like  the  cave-painting  era  of  computer  interfaces .PERIOD like ,COMMA they  're  very  kind  of ,COMMA they  do  n't  go  as  deep  or  as  emotionally  engaging  as  they  possibly  could  be  and  i'd  like  to  change  all  that .PERIOD hit  me .PERIOD ok .PERIOD so  i  mean ,COMMA this  is  the  kind  of  status  quo  interface ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  very  flat ,COMMA kind  of  rigid .PERIOD and  ok ,COMMA so  you  could  sex  it  up  and  like  go  to  a  much  more  lickable  mac ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA but  really  it  's  the  kind  of  same  old  crap  we've  had  for  the  last ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA 30  years .PERIOD like  i  think  we  really  put  up  with  a  lot  of  crap  with  our  computers .PERIOD i  mean  it  's  point  and  click ,COMMA it  's  like  the  menus ,COMMA icons ,COMMA it  's  all  the  kind  of  same  thing .PERIOD and  so  one  kind  of  information  space  that  i  take  inspiration  from  is  my  real  desk .PERIOD it  's  so  much  more  subtle ,COMMA so  much  more  visceral ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA what  's  visible ,COMMA what  's  not .PERIOD and  i'd  like  to  bring  that  experience  to  the  desktop .PERIOD so  i  kind  of  have  a ,COMMA this  is  bumptop .PERIOD it  's  kind  of  like  a  new  approach  to  desktop  computing .PERIOD so  you  can  bump  things ,COMMA they  're  all  physically ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA manipulable  and  stuff .PERIOD and  instead  of  that  point  and  click ,COMMA it  's  like  a  push  and  pull ,COMMA things  collide  as  you'd  expect  them .PERIOD just  like  on  my  real  desk ,COMMA i  can ,COMMA let  me  just  grab  these  guys ,COMMA i  can  turn  things  into  piles  instead  of  just  the  folders  that  we  have .PERIOD and  once  things  are  in  a  pile  i  can  browse  them  by  throwing  them  into  a  grid .PERIOD or  you  know ,COMMA flip  through  them  like  a  book  or  i  can  lay  them  out  like  a  deck  of  cards .PERIOD when  they  're  laid  out ,COMMA i  can  pull  things  to  new  locations  or  delete  things  or  just  quickly  sort  a  whole  pile ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA just  immediately ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and  then ,COMMA it  's  all  smoothly  animated ,COMMA instead  of  these  jarring  changes  you  see  in  today  's  interfaces .PERIOD also ,COMMA if  i  want  to  add  something  to  a  pile ,COMMA well ,COMMA how  do  i  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK i  just  toss  it  to  the  pile ,COMMA and  it  's  added  right  to  the  top .PERIOD it  's  a  kind  of  nice  way .PERIOD also  some  of  the  stuff  we  can  do  is ,COMMA for  these  individual  icons  we  thought ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA how  can  we  play  with  the  idea  of  an  icon ,COMMA and  push  that  further ?QUESTIONMARK and  one  of  the  things  i  can  do  is  make  it  bigger  if  i  want  to  emphasize  it  and  make  it  more  important .PERIOD but  what  's  really  cool  is  that  since  there  's  a  physics  simulation  running  under  this ,COMMA it  's  actually  heavier .PERIOD so  the  lighter  stuff  does  n't  really  move  but  if  i  throw  it  at  the  lighter  guys ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK so  it  's  cute ,COMMA but  it  's  also  like  a  subtle  channel  of  conveying  information ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  heavy  so  it  feels  more  important .PERIOD so  it  's  kind  of  cool .PERIOD despite  computers  everywhere  paper  really  has  n't  disappeared ,COMMA because  it  has  a  lot  of ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA valuable  properties .PERIOD and  some  of  those  we  wanted  to  transfer  to  the  icons  in  our  system .PERIOD so  one  of  the  things  you  can  do  to  our  icons ,COMMA just  like  paper ,COMMA is  crease  them  and  fold  them .PERIOD just  like  paper .PERIOD remember ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA something  for  later .PERIOD or  if  you  want  to  be  destructive ,COMMA you  can  just  crumple  it  up  and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA toss  it  to  the  corner .PERIOD also  just  like  paper ,COMMA around  our  workspace  we  'll  pin  things  up  to  the  wall  to  remember  them  later ,COMMA and  i  can  do  the  same  thing  here ,COMMA and  you  know ,COMMA you  'll  see  post-it  notes  and  things  like  that  around  people  's  offices .PERIOD and  i  can  pull  them  off  when  i  want  to  work  with  them .PERIOD so ,COMMA one  of  the  criticisms  of  this  kind  of  approach  to  organization  is  that ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA okay ,COMMA well  my  real  desk  is  really  messy .PERIOD i  do  n't  want  that  mess  on  my  computer  so  one  thing  we  have  for  that  is  like  a  grid  align ,COMMA kind  of ,COMMA so  you  get  that  more  traditional  desktop .PERIOD things  are  kind  of  grid  aligned .PERIOD more  boring ,COMMA but  you  still  have  that  kind  of  colliding  and  bumping .PERIOD and  you  can  still  do  fun  things  like  make  shelves  on  your  desktop .PERIOD let  's  just  break  this  shelf .PERIOD okay ,COMMA that  shelf  broke .PERIOD i  think  beyond  the  icons ,COMMA i  think  another  really  cool  domain  for  this  software ,COMMA i  think  it  applies  to  more  than  just  icons  and  your  desktop ,COMMA but  browsing  photographs .PERIOD i  think  you  can  really  enrich  the  way  we  browse  our  photographs .PERIOD and  bring  it  to  that  kind  of  shoebox  of ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA photos  with  your  family  on  the  kitchen  table  kind  of  thing .PERIOD i  can  toss  these  things  around .PERIOD they  're  so  much  more  tangible  and  touchable ,COMMA and  you  know  i  can  double-click  on  something  to  take  a  look  at  it .PERIOD and  i  can  do  all  that  kind  of  same  stuff  i  showed  you  before .PERIOD so  i  can  pile  things  up ,COMMA i  can  flip  through  it ,COMMA i  can ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA okay ,COMMA let  's  move  this  photo  to  the  back ,COMMA let  's  delete  this  guy  here ,COMMA and  i  think  it  's  just  a  much  more  rich  kind  of  way  of  interacting  with  your  information .PERIOD and  that  's  bumptop .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD i  do  n't  understand  myself ,COMMA why  they  keep  talking  of  love ,COMMA if  they  come  near  me ,COMMA if  they  look  into  my  eyes  and  kiss  my  hand .PERIOD i  do  n't  understand  myself ,COMMA why  they  talk  of  magic ,COMMA that  no  one  withstands ,COMMA if  he  sees  me ,COMMA if  he  passes  by .PERIOD but  if  the  red  light  is  on  in  the  middle  of  the  night  and  everybody  listens  to  my  song ,COMMA then  it  is  plain  to  see .PERIOD my  lips ,COMMA they  give  so  fiery  a  kiss ,COMMA my  limbs ,COMMA they  are  supple  and  white .PERIOD it  is  written  for  me  in  the  stars ,COMMA thou  shalt  kiss ,COMMA thou  shalt  love .PERIOD my  feet ,COMMA they  glide  and  float ,COMMA my  eyes ,COMMA they  lure  and  glow .PERIOD and  i  dance  as  if  entranced ,COMMA cause  i  know ,COMMA my  lips  give  so  fiery  a  kiss .PERIOD in  my  veins ,COMMA runs  a  dancer  's  blood ,COMMA because  my  beautiful  mother  was  the  queen  of  dance  in  the  gilded  alcazar .PERIOD she  was  so  very  beautiful ,COMMA i  often  saw  her  in  my  dreams .PERIOD if  she  beat  the  tambourine  to  her  beguiling  dance ,COMMA all  eyes  were  glowing  admiringly .PERIOD she  reawakened  in  me ,COMMA mine  is  the  same  lot .PERIOD i  dance  like  her  at  midnight  and  from  deep  within  i  feel ,COMMA my  lips ,COMMA they  give  so  fiery  a  kiss ,COMMA my  limbs ,COMMA they  are  supple  and  white .PERIOD it  is  written  for  me  in  the  stars ,COMMA thou  shalt  kiss ,COMMA thou  shalt  love .PERIOD and  i  dance  as  if  entranced ,COMMA cause  i  know ,COMMA my  lips  give  so  fiery  a  kiss .PERIOD /transcript .PERIOD i  'm  not  quite  sure  whether  i  really  want  to  see  a  snare  drum  at  nine  o'clock  or  so  in  the  morning .PERIOD but  anyway ,COMMA it  's  just  great  to  see  such  a  full  theater ,COMMA and  really  i  must  thank  herbie  hancock  and  his  colleagues  for  such  a  great  presentation .PERIOD one  of  the  interesting  things ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA is  the  combination  of  that  raw  hand  on  the  instrument  and  technology ,COMMA and  of  course  what  he  said  about  listening  to  our  young  people .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA my  job  is  all  about  listening ,COMMA and  my  aim ,COMMA really ,COMMA is  to  teach  the  world  to  listen .PERIOD that  's  my  only  real  aim  in  life .PERIOD and  it  sounds  quite  simple ,COMMA but  actually  it  's  quite  a  big ,COMMA big  job .PERIOD because  you  know ,COMMA when  you  look  at  a  piece  of  music ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA if  i  just  open  my  little  motorbike  bag ,COMMA we  have  here ,COMMA hopefully ,COMMA a  piece  of  music  that  is  full  of  little  black  dots  on  the  page .PERIOD and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA we  open  it  up  and  i  read  the  music .PERIOD so  technically ,COMMA i  can  actually  read  this .PERIOD i  will  follow  the  instructions ,COMMA the  tempo  markings ,COMMA the  dynamics .PERIOD i  will  do  exactly  as  i  'm  told .PERIOD and  so  therefore ,COMMA because  time  is  short ,COMMA if  i  just  play  you  literally  the  first  maybe  two  lines  or  so .PERIOD it  's  very  straightforward .PERIOD there  's  nothing  too  difficult  about  the  piece .PERIOD but  here  i  'm  being  told  that  the  piece  of  music  is  very  quick .PERIOD i  'm  being  told  where  to  play  on  the  drum .PERIOD i  'm  being  told  which  part  of  the  stick  to  use .PERIOD and  i  'm  being  told  the  dynamic .PERIOD and  i  'm  also  being  told  that  the  drum  is  without  snares .PERIOD snares  on ,COMMA snares  off .PERIOD so  therefore ,COMMA if  i  translate  this  piece  of  music ,COMMA we  have  this  idea .PERIOD and  so  on .PERIOD my  career  would  probably  last  about  five  years .PERIOD however ,COMMA what  i  have  to  do  as  a  musician  is  do  everything  that  is  not  on  the  music .PERIOD everything  that  there  is  n't  time  to  learn  from  a  teacher ,COMMA or  to  talk  about ,COMMA even ,COMMA from  a  teacher .PERIOD but  it  's  the  things  that  you  notice  when  you  're  not  actually  with  your  instrument  that  in  fact  become  so  interesting ,COMMA and  that  you  want  to  explore  through  this  tiny ,COMMA tiny  surface  of  a  drum .PERIOD so  there ,COMMA we  experience  the  translation .PERIOD now  we  'll  experience  the  interpretation .PERIOD now  my  career  may  last  a  little  longer .PERIOD but  in  a  way ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA it  's  the  same  if  i  look  at  you  and  i  see  a  nice  bright  young  lady  with  a  pink  top  on .PERIOD i  see  that  you  're  clutching  a  teddy  bear ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD so  i  get  a  basic  idea  as  to  what  you  might  be  about ,COMMA what  you  might  like ,COMMA what  you  might  do  as  a  profession ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD however ,COMMA that  's  just ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA the  initial  idea  i  may  have  that  we  all  get  when  we  actually  look ,COMMA and  we  try  to  interpret ,COMMA but  actually  it  's  so  unbelievably  shallow .PERIOD in  the  same  way ,COMMA i  look  at  the  music .PERIOD i  get  a  basic  idea .PERIOD i  wonder  what  technically  might  be  hard ,COMMA or ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA what  i  want  to  do .PERIOD just  the  basic  feeling .PERIOD however ,COMMA that  is  simply  not  enough .PERIOD and  i  think  what  herbie  said ,COMMA please  listen ,COMMA listen .PERIOD we  have  to  listen  to  ourselves ,COMMA first  of  all .PERIOD if  i  play ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA holding  the  stick ,COMMA where  literally  i  do  not  let  go  of  the  stick ,COMMA you  'll  experience  quite  a  lot  of  shock  coming  up  through  the  arm .PERIOD and  you  feel  really  quite ,COMMA believe  it  or  not ,COMMA detached  from  the  instrument  and  from  the  stick ,COMMA even  though  i  'm  actually  holding  the  stick  quite  tightly .PERIOD by  holding  it  tightly ,COMMA i  feel  strangely  more  detached .PERIOD if  i  just  simply  let  go  and  allow  my  hand ,COMMA my  arm ,COMMA to  be  more  of  a  support  system ,COMMA suddenly  i  have  more  dynamic  with  less  effort .PERIOD much  more .PERIOD and  i  just  feel ,COMMA at  last ,COMMA one  with  the  stick  and  one  with  the  drum .PERIOD and  i  'm  doing  far ,COMMA far  less .PERIOD so  in  the  same  way  that  i  need  time  with  this  instrument ,COMMA i  need  time  with  people  in  order  to  interpret  them .PERIOD not  just  translate  them ,COMMA but  interpret  them .PERIOD if ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA i  play  just  a  few  bars  of  a  piece  of  music  for  which  i  think  of  myself  as  a  technician ,COMMA that  is ,COMMA someone  who  is  basically  a  percussion  player .PERIOD and  so  on .PERIOD if  i  think  of  myself  as  a  musician .PERIOD and  so  on .PERIOD there  is  a  little  bit  of  a  difference  there  that  is  worth  just ,COMMA thinking  about .PERIOD and  i  remember  when  i  was  12  years  old ,COMMA and  i  started  playing  tympani  and  percussion ,COMMA and  my  teacher  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how  are  we  going  to  do  this ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ,COMMA music  is  about  listening .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA yes ,COMMA i  agree  with  that .PERIOD so  what  's  the  problem ?QUESTIONMARK and  he  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how  are  you  going  to  hear  this ?QUESTIONMARK how  are  you  going  to  hear  that ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA how  do  you  hear  it ?QUESTIONMARK he  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  think  i  hear  it  through  here .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  think  i  do  too ,COMMA but  i  also  hear  it  through  my  hands ,COMMA through  my  arms ,COMMA cheekbones ,COMMA my  scalp ,COMMA my  tummy ,COMMA my  chest ,COMMA my  legs  and  so  on .PERIOD and  so  we  began  our  lessons  every  single  time  tuning  drums ,COMMA in  particular ,COMMA the  kettle  drums ,COMMA or  tympani ,COMMA to  such  a  narrow  pitch  interval ,COMMA so  something  like .PERIOD that  of  a  difference .PERIOD then  gradually .PERIOD and  gradually .PERIOD and  it  's  amazing  that  when  you  do  open  your  body  up ,COMMA and  open  your  hand  up  to  allow  the  vibration  to  come  through ,COMMA that  in  fact  the  tiny ,COMMA tiny  difference .PERIOD can  be  felt  with  just  the  tiniest  part  of  your  finger ,COMMA there .PERIOD and  so  what  we  would  do  is  that  i  would  put  my  hands  on  the  wall  of  the  music  room ,COMMA and  together  we  would  listen  to  the  sounds  of  the  instruments ,COMMA and  really  try  to  connect  with  those  sounds  far ,COMMA far  more  broadly  than  simply  depending  on  the  ear .PERIOD because  of  course ,COMMA the  ear  is ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA subject  to  all  sorts  of  things .PERIOD the  room  we  happen  to  be  in ,COMMA the  amplification ,COMMA the  quality  of  the  instrument ,COMMA the  type  of  sticks .PERIOD etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD they  're  all  different .PERIOD same  amount  of  weight ,COMMA but  different  sound  colors .PERIOD and  that  's  basically  what  we  are .PERIOD we  're  just  human  beings ,COMMA but  we  all  have  our  own  little  sound  colors ,COMMA as  it  were ,COMMA that  make  up  these  extraordinary  personalities  and  characters  and  interests  and  things .PERIOD and  as  i  grew  older ,COMMA i  then  auditioned  for  the  royal  academy  of  music  in  london ,COMMA and  they  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA no ,COMMA we  wo  n't  accept  you ,COMMA because  we  have  n't  a  clue ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA of  the  future  of  a  so-called  deaf  musician .PERIOD and  i  just  could  n't  quite  accept  that .PERIOD and  so  therefore ,COMMA i  said  to  them ,COMMA well ,COMMA look ,COMMA if  you  refuse ,COMMA if  you  refuse  me  through  those  reasons ,COMMA as  opposed  to  the  ability  to  perform  and  to  understand  and  love  the  art  of  creating  sound ,COMMA then  we  have  to  think  very ,COMMA very  hard  about  the  people  you  do  actually  accept .PERIOD and  as  a  result ,COMMA once  we  got  over  a  little  hurdle ,COMMA and  having  to  audition  twice ,COMMA they  accepted  me .PERIOD and  not  only  that ,COMMA what  had  happened  was  that  it  changed  the  whole  role  of  the  music  institutions  throughout  the  united  kingdom .PERIOD under  no  circumstances  were  they  to  refuse  any  application  whatsoever  on  the  basis  of  whether  someone  had  no  arms ,COMMA no  legs ,COMMA they  could  still  perhaps  play  a  wind  instrument  if  it  was  supported  on  a  stand .PERIOD no  circumstances  at  all  were  used  to  refuse  any  entry .PERIOD and  every  single  entry  had  to  be  listened  to ,COMMA experienced  and  then  based  on  the  musical  ability ,COMMA then  that  person  could  either  enter  or  not .PERIOD so  therefore ,COMMA this  in  turn  meant  that  there  was  an  extremely  interesting  bunch  of  students  who  arrived  in  these  various  music  institutions .PERIOD and  i  have  to  say ,COMMA many  of  them  now  in  the  professional  orchestras  throughout  the  world .PERIOD the  interesting  thing  about  this  as  well ,COMMA though ,COMMA is  quite  simply  that  not  only  were  people  connected  with  sound ,COMMA which  is  basically  all  of  us ,COMMA and  we  well  know  that  music  really  is  our  daily  medicine .PERIOD i  say  music ,COMMA but  actually  i  mean  sound .PERIOD because  you  know ,COMMA some  of  the  extraordinary  things  i've  experienced  as  a  musician ,COMMA when  you  may  have  a  15-year-old  lad  who  has  got  the  most  incredible  challenges ,COMMA who  may  not  be  able  to  control  his  movements ,COMMA who  may  be  deaf ,COMMA who  may  be  blind ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD -- .PERIOD suddenly ,COMMA if  that  young  lad  sits  close  to  this  instrument ,COMMA and  perhaps  even  lies  underneath  the  marimba ,COMMA and  you  play  something  that  's  so  incredibly  organ-like ,COMMA almost ,COMMA i  do  n't  really  have  the  right  sticks ,COMMA perhaps ,COMMA but  something  like  this .PERIOD let  me  change .PERIOD something  that  's  so  unbelievably  simple ,COMMA but  he  would  be  experiencing  something  that  i  would  n't  be ,COMMA because  i  'm  on  top  of  the  sound .PERIOD i  have  the  sound  coming  this  way .PERIOD he  would  have  the  sound  coming  through  the  resonators .PERIOD if  there  were  no  resonators  on  here ,COMMA we  would  have .PERIOD so  he  would  have  a  fullness  of  sound  that  those  of  you  in  the  front  few  rows  would  n't  experience ,COMMA those  of  you  in  the  back  few  rows  would  n't  experience  either .PERIOD every  single  one  of  us ,COMMA depending  on  where  we  're  sitting ,COMMA will  experience  this  sound  quite ,COMMA quite  differently .PERIOD and  of  course ,COMMA being  the  participator  of  the  sound ,COMMA and  that  is  starting  from  the  idea  of  what  type  of  sound  i  want  to  produce ,COMMA for  example ,COMMA this  sound .PERIOD can  you  hear  anything ?QUESTIONMARK exactly .PERIOD because  i  'm  not  even  touching  it .PERIOD but  yet ,COMMA we  get  the  sensation  of  something  happening .PERIOD in  the  same  way  that  when  i  see  tree  moves ,COMMA then  i  imagine  that  tree  making  a  rustling  sound .PERIOD do  you  see  what  i  mean ?QUESTIONMARK whatever  the  eye  sees ,COMMA then  there  's  always  sound  happening .PERIOD so  there  's  always ,COMMA always  that  huge ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA just  this  kaleidoscope  of  things  to  draw  from .PERIOD so  all  of  my  performances  are  based  on  entirely  what  i  experience ,COMMA and  not  by  learning  a  piece  of  music ,COMMA putting  on  someone  else  's  interpretation  of  it ,COMMA buying  all  the  cds  possible  of  that  particular  piece  of  music ,COMMA and  so  on  and  so  forth .PERIOD because  that  is  n't  giving  me  enough  of  something  that  is  so  raw  and  so  basic ,COMMA and  something  that  i  can  fully  experience  the  journey  of .PERIOD so  it  may  be  that ,COMMA in  certain  halls ,COMMA this  dynamic  may  well  work .PERIOD it  may  be  that  in  other  halls ,COMMA they  're  simply  not  going  to  experience  that  at  all  and  so  therefore ,COMMA my  level  of  soft ,COMMA gentle  playing  may  have  to  be .PERIOD do  you  see  what  i  mean ?QUESTIONMARK so ,COMMA because  of  this  explosion  in  access  to  sound ,COMMA especially  through  the  deaf  community ,COMMA this  has  not  only  affected  how  music  institutions ,COMMA how  schools  for  the  deaf  treat  sound ,COMMA and  not  just  as  a  means  of  therapy ,COMMA although  of  course ,COMMA being  a  participator  of  music ,COMMA that  definitely  is  the  case  as  well .PERIOD but  it  's  meant  that  acousticians  have  had  to  really  think  about  the  types  of  halls  they  put  together .PERIOD there  are  so  few  halls  in  this  world  that  actually  have  very  good  acoustics ,COMMA dare  i  say .PERIOD but  by  that  i  mean  where  you  can  absolutely  do  anything  you  imagine .PERIOD the  tiniest ,COMMA softest ,COMMA softest  sound  to  something  that  is  so  broad ,COMMA so  huge ,COMMA so  incredible .PERIOD there  's  always  something ,COMMA it  may  sound  good  up  there ,COMMA may  not  be  so  good  there .PERIOD may  be  great  there ,COMMA but  terrible  up  there .PERIOD maybe  terrible  over  there ,COMMA but  not  too  bad  there ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD so  to  find  an  actual  hall  is  incredible ,COMMA for  which  you  can  play  exactly  what  you  imagine ,COMMA without  it  being  cosmetically  enhanced .PERIOD and  so  therefore ,COMMA acousticians  are  actually  in  conversation  with  people  who  are  hearing  impaired ,COMMA and  who  are  participators  of  sound .PERIOD and  this  is  quite  interesting .PERIOD i  cannot ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA give  you  any  detail  as  far  as  what  is  actually  happening  with  those  halls ,COMMA but  it  's  just  the  fact  that  they  are  going  to  a  group  of  people  for  whom  so  many  years  we've  been  saying ,COMMA well ,COMMA how  on  earth  can  they  experience  music ?QUESTIONMARK you  know ,COMMA they  're  deaf .PERIOD we  just ,COMMA we  go  like  that ,COMMA and  we  imagine  that  that  's  what  deafness  is  about .PERIOD or  we  go  like  that ,COMMA and  we  imagine  that  's  what  blindness  is  about .PERIOD if  we  see  someone  in  a  wheelchair ,COMMA we  assume  they  cannot  walk .PERIOD it  may  be  that  they  can  walk  three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five  steps .PERIOD that ,COMMA to  them ,COMMA means  they  can  walk .PERIOD in  a  year  's  time ,COMMA it  could  be  two  extra  steps .PERIOD in  another  year  's  time ,COMMA three  extra  steps .PERIOD those  are  hugely  important  aspects  to  think  about .PERIOD so  when  we  do  listen  to  each  other ,COMMA it  's  unbelievably  important  for  us  to  really  test  our  listening  skills .PERIOD to  really  use  our  bodies  as  a  resonating  chamber ,COMMA to  stop  the  judgment .PERIOD for  me ,COMMA as  a  musician  who  deals  with  99  percent  of  new  music ,COMMA it  's  very  easy  for  me  to  say ,COMMA oh  yes ,COMMA i  like  that  piece .PERIOD oh  no ,COMMA i  do  n't  like  that  piece  and  so  on .PERIOD and  you  know ,COMMA i  just  find  that  i  have  to  give  those  pieces  of  music  real  time .PERIOD it  may  be  that  the  chemistry  is  n't  quite  right  between  myself  and  that  particular  piece  of  music .PERIOD but  that  does  n't  mean  i  have  the  right  to  say  it  's  a  bad  piece  of  music .PERIOD and  you  know ,COMMA it  's  just  one  of  the  great  things  about  being  a  musician ,COMMA is  that  it  is  so  unbelievably  fluid .PERIOD so  there  are  no  rules ,COMMA no  right ,COMMA no  wrong ,COMMA this  way ,COMMA that  way .PERIOD if  i  asked  you  to  clap ,COMMA maybe  i  can  do  this .PERIOD if  i  can  just  say ,COMMA please  clap  and  create  the  sound  of  thunder .PERIOD i  'm  assuming  we've  all  experienced  thunder .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  do  n't  mean  just  the  sound .PERIOD i  mean  really  listen  to  that  thunder  within  yourselves .PERIOD

perfectly  terrible  things  about  saddam  hussein  constantly ,COMMA which  he  deserved ,COMMA he  had  invaded  another  country .PERIOD and  so  all  of  a  sudden ,COMMA a  poem  appeared  in  the  papers  in  baghdad  comparing  me  to  many  things ,COMMA but  among  them  an  unparalleled  serpent .PERIOD and  so  i  happened  to  have  a  snake  pin .PERIOD so  i  wore  it  when  we  talked  about  iraq .PERIOD and  when  i  went  out  to  meet  the  press ,COMMA they  zeroed  in ,COMMA said ,COMMA why  are  you  wearing  that  snake  pin ?QUESTIONMARK i  said ,COMMA because  saddam  hussein  compared  me  to  an  unparalleled  serpent .PERIOD and  then  i  thought ,COMMA well  this  is  fun .PERIOD so  i  went  out  and  i  bought  a  lot  of  pins  that  would ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA reflect  what  i  thought  we  were  going  to  do  on  any  given  day .PERIOD so  that  's  how  it  all  started .PERIOD pm ,COMMA so  how  large  is  the  collection ?QUESTIONMARK ma ,COMMA pretty  big .PERIOD it  's  now  traveling .PERIOD at  the  moment  it  's  in  indianapolis ,COMMA but  it  was  at  the  smithsonian .PERIOD and  it  goes  with  a  book  that  says ,COMMA read  my  pins  pm ,COMMA so  is  this  a  good  idea .PERIOD i  remember  when  you  were  the  first  woman  as  secretary  of  state ,COMMA and  there  was  a  lot  of  conversation  always  about  what  you  were  wearing ,COMMA how  you  looked ,COMMA the  thing  that  happens  to  a  lot  of  women ,COMMA especially  if  they  're  the  first  in  a  position .PERIOD so  how  do  you  feel  about  that ,COMMA the  whole  -- .PERIOD ma ,COMMA well ,COMMA it  's  pretty  irritating  actually  because  nobody  ever  describes  what  a  man  is  wearing .PERIOD but  people  did  pay  attention  to  what  clothes  i  had .PERIOD what  was  interesting  was  that ,COMMA before  i  went  up  to  new  york  as  un .PERIOD ambassador ,COMMA i  talked  to  jeane  kirkpatrick ,COMMA who'd  been  ambassador  before  me ,COMMA and  she  said ,COMMA you've  got  to  get  rid  of  your  professor  clothes .PERIOD go  out  and  look  like  a  diplomat .PERIOD so  that  did  give  me  a  lot  of  opportunities  to  go  shopping .PERIOD but  still ,COMMA there  were  all  kinds  of  questions  about ,COMMA did  you  wear  a  hat  how  short  was  your  skirt ?QUESTIONMARK and  one  of  the  things ,COMMA if  you  remember  condoleezza  rice  was  at  some  event  and  she  wore  boots ,COMMA and  she  got  criticized  over  that .PERIOD and  no  guy  ever  gets  criticized .PERIOD but  that  's  the  least  of  it .PERIOD pm ,COMMA it  is ,COMMA for  all  of  us ,COMMA men  and  women ,COMMA finding  our  ways  of  defining  our  roles ,COMMA and  doing  them  in  ways  that  make  a  difference  in  the  world  and  shape  the  future .PERIOD how  did  you  handle  that  balance  between  being  the  tough  diplomatic  and  strong  voice  of  this  country  to  the  rest  of  the  world  and  also  how  you  felt  about  yourself  as  a  mother ,COMMA a  grandmother ,COMMA nurturing .PERIOD and  so  how  did  you  handle  that ?QUESTIONMARK ma ,COMMA well  the  interesting  part  was  i  was  asked  what  it  was  like  to  be  the  first  woman  secretary  of  state  a  few  minutes  after  i'd  been  named .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA well  i've  been  a  woman  for  60  years ,COMMA but  i've  only  been  secretary  of  state  for  a  few  minutes .PERIOD so  it  evolved .PERIOD but  basically  i  love  being  a  woman .PERIOD and  so  what  happened ,COMMA and  i  think  there  will  probably  be  some  people  in  the  audience  that  will  identify  with  this ,COMMA i  went  to  my  first  meeting ,COMMA first  at  the  un ,COMMA and  that  's  when  this  all  started ,COMMA because  that  is  a  very  male  organization .PERIOD and  i  'm  sitting  there ,COMMA there  are  15  members  of  the  security  council ,COMMA so  14  men  sat  there  staring  at  me ,COMMA and  i  thought ,COMMA well  you  know  how  we  all  are .PERIOD you  want  to  get  the  feeling  of  the  room ,COMMA and  do  people  like  me  and  will  i  really  say  something  intelligent ?QUESTIONMARK and  all  of  a  sudden  i  thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA wait  a  minute .PERIOD i  am  sitting  behind  a  sign  that  says  the  united  states,' .PERIOD and  if  i  do  n't  speak  today  then  the  voice  of  the  united  states  will  not  be  heard .PERIOD and  it  was  the  first  time  that  i  had  that  feeling  that  i  had  to  step  out  of  myself  in  my  normal ,COMMA reluctant  female  mode  and  decide  that  i  had  to  speak  on  behalf  of  our  country .PERIOD and  so  that  happened  more  at  various  times ,COMMA but  i  really  think  that  there  was  a  great  advantage  in  many  ways  to  being  a  woman .PERIOD i  think  we  are  a  lot  better  at  personal  relationships ,COMMA and  then  have  the  capability  obviously  of  telling  it  like  it  is  when  it  's  necessary .PERIOD but  i  have  to  tell  you ,COMMA i  have  my  youngest  granddaughter ,COMMA when  she  turned  seven  last  year ,COMMA said  to  her  mother ,COMMA my  daughter ,COMMA so  what  's  the  big  deal  about  grandma  maddie  being  secretary  of  state ?QUESTIONMARK only  girls  are  secretary  of  state .PERIOD pm ,COMMA because  in  her  lifetime ,COMMA ma ,COMMA that  would  be  so .PERIOD as  you  travel  now  all  over  the  world ,COMMA which  you  do  frequently ,COMMA how  do  you  assess  this  global  narrative  around  the  story  of  women  and  girls ?QUESTIONMARK where  are  we ?QUESTIONMARK ma ,COMMA i  think  we  're  slowly  changing ,COMMA but  obviously  there  are  whole  pockets  in  countries  where  nothing  is  different .PERIOD and  therefore  it  means  that  we  have  to  remember  that ,COMMA while  many  of  us  have  had  huge  opportunities ,COMMA and  pat ,COMMA you  have  been  a  real  leader  in  your  field ,COMMA is  that  there  are  a  lot  of  women  that  are  not  capable  of  worrying  and  taking  care  of  themselves  and  understanding  that  women  have  to  help  other  women .PERIOD and  so  what  i  have  felt ,COMMA and  i  have  looked  at  this  from  a  national  security  issue ,COMMA when  i  was  secretary  of  state ,COMMA i  decided  that  women  's  issues  had  to  be  central  to  american  foreign  policy ,COMMA not  just  because  i  'm  a  feminist ,COMMA but  because  i  believe  that  societies  are  better  off  when  women  are  politically  and  economically  empowered ,COMMA that  values  are  passed  down ,COMMA the  health  situation  is  better ,COMMA education  is  better ,COMMA there  is  greater  economic  prosperity .PERIOD so  i  think  that  it  behooves  us ,COMMA those  of  us  that  live  in  various  countries  where  we  do  have  economic  and  political  voice ,COMMA that  we  need  to  help  other  women .PERIOD and  i  really  dedicated  myself  to  that ,COMMA both  at  the  un .PERIOD and  then  as  secretary  of  state .PERIOD pm ,COMMA and  did  you  get  pushback  from  making  that  a  central  tenant  of  foreign  policy ?QUESTIONMARK ma ,COMMA from  some  people .PERIOD i  think  that  they  thought  that  it  was  a  soft  issue .PERIOD the  bottom  line  that  i  decided  was  actually  women  's  issues  are  the  hardest  issues ,COMMA because  they  are  the  ones  that  have  to  do  with  life  and  death  in  so  many  aspects ,COMMA and  because ,COMMA as  i  said ,COMMA it  is  really  central  to  the  way  that  we  think  about  things .PERIOD now  for  instance ,COMMA some  of  the  wars  that  took  place  when  i  was  in  office ,COMMA a  lot  of  them ,COMMA the  women  were  the  main  victims  of  it .PERIOD for  instance ,COMMA when  i  started ,COMMA there  were  wars  in  the  balkans .PERIOD the  women  in  bosnia  were  being  raped .PERIOD we  then  managed  to  set  up  a  war  crimes  tribunal  to  deal  specifically  with  those  kinds  of  issues .PERIOD and  by  the  way ,COMMA one  of  the  things  that  i  did  at  that  stage  was ,COMMA i  had  just  arrived  at  the  un ,COMMA and  when  i  was  there ,COMMA there  were  183  countries  in  the  un .PERIOD now  there  are  192 .PERIOD but  it  was  one  of  the  first  times  that  i  did  n't  have  to  cook  lunch  myself .PERIOD so  i  said  to  my  assistant ,COMMA invite  the  other  women  permanent  representatives .PERIOD and  i  thought  when  i'd  get  to  my  apartment  that  there'd  be  a  lot  of  women  there .PERIOD i  get  there ,COMMA and  there  are  six  other  women ,COMMA out  of  183 .PERIOD so  the  countries  that  had  women  representatives  were  canada ,COMMA kazakhstan ,COMMA philippines ,COMMA trinidad  tobago ,COMMA jamaica ,COMMA lichtenstein  and  me .PERIOD so  being  an  american ,COMMA i  decided  to  set  up  a  caucus .PERIOD and  so  we  set  it  up ,COMMA and  we  called  ourselves  the  g7 .PERIOD pm ,COMMA is  that  girl  7  ma ,COMMA girl  7 .PERIOD and  we  lobbied  on  behalf  of  women  's  issues .PERIOD so  we  managed  to  get  two  women  judges  on  this  war  crimes  tribunal .PERIOD and  then  what  happened  was  that  they  were  able  to  declare  that  rape  was  a  weapon  of  war ,COMMA that  it  was  against  humanity .PERIOD pm ,COMMA so  when  you  look  around  the  world  and  you  see  that ,COMMA in  many  cases ,COMMA certainly  in  the  western  world ,COMMA women  are  evolving  into  more  leadership  positions ,COMMA and  even  other  places  some  barriers  are  being  brought  down ,COMMA but  there  's  still  so  much  violence ,COMMA still  so  many  problems ,COMMA and  yet  we  hear  there  are  more  women  at  the  negotiating  tables .PERIOD now  you  were  at  those  negotiating  tables  when  they  were  n't ,COMMA when  there  was  maybe  you ,COMMA one  voice ,COMMA maybe  one  or  two  others .PERIOD do  you  believe ,COMMA and  can  you  tell  us  why ,COMMA there  is  going  to  be  a  significant  shift  in  things  like  violence  and  peace  and  conflict  and  resolution  on  a  sustainable  basis ?QUESTIONMARK ma ,COMMA well  i  do  think ,COMMA when  there  are  more  women ,COMMA that  the  tone  of  the  conversation  changes ,COMMA and  also  the  goals  of  the  conversation  change .PERIOD but  it  does  n't  mean  that  the  whole  world  would  be  a  lot  better  if  it  were  totally  run  by  women .PERIOD if  you  think  that ,COMMA you've  forgotten  high  school .PERIOD but  the  bottom  line  is  that  there  is  a  way ,COMMA when  there  are  more  women  at  the  table ,COMMA that  there  's  an  attempt  to  develop  some  understanding .PERIOD so  for  instance ,COMMA what  i  did  when  i  went  to  burundi ,COMMA we'd  got  tutsi  and  hutu  women  together  to  talk  about  some  of  the  problems  that  had  taken  place  in  rwanda .PERIOD and  so  i  think  the  capability  of  women  to  put  themselves ,COMMA i  think  we  're  better  about  putting  ourselves  into  the  other  guy  's  shoes .PERIOD and  having  more  empathy .PERIOD i  think  it  helps  in  terms  of  the  support  if  there  are  other  women  in  the  room .PERIOD when  i  was  secretary  of  state ,COMMA there  were  only  13  other  women  foreign  ministers .PERIOD and  so  it  was  nice  when  one  of  them  would  show  up .PERIOD for  instance ,COMMA she  is  now  the  president  of  finland ,COMMA but  tarja  halonen  was  the  foreign  minister  of  finland  and ,COMMA at  a  certain  stage ,COMMA head  of  the  european  union .PERIOD and  it  was  really  terrific .PERIOD because  one  of  the  things  i  think  you  'll  understand .PERIOD we  went  to  a  meeting ,COMMA and  the  men  in  my  delegation ,COMMA when  i  would  say ,COMMA well  i  feel  we  should  do  something  about  this ,COMMA and  they'd  say ,COMMA what  do  you  mean ,COMMA you  feel ?QUESTIONMARK and  so  then  tarja  was  sitting  across  the  table  from  me .PERIOD and  all  of  a  sudden  we  were  talking  about  arms  control ,COMMA and  she  said ,COMMA well  i  feel  we  should  do  this .PERIOD and  my  male  colleagues  kind  of  got  it  all  of  a  sudden .PERIOD but  i  think  it  really  does  help  to  have  a  critical  mass  of  women  in  a  series  of  foreign  policy  positions .PERIOD the  other  thing  that  i  think  is  really  important ,COMMA a  lot  of  national  security  policy  is  n't  just  about  foreign  policy ,COMMA but  it  's  about  budgets ,COMMA military  budgets ,COMMA and  how  the  debts  of  countries  work  out .PERIOD so  if  you  have  women  in  a  variety  of  foreign  policy  posts ,COMMA they  can  support  each  other  when  there  are  budget  decisions  being  made  in  their  own  countries .PERIOD pm ,COMMA so  how  do  we  get  this  balance  we  're  looking  for ,COMMA then ,COMMA in  the  world ?QUESTIONMARK more  women  's  voices  at  the  table ?QUESTIONMARK more  men  who  believe  that  the  balance  is  best ?QUESTIONMARK ma ,COMMA well  i  think  one  of  the  things ,COMMA i  'm  chairman  of  the  board  of  an  organization  called  the  national  democratic  institute  that  works  to  support  women  candidates .PERIOD i  think  that  we  need  to  help  in  other  countries  to  train  women  to  be  in  political  office ,COMMA to  figure  out  how  they  can  in  fact  develop  political  voices .PERIOD i  think  we  also  need  to  be  supportive  when  businesses  are  being  created  and  just  make  sure  that  women  help  each  other .PERIOD now  i  have  a  saying  that  i  feel  very  strongly  about ,COMMA because  i  am  of  a  certain  age  where ,COMMA when  i  started  in  my  career ,COMMA believe  it  or  not ,COMMA there  were  other  women  who  criticized  me ,COMMA why  are  n't  you  in  the  carpool  line ?QUESTIONMARK or  are  n't  your  children  suffering  because  you  're  not  there  all  the  time ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  think  we  have  a  tendency  to  make  each  other  feel  guilty .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA i  think  guilt  is  every  woman  's  middle  name .PERIOD and  so  i  think  what  needs  to  happen  is  we  need  to  help  each  other .PERIOD and  my  motto  is  that  there  's  a  special  place  in  hell  for  women  who  do  n't  help  each  other .PERIOD pm ,COMMA well  secretary  albright ,COMMA i  guess  you  'll  be  going  to  heaven .PERIOD thank  you  for  joining  us  today .PERIOD ma ,COMMA thank  you  all .PERIOD thanks  pat .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  try  to  give  you  a  view  of  the  world  as  i  see  it ,COMMA the  problems  and  the  opportunities  that  we  face ,COMMA and  then  ask  the  question  if  we  should  be  optimistic  or  pessimistic .PERIOD and  then  i  'll  let  you  in  on  a  secret ,COMMA which  is  why  i  am  an  incurable  optimist .PERIOD let  me  start  off  showing  you  an  al  gore  movie  that  you  may  have  seen  before .PERIOD now ,COMMA you've  all  seen  inconvenient  truth  this  is  a  little  more  inconvenient .PERIOD  ,COMMA man .PERIOD extremely  dangerous  questions .PERIOD because ,COMMA with  our  present  knowledge ,COMMA we  have  no  idea  what  would  happen .PERIOD even  now ,COMMA man  may  be  unwittingly  changing  the  world  's  climate  through  the  waste  products  of  his  civilization .PERIOD due  to  our  release ,COMMA

to  be  getting  warmer .PERIOD this  is  bad ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA it  's  been  calculated  a  few  degrees  rise  in  the  earth  's  temperature  would  melt  the  polar  ice  caps .PERIOD and  if  this  happens ,COMMA an  inland  sea  would  fill  a  good  portion  of  the  mississippi  valley .PERIOD tourists  in  glass-bottomed  boats  would  be  viewing  the  drowned  towers  of  miami  through  150  feet  of  tropical  water .PERIOD for ,COMMA in  weather ,COMMA we  're  not  only  dealing  with  forces  of  a  far  greater  variety  than  even  the  atomic  physicist  encounters ,COMMA but  with  life  itself .PERIOD larry  brilliant ,COMMA should  we  feel  good ,COMMA or  should  we  feel  bad  that  50  years  of  foreknowledge  accomplished  so  little ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA it  depends ,COMMA really ,COMMA on  what  your  goals  are .PERIOD and  i  think ,COMMA as  my  goals ,COMMA i  always  go  back  to  gandhi  's  talisman .PERIOD when  mahatma  gandhi  was  asked ,COMMA how  do  you  know  if  the  next  act  that  you  are  about  to  do  is  the  right  one  or  the  wrong  one  he  said ,COMMA consider  the  face  of  the  poorest ,COMMA most  vulnerable  human  being  that  you  ever  chanced  upon ,COMMA and  ask  yourself  if  the  act  that  you  contemplate  will  be  of  benefit  to  that  person .PERIOD and  if  it  will  be ,COMMA it  's  the  right  thing  to  do ,COMMA and  if  not ,COMMA rethink  it .PERIOD for  those  of  us  in  this  room ,COMMA it  's  not  just  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable  individual ,COMMA it  's  the  community ,COMMA it  's  the  culture ,COMMA it  's  the  world  itself .PERIOD and  the  trends  for  those  who  are  at  the  periphery  of  our  society ,COMMA who  are  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable ,COMMA the  trends  give  rise  to  a  great  case  for  pessimism .PERIOD but  there  's  also  a  wonderful  case  for  optimism .PERIOD let  's  review  them

hurt  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable .PERIOD that  's  why  they  migrate  to  cities .PERIOD that  's  why  in  june  of  this  year ,COMMA we  passed ,COMMA as  a  species ,COMMA 51

.PERIOD but  it  has  a  dark  side ,COMMA in  bioweapons ,COMMA and  in  technology  that  puts  us  on  a  collision  course  to  magnify  any  anger ,COMMA hatred  or  feeling  of  marginalization .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA with  increasing  globalization ,COMMA for  which  there  are  big  winners  and  even  bigger  losers ,COMMA today  the  world  is  more  diverse  and  unfair  than

,COMMA that  i  ever  saw  in  my  life .PERIOD and  this  picture  here ,COMMA it  's  really  interesting ,COMMA it  shows  two  things: .PERIOD first  of  all ,COMMA it  's  in  black  and  white  because  the  water  was  so  clear  and  you  could  see  so  far ,COMMA and  film  was  so  slow  in  the  1960s  and  early  70s ,COMMA you  took  pictures  in  black  and  white .PERIOD the  other  thing  it  shows  you  is  that ,COMMA although  there  's  this  beautiful  forest  of  coral ,COMMA there  are  no  fish  in  that  picture .PERIOD those  reefs  at  discovery  bay ,COMMA jamaica  were  the  most  studied  coral  reefs  in  the  world  for  20  years .PERIOD we  were  the  best  and  the  brightest .PERIOD people  came  to  study  our  reefs  from  australia ,COMMA which  is  sort  of  funny  because  now  we  go  to  theirs .PERIOD and  the  view  of  scientists  about  how  coral  reefs  work ,COMMA how  they  ought  to  be ,COMMA was  based  on  these  reefs  without  any  fish .PERIOD then ,COMMA in  1980 ,COMMA there  was  a  hurricane ,COMMA hurricane  allen .PERIOD i  put  half  the  lab  up  in  my  house .PERIOD the  wind  blew  very  strong .PERIOD the  waves  were  25  to  50  feet  high .PERIOD and  the  reefs  disappeared ,COMMA and  new  islands  formed .PERIOD and  we  thought ,COMMA well ,COMMA we  're  real  smart .PERIOD we  know  that  hurricanes  have  always  happened  in  the  past .PERIOD and  we  published  a  paper  in  science ,COMMA the  first  time  that  anybody  ever  described  the  destruction  on  a  coral  reef  by  a  major  hurricane .PERIOD and  we  predicted  what  would  happen .PERIOD and  we  got  it  all  wrong .PERIOD and  the  reason  was  because  of  overfishing .PERIOD and  the  fact  that  a  last  common  grazer ,COMMA a  sea  urchin ,COMMA died .PERIOD and  within  a  few  months  after  that  sea  urchin  dying ,COMMA the  seaweed  started  to  grow .PERIOD and  that  is  the  same  reef .PERIOD that  's  the  same  reef  15  years  ago .PERIOD that  's  the  same  reef  today .PERIOD the  coral  reefs  of  the  north  coast  of  jamaica  have  a  few  percent  live  coral  cover  and  a  lot  of  seaweed  and  slime .PERIOD and  that  's  more  or  less  the  story  of  the  coral  reefs  of  the  caribbean ,COMMA and  increasingly ,COMMA tragically ,COMMA the  coral  reefs  worldwide .PERIOD now ,COMMA that  's  my  little ,COMMA depressing  story .PERIOD all  of  us  in  our  60s  and  70s  have  comparable  depressing  stories .PERIOD there  are  tens  of  thousands  of  those  stories  out  there .PERIOD and  it  's  really  hard  to  conjure  up  much  of  a  sense  of  well-being ,COMMA because  it  just  keeps  getting  worse .PERIOD and  the  reason  it  keeps  getting  worse  is  that  after  a  natural  catastrophe ,COMMA like  a  hurricane ,COMMA some  kind  of  successional  sequence  of  recovery ,COMMA but  what  's  going  on  now  is  that  overfishing  and  pollution  and  climate  change  are  all  interacting  in  a  way  that  prevents  that .PERIOD and  so  i  'm  going  to  sort  of  go  through  and  talk  about  those  three  kinds  of  things .PERIOD we  hear  a  lot  about  the  collapse  of  cod .PERIOD it  's  difficult  to  imagine  that  two ,COMMA or  some  historians  would  say  three  world  wars  were  fought  during  the  colonial  era  for  the  control  of  cod .PERIOD cod  fed  most  of  the  people  of  western  europe .PERIOD it  fed  the  slaves  brought  to  the  antilles .PERIOD the  song  jamaica  farewell ,COMMA ackee  rice  salt  fish  are  nice ,COMMA is  an  emblem  of  the  importance  of  salt  cod  from  northeastern  canada .PERIOD it  all  collapsed  in  the  80s  and  the  90s: .PERIOD 35,000  people  lost  their  jobs .PERIOD and  that  was  the  beginning  of  a  kind  of  serial  depletion .PERIOD from  bigger  and  tastier  species  to  smaller  and  not-so-tasty  species ,COMMA from  species  that  were  near  to  home  to  species  that  were  all  around  the  world .PERIOD and  what  have  you .PERIOD it  's  a  little  hard  to  understand  that ,COMMA because  you  can  go  to  a  costco  in  the  united  states  and  buy  cheap  fish .PERIOD you  ought  to  read  the  label  to  find  out  where  it  came  from ,COMMA but  it  's  still  cheap ,COMMA and  everybody  thinks  it  's  okay .PERIOD it  's  hard  to  communicate  this .PERIOD and  one  way  that  i  think  is  really  interesting  is  to  talk  about  sport  fish ,COMMA because  people  like  to  go  out  and  catch  fish .PERIOD it  's  one  of  those  things .PERIOD this  picture  here  shows  the  trophy  fish ,COMMA the  biggest  fish  caught  by  people  who  pay  a  lot  of  money  to  get  on  a  boat ,COMMA go  to  a  place  off  of  key  west  in  florida ,COMMA drink  a  lot  of  beer ,COMMA throw  a  lot  of  hooks  and  lines  into  the  water ,COMMA come  back  with  the  biggest  and  the  best  fish ,COMMA and  the  champion  trophy  fish  are  put  on  this  board ,COMMA where  people  take  a  picture ,COMMA and  this  guy  is  obviously  really  excited  about  that  fish .PERIOD well ,COMMA that  's  what  it  's  like  now ,COMMA but  this  is  what  it  was  like  in  the  1950s  from  the  same  boat  in  the  same  place  on  the  same  board  on  the  same  dock .PERIOD the  trophy  fish  were  so  big  that  you  could  n't  put  any  of  those  small  fish  up  on  it .PERIOD and  the  average  size  trophy  fish  weighed  250  to  300  pounds ,COMMA goliath  grouper ,COMMA and  if  you  wanted  to  go  out  and  kill  something ,COMMA you  could  pretty  much  count  on  being  able  to  catch  one  of  those  fish .PERIOD and  they  tasted  really  good .PERIOD and  people  paid  less  in  1950  dollars  to  catch  that  than  what  people  pay  now  to  catch  those  little ,COMMA tiny  fish .PERIOD and  that  's  everywhere .PERIOD it  's  not  just  the  fish ,COMMA though ,COMMA that  are  disappearing .PERIOD industrial  fishing  uses  big  stuff ,COMMA big  machinery .PERIOD we  use  nets  that  are  20  miles  long .PERIOD we  use  longlines  that  have  one  million  or  two  million  hooks .PERIOD and  we  trawl ,COMMA which  means  to  take  something  the  size  of  a  tractor  trailer  truck  that  weighs  thousands  and  thousands  of  pounds ,COMMA put  it  on  a  big  chain ,COMMA and  drag  it  across  the  sea  floor  to  stir  up  the  bottom  and  catch  the  fish .PERIOD think  of  it  as  being  kind  of  the  bulldozing  of  a  city  or  of  a  forest ,COMMA because  it  clears  it  away .PERIOD and  the  habitat  destruction  is  unbelievable .PERIOD this  is  a  photograph ,COMMA a  typical  photograph ,COMMA of  what  the  continental  shelves  of  the  world  look  like .PERIOD you  can  see  the  rows  in  the  bottom ,COMMA the  way  you  can  see  the  rows  in  a  field  that  has  just  been  plowed  to  plant  corn .PERIOD what  that  was ,COMMA was  a  forest  of  sponges  and  coral ,COMMA which  is  a  critical  habitat  for  the  development  of  fish .PERIOD what  it  is  now  is  mud .PERIOD and  the  area  of  the  ocean  floor  that  has  been  transformed  from  forest  to  level  mud ,COMMA to  parking  lot ,COMMA is  equivalent  to  the  entire  area  of  all  the  forests  that  have  ever  been  cut  down  on  all  of  the  earth  in  the  history  of  humanity .PERIOD we've  managed  to  do  that  in  the  last  100  to  150  years .PERIOD we  tend  to  think  of  oil  spills  and  mercury  and  we  hear  a  lot  about  plastic  these  days .PERIOD and  all  of  that  stuff  is  really  disgusting ,COMMA but  what  's  really  insidious  is  the  biological  pollution  that  happens  because  of  the  magnitude  of  the  shifts  that  it  causes  to  entire  ecosystems .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  just  talk  very  briefly  about  two  kinds  of  biological  pollution: .PERIOD one  is  introduced  species  and  the  other  is  what  comes  from  nutrients .PERIOD so  this  is  the  infamous  caulerpa  taxifolia ,COMMA the  so-called  killer  algae .PERIOD a  book  was  written  about  it .PERIOD it  's  a  bit  of  an  embarrassment .PERIOD it  was  accidentally  released  from  the  aquarium  in  monaco .PERIOD it  was  bred  to  be  cold  tolerant  to  have  in  peoples  aquaria .PERIOD it  's  very  pretty ,COMMA and  it  has  rapidly  started  to  overgrow  the  once  very  rich  biodiversity  of  the  northwestern  mediterranean .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  how  many  of  you  remember  the  movie  the  little  shop  of  horrors ,COMMA but  this  is  the  plant  of  the  little  shop  of  horrors .PERIOD but ,COMMA instead  of  devouring  the  people  in  the  shop ,COMMA what  it  's  doing  is  overgrowing  and  smothering  virtually  all  of  the  bottom-dwelling  life  of  the  entire  northwestern  mediterranean  sea .PERIOD we  do  n't  know  anything  that  eats  it .PERIOD we  're  trying  to  do  all  sorts  of  genetics  and  figure  out  something  that  could  be  done ,COMMA but ,COMMA as  it  stands ,COMMA it  's  the  monster  from  hell ,COMMA about  which  nobody  knows  what  to  do .PERIOD now  another  form  of  pollution  that  's  biological  pollution  is  what  happens  from  excess  nutrients .PERIOD the  green  revolution ,COMMA all  of  this  artificial  nitrogen  fertilizer ,COMMA we  use  too  much  of  it .PERIOD it  's  subsidized ,COMMA which  is  one  of  the  reasons  we  used  too  much  of  it .PERIOD it  runs  down  the  rivers ,COMMA and  it  feeds  the  plankton ,COMMA the  little  microscopic  plant  cells  in  the  coastal  water .PERIOD but  since  we  ate  all  the  oysters  and  we  ate  all  the  fish  that  would  eat  the  plankton ,COMMA there  's  nothing  to  eat  the  plankton .PERIOD and  there  's  more  and  more  of  it ,COMMA so  it  dies  of  old  age ,COMMA which  is  unheard  of  for  plankton .PERIOD and  when  it  dies ,COMMA it  falls  to  the  bottom  and  then  it  rots ,COMMA which  means  that  bacteria  break  it  down .PERIOD and  in  the  process  they  use  up  all  the  oxygen .PERIOD and  in  using  up  all  the  oxygen  they  make  the  environment  utterly  lethal  for  anything  that  cannot  swim  away .PERIOD so ,COMMA what  we  end  up  with  is  a  microbial  zoo  dominated  by  bacteria  and  jellyfish ,COMMA as  you  see  on  the  left  in  front  of  you .PERIOD and  the  only  fishery  left ,COMMA and  it  is  a  commercial  fishery ,COMMA is  the  jellyfish  fishery  you  see  on  the  right ,COMMA where  there  used  to  be  prawns .PERIOD even  in  newfoundland  where  we  used  to  catch  cod ,COMMA we  now  have  a  jellyfish  fishery .PERIOD and  another  version  of  this  sort  of  thing  is  what  is  often  called  red  tides  or  toxic  blooms .PERIOD that  picture  on  the  left  is  just  staggering  to  me .PERIOD i  have  talked  about  it  a  million  times ,COMMA but  it  's  unbelievable .PERIOD in  the  upper  right  of  that  picture  on  the  left  is  almost  the  mississippi  delta ,COMMA and  the  lower  left  of  that  picture  is  the  texas-mexico  border .PERIOD you  're  looking  at  the  entire  northwestern  gulf  of  mexico .PERIOD you  're  looking  at  one  toxic  dinoflagellate  bloom  that  can  kill  fish ,COMMA made  by  that  beautiful  little  creature  on  the  lower  right .PERIOD and  in  the  upper  right  you  see  this  black  sort  of  cloud  moving  ashore .PERIOD that  's  the  same  species .PERIOD and  as  it  comes  to  shore  and  the  wind  blows ,COMMA and  little  droplets  of  the  water  get  into  the  air ,COMMA the  emergency  rooms  of  all  the  hospitals  fill  up  with  people  with  acute  respiratory  distress .PERIOD and  that  's  retirement  homes  on  the  west  coast  of  florida .PERIOD a  friend  and  i  did  this  thing  in  hollywood  we  called  hollywood  ocean  night .PERIOD and  i  was  trying  to  figure  out  how  to  explain  to  actors  what  's  going  on .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA so ,COMMA imagine  you  're  in  a  movie  called  escape  from  malibu' .PERIOD because  all  the  beautiful  people  have  moved  to  north  dakota ,COMMA where  it  's  clean  and  safe .PERIOD and  the  only  people  who  are  left  there  are  the  people  who  cannot  afford  to  move  away  from  the  coast ,COMMA because  the  coast ,COMMA instead  of  being  paradise ,COMMA is  harmful  to  your  health .PERIOD and  then  this  is  amazing .PERIOD it  was  when  i  was  on  holiday  last  early  autumn  in  france .PERIOD this  is  from  the  coast  of  brittany ,COMMA which  is  being  enveloped  in  this  green ,COMMA algal  slime .PERIOD the  reason  that  it  attracted  so  much  attention ,COMMA besides  the  fact  that  it  's  disgusting ,COMMA is  that  sea  birds  flying  over  it  are  asphyxiated  by  the  smell  and  die ,COMMA and  a  farmer  died  of  it ,COMMA and  you  can  imagine  the  scandal  that  happened .PERIOD and  so  there  's  this  war  between  the  farmers  and  the  fishermen  about  it  all .PERIOD and  the  net  result  is  that  the  beaches  of  brittany  have  to  be  bulldozed  of  this  stuff  and  then ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA there  's  climate  change ,COMMA and  we  all  know  about  climate  change .PERIOD i  guess  the  iconic  figure  of  it  is  the  melting  of  the  ice  in  the  arctic  sea .PERIOD think  about  the  thousands  and  thousands  of  people  who  died  trying  to  find  the  northwest  passage .PERIOD well ,COMMA the  northwest  passage  is  already  there .PERIOD i  think  it  's  sort  of  funny .PERIOD it  's  on  the  siberian  coast .PERIOD maybe  the  russians  will  charge  tolls .PERIOD the  governments  of  the  world  are  taking  this  really  seriously .PERIOD the  military  of  the  arctic  nations  is  taking  it  really  seriously .PERIOD for  all  the  denial  of  climate  change  by  government  leaders ,COMMA the  cia .PERIOD and  the  navies  of  norway  and  the  us .PERIOD and  canada ,COMMA whatever  are  busily  thinking  about  how  they  will  secure  their  territory  in  this  inevitability  from  their  point  of  view .PERIOD and ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA arctic  communities  are  toast .PERIOD the  other  kinds  of  effects  of  climate  change ,COMMA this  is  coral  bleaching .PERIOD it  's  a  beautiful  picture ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK all  that  white  coral .PERIOD except  it  's  supposed  to  be  brown .PERIOD what  happens  is  that  the  corals  are  a  symbiosis ,COMMA and  they  have  these  little  algal  cells  that  live  inside  them .PERIOD and  the  algae  give  the  corals  sugar ,COMMA and  the  corals  give  the  algae  nutrients  and  protection .PERIOD but  when  it  gets  too  hot ,COMMA the  algae  cannot  make  the  sugar .PERIOD the  corals  say ,COMMA you  cheated .PERIOD you  did  n't  pay  your  rent .PERIOD they  kick  them  out ,COMMA and  then  they  die .PERIOD not  all  of  them  die .PERIOD some  of  them  survive .PERIOD some  more  are  surviving ,COMMA but  it  's  really  bad  news .PERIOD to  try  and  give  you  a  sense  of  this ,COMMA imagine  you  go  camping  in  july  somewhere  in  europe  or  in  north  america ,COMMA and  you  wake  up  the  next  morning ,COMMA and  you  look  around  you ,COMMA and  you  see  that  80  percent  of  the  trees ,COMMA as  far  as  you  can  see ,COMMA have  dropped  their  leaves  and  are  standing  there  naked .PERIOD and  you  come  home ,COMMA and  you  discover  that  80  percent  of  all  the  trees  in  north  america  and  in  europe  have  dropped  their  leaves .PERIOD and  then  you  read  in  the  paper  a  few  weeks  later ,COMMA oh ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA a  quarter  of  those  died .PERIOD well ,COMMA that  's  what  happened  in  the  indian  ocean  during  the  1998  el  nino ,COMMA an  area  vastly  greater  than  the  size  of  north  america  and  europe ,COMMA when  80  percent  of  all  the  corals  bleached  and  a  quarter  of  them  died .PERIOD and  then  the  really  scary  thing  about  all  of  this ,COMMA the  overfishing ,COMMA the  pollution  and  the  climate  change ,COMMA is  that  each  thing  does  n't  happen  in  a  vacuum .PERIOD but  there  are  these ,COMMA what  we  call ,COMMA positive  feedbacks .PERIOD the  synergies  among  them  that  make  the  whole  vastly  greater  than  the  sum  of  the  parts .PERIOD and  the  great  scientific  challenge  for  people  like  me  in  thinking  about  all  this ,COMMA is  do  we  know  how  to  put  humpty  dumpty  back  together  again ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA because  we ,COMMA at  this  point ,COMMA we  can  protect  it .PERIOD but  what  does  that  mean ?QUESTIONMARK we  really  do  n't  know .PERIOD so  what  are  the  oceans  going  to  be  like  in  20  or  50  years ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA there  wo  n't  be  any  fish  except  for  minnows ,COMMA and  the  water  will  be  pretty  dirty ,COMMA and  all  those  kinds  of  things  and  full  of  mercury ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD and  dead  zones  will  get  bigger  and  bigger  and  they  'll  start  to  merge .PERIOD and  we  can  imagine  something  like  the  dead-zonification  of  the  global ,COMMA coastal  ocean .PERIOD then  you  sure  wo  n't  want  to  eat  fish  that  were  raised  in  it ,COMMA because  it  would  be  a  kind  of  gastronomic  russian  roulette .PERIOD sometimes  you  have  a  toxic  bloom .PERIOD sometimes  you  do  n't .PERIOD that  does  n't  sell .PERIOD the  really  scary  things  though  are  the  physical ,COMMA chemical ,COMMA oceanographic  things  that  are  happening .PERIOD as  the  surface  of  the  ocean  gets  warmer ,COMMA the  water  is  lighter  when  it  's  warmer ,COMMA it  becomes  harder  and  harder  to  turn  the  ocean  over .PERIOD we  say  it  becomes  more  strongly  stratified .PERIOD the  consequence  of  that  is  that  all  those  nutrients  that  fuel  the  great  anchoveta  fisheries ,COMMA of  the  sardines  of  california  or  in  peru  or  whatever ,COMMA those  slow  down  and  those  fisheries  collapse .PERIOD and ,COMMA at  the  same  time ,COMMA water  from  the  surface ,COMMA which  is  rich  in  oxygen ,COMMA does  n't  make  it  down  and  the  ocean  turns  into  a  desert .PERIOD so  the  question  is ,COMMA how  are  we  all  going  to  respond  to  this ?QUESTIONMARK and  we  can  do  all  sorts  of  things  to  fix  it ,COMMA but  in  the  final  analysis ,COMMA the  thing  we  really  need  to  fix  is  ourselves .PERIOD it  's  not  about  the  fish .PERIOD it  's  not  about  the  pollution .PERIOD it  's  not  about  the  climate  change .PERIOD it  's  about  us  and  our  greed  and  our  need  for  growth  and  our  inability  to  imagine  a  world  that  is  different  from  the  selfish  world  we  live  in  today .PERIOD so  the  question  is ,COMMA will  we  respond  to  this  or  not ?QUESTIONMARK i  would  say  that  the  future  of  life  and  the  dignity  of  human  beings  depends  on  our  doing  that .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  talk  about  your  mindset .PERIOD does  your  mindset  correspond  to  my  dataset ?QUESTIONMARK if  not ,COMMA one  or  the  other  needs  upgrading ,COMMA is  n't  it ?QUESTIONMARK when  i  talk  to  my  students  about  global  issues ,COMMA and  i  listen  to  them  in  the  coffee  break ,COMMA they  always  talk  about  we  and  them .PERIOD and  when  they  come  back  into  the  lecture  room  i  ask  them ,COMMA what  do  you  mean  with  we  and  them ?QUESTIONMARK oh ,COMMA it  's  very  easy .PERIOD it  's  the  western  world  and  it  's  the  developing  world ,COMMA they  say .PERIOD we  learned  it  in  college  and  what  is  the  definition  then ?QUESTIONMARK the  definition ?QUESTIONMARK everyone  knows ,COMMA they  say .PERIOD but  then  you  know ,COMMA i  press  them  like  this .PERIOD so  one  girl  said ,COMMA very  cleverly ,COMMA it  's  very  easy .PERIOD western  world  is  a  long  life  in  a  small  family .PERIOD developing  world  is  a  short  life  in  a  large  family  and  i  like  that  definition ,COMMA because  it  enabled  me  to  transfer  their  mindset  into  the  dataset .PERIOD and  here  you  have  the  dataset .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  can  see  that  what  we  have  on  this  axis  here  is  size  of  family .PERIOD one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three ,COMMA four ,COMMA five  children  per  woman  on  this  axis .PERIOD and  here ,COMMA length  of  life ,COMMA life  expectancy ,COMMA 30 ,COMMA 40 ,COMMA 50 .PERIOD exactly  what  the  students  said  was  their  concept  about  the  world .PERIOD and  really  this  is  about  the  bedroom .PERIOD whether  the  man  and  woman  decide  to  have  small  family ,COMMA and  take  care  of  their  kids ,COMMA and  how  long  they  will  live .PERIOD it  's  about  the  bathroom  and  the  kitchen .PERIOD if  you  have  soap ,COMMA water  and  food ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  can  live  long .PERIOD and  the  students  were  right .PERIOD it  was  n't  that  the  world  consisted ,COMMA the  world  consisted  here ,COMMA of  one  set  of  countries  over  here ,COMMA which  had  large  families  and  short  life .PERIOD developing  world .PERIOD and  we  had  one  set  of  countries  up  there  which  was  the  western  world .PERIOD they  had  small  families  and  long  life .PERIOD and  you  are  going  to  see  here  the  amazing  thing  that  has  happened  in  the  world  during  my  lifetime .PERIOD then  the  developing  countries  applied  soap  and  water ,COMMA vaccination .PERIOD and  all  the  developing  world  started  to  apply  family  planning .PERIOD and  partly  to  usa  who  help  to  provide  technical  advice  and  investment .PERIOD and  you  see  all  the  world  moves  over  to  a  two  child  family ,COMMA and  a  life  with  60  to  70  years .PERIOD but  some  countries  remain  back  in  this  area  here .PERIOD and  you  can  see  we  still  have  afghanistan  down  here .PERIOD we  have  liberia .PERIOD we  have  congo .PERIOD so  we  have  countries  living  there .PERIOD so  the  problem  i  had  is  that  the  worldview  that  my  students  had  corresponds  to  reality  in  the  world  the  year  their  teachers  were  born .PERIOD and  we ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA when  we  have  played  this  over  the  world .PERIOD i  was  at  the  global  health  conference  here  in  washington  last  week ,COMMA and  i  could  see  the  wrong  concept  even  active  people  in  united  states  had .PERIOD that  they  did  n't  realize  the  improvement  of  mexico  there ,COMMA and  china ,COMMA in  relation  to  united  states .PERIOD look  here  when  i  move  them  forward .PERIOD here  we  go .PERIOD they  catch  up .PERIOD there  's  mexico .PERIOD it  's  on  par  with  united  states  in  these  two  social  dimensions .PERIOD there  was  less  than  five  percent  of  the  specialists  in  global  health  that  was  aware  of  this .PERIOD this  great  nation ,COMMA mexico ,COMMA has  the  problem  that  arms  are  coming  from  north ,COMMA across  the  borders ,COMMA so  they  had  to  stop  that .PERIOD because  they  have  this  strange  relationship  to  the  united  states ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD but  if  i  would  change  this  axis  here ,COMMA i  would  instead  put  income  per  person .PERIOD income  per  person .PERIOD i  can  put  that  here .PERIOD and  we  will  then  see  a  completely  different  picture .PERIOD by  the  way ,COMMA i  'm  teaching  you  how  to  use  our  website ,COMMA gapminder  world ,COMMA while  i  'm  correcting  this ,COMMA because  this  is  a  free  utility  on  the  net .PERIOD and  when  i  now  finally  got  it  right ,COMMA i  can  go  back  200  years  in  history .PERIOD and  i  can  find  united  states  up  there .PERIOD and  i  can  let  the  other  countries  be  shown .PERIOD and  now  i  have  income  per  person  on  this  axis .PERIOD and  united  states  only  had  some ,COMMA one ,COMMA two  thousand  dollars  at  that  time .PERIOD and  the  life  expectancy  was  35  to  40  years ,COMMA on  par  with  afghanistan  today .PERIOD and  what  has  happened  in  the  world ,COMMA i  will  show  now .PERIOD this  is  instead  of  studying  history  for  one  year  at  university .PERIOD you  can  watch  me  for  one  minute  now  and  you  'll  see  the  whole  thing .PERIOD you  can  see  how  the  brown  bubbles ,COMMA which  is  west  europe ,COMMA and  the  yellow  one ,COMMA which  is  the  united  states ,COMMA they  get  richer  and  richer  and  also  start  to  get  healthier  and  healthier .PERIOD and  this  is  now  100  years  ago ,COMMA where  the  rest  of  the  world  remains  behind .PERIOD here  we  come .PERIOD and  that  was  the  influenza .PERIOD that  's  why  we  are  so  scared  about  flu ,COMMA is  n't  it ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  still  remembered .PERIOD the  fall  of  life  expectancy .PERIOD and  then  we  come  up .PERIOD not  until  independence  started .PERIOD look  here  you  have  china  over  there ,COMMA you  have  india  over  there ,COMMA and  this  is  what  has  happened .PERIOD did  you  note  there ,COMMA that  we  have  mexico  up  there ?QUESTIONMARK mexico  is  not  at  all  on  par  with  the  united  states .PERIOD but  they  are  quite  close .PERIOD and  especially ,COMMA it  's  interesting  to  see  china  and  the  united  states  during  200  years .PERIOD because  i  have  my  oldest  son  now  working  for  google ,COMMA after  google  acquired  this  software .PERIOD because  in  fact ,COMMA this  is  child  labor .PERIOD my  son  and  his  wife  sat  in  a  closet  for  many  years  and  developed  this .PERIOD and  my  youngest  son ,COMMA who  studied  chinese  in  beijing .PERIOD so  they  come  in  with  the  two  perspectives  i  have ,COMMA you  know ?QUESTIONMARK and  my  son ,COMMA youngest  son  who  studied  in  beijing ,COMMA in  china ,COMMA he  got  a  long-term  perspective .PERIOD whereas  when  my  oldest  son ,COMMA who  works  for  google ,COMMA he  should  develop  by  quarter ,COMMA or  by  half-year .PERIOD or  google  is  quite  generous ,COMMA so  he  can  have  one  or  two  years  to  go .PERIOD but  in  china  they  look  generation  after  generation  because  they  remember  the  very  embarrassing  period ,COMMA for  100  years ,COMMA when  they  went  backwards .PERIOD and  then  they  would  remember  the  first  part  of  last  century ,COMMA which  was  really  bad .PERIOD and  we  could  go  by  this  so-called  great  leap  forward .PERIOD but  this  was  1963 .PERIOD mao  tse-tung  eventually  brought  health  to  china .PERIOD and  then  he  died ,COMMA and  then  deng  xiaoping  started  this  amazing  move  forward .PERIOD is  n't  it  strange  to  see  that  the  united  states  first  grew  the  economy ,COMMA and  then  gradually  got  rich ?QUESTIONMARK whereas  china  could  get  healthy  much  earlier .PERIOD because  they  applied  the  knowledge  of  education ,COMMA nutrition ,COMMA and  then  also  benefits  of  penicillin  and  vaccines  and  family  planning .PERIOD and  asia  could  have  social  development  before  they  got  the  economic  development .PERIOD so  to  me ,COMMA as  a  public  health  professor ,COMMA it  's  not  strange  that  all  these  countries  grow  so  fast  now .PERIOD because  what  you  see  here ,COMMA what  you  see  here  is  the  flat  world  of  thomas  friedman .PERIOD is  n't  it .PERIOD it  's  not  really ,COMMA really  flat .PERIOD but  the  middle  income  countries ,COMMA and  this  is  where  i  suggest  to  my  students ,COMMA stop  using  the  concept  developing  world  because  after  all ,COMMA talking  about  the  developing  world  is  like  having  two  chapters  in  the  history  of  the  united  states .PERIOD the  last  chapter  is  about  present ,COMMA and  president  obama .PERIOD and  the  other  is  about  the  past ,COMMA where  you  cover  everything  from  washington  to  eisenhower .PERIOD because  washington  to  eisenhower ,COMMA that  is  what  we  find  in  the  developing  world .PERIOD we  could  actually  go  to  mayflower  to  eisenhower ,COMMA and  that  would  be  put  together  into  a  developing  world .PERIOD which  is  rightly  growing  its  cities  in  a  very  amazing  way .PERIOD which  have  great  entrepreneurs ,COMMA but  also  have  the  collapsing  countries .PERIOD so ,COMMA how  could  we  make  better  sense  about  this ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA one  way  of  trying  is  to  see  whether  we  could  look  at  income  distribution .PERIOD this  is  the  income  distribution  of  peoples  in  the  world ,COMMA from  $1 .PERIOD this  is  where  you  have  food  to  eat .PERIOD these  people  go  to  bed  hungry .PERIOD and  this  is  the  number  of  people .PERIOD this  is  $10 ,COMMA whether  you  have  a  public  or  a  private  health  service  system .PERIOD this  is  where  you  can  provide  health  service  for  your  family  and  school  for  your  children .PERIOD and  this  is  oecd  countries: .PERIOD green ,COMMA latin  america ,COMMA east  europe .PERIOD this  is  east  asia ,COMMA and  the  light  blue  there  is  south  asia .PERIOD and  this  is  how  the  world  changed .PERIOD it  changed  like  this .PERIOD can  you  see  how  it  's  growing ?QUESTIONMARK and  how  hundreds  of  millions  and  billions  is  coming  out  of  poverty  in  asia ?QUESTIONMARK and  it  goes  over  here ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  come  now ,COMMA into  projections .PERIOD but  i  have  to  stop  at  the  door  of  lehman  brothers  there ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA because ,COMMA that  's  where  the  projections  are  not  valid  any  longer .PERIOD probably  the  world  will  do  this .PERIOD and  then  it  will  continue  forward  like  this .PERIOD but  more  or  less ,COMMA this  is  what  will  happen .PERIOD and  we  have  a  world  which  cannot  be  looked  upon  as  divided .PERIOD we  have  the  high  income  countries  here ,COMMA with  the  united  states  as  a  leading  power .PERIOD we  have  the  emerging  economies  in  the  middle ,COMMA which  provide  a  lot  of  the  funding  for  the  bailout .PERIOD and  we  have  the  low  income  countries  here .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA this  is  a  fact  that  from  where  the  money  comes .PERIOD they  have  been  saving ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA over  the  last  decade .PERIOD and  here  we  have  the  low  income  countries  where  entrepreneurs  are .PERIOD and  here  we  have  the  countries  in  collapse  and  war ,COMMA like  afghanistan ,COMMA somalia ,COMMA parts  of  congo ,COMMA darfur .PERIOD we  have  all  this  at  the  same  time .PERIOD that  's  why  it  's  so  problematic  to  describe  what  has  happened  in  the  developing  world .PERIOD because  it  's  so  different ,COMMA what  has  happened  there .PERIOD and  that  's  why  i  suggest  a  slightly  different  approach  of  what  you  would  call  it .PERIOD and  you  have  huge  differences  within  countries  also .PERIOD i  heard  that  your  departments  here  were  by  regions .PERIOD here  you  have  sub-saharan  africa ,COMMA south  asia ,COMMA east  asia ,COMMA arab  states ,COMMA east  europe ,COMMA latin  america ,COMMA and  oecd .PERIOD and  on  this  axis ,COMMA gdp .PERIOD and  on  this ,COMMA heath ,COMMA child  survival .PERIOD and  it  does  n't  come  as  a  surprise  that  africa  south  of  sahara  is  at  the  bottom .PERIOD but  when  i  split  it ,COMMA when  i  split  it  into  country  bubbles ,COMMA the  size  of  the  bubbles  here  is  the  population .PERIOD then  you  see  sierra  leone  and  mauritius ,COMMA completely  different .PERIOD there  is  such  a  difference  within  sub-saharan  africa .PERIOD and  i  can  split  the  others .PERIOD here  is  the  south  asian ,COMMA arab  world .PERIOD now  all  your  different  departments .PERIOD east  europe ,COMMA latin  america ,COMMA and  oecd  countries .PERIOD and  here  were  are .PERIOD we  have  a  continuum  in  the  world .PERIOD we  cannot  put  it  into  two  parts .PERIOD it  is  mayflower  down  here .PERIOD it  is  washington  here ,COMMA building ,COMMA building  countries .PERIOD it  's  lincoln  here ,COMMA advancing  them .PERIOD it  's  eisenhower  bringing  modernity  into  the  countries .PERIOD and  then  it  's  united  states  today ,COMMA up  here .PERIOD and  we  have  countries  all  this  way .PERIOD now ,COMMA this  is  the  important  thing  of  understanding  how  the  world  has  changed .PERIOD at  this  point  i  decided  to  make  a  pause .PERIOD and  it  is  my  task ,COMMA on  behalf  of  the  rest  of  the  world ,COMMA to  convey  a  thanks  to  the  us .PERIOD taxpayers ,COMMA for  demographic  health  survey .PERIOD many  are  not  aware  of ,COMMA no ,COMMA this  is  not  a  joke .PERIOD this  is  very  serious .PERIOD it  is  due  to  usa  's  continuous  sponsoring  during  25  years  of  the  very  good  methodology  for  measuring  child  mortality  that  we  have  a  grasp  of  what  's  happening  in  the  world .PERIOD and  it  is  us .PERIOD government  at  its  best ,COMMA without  advocacy ,COMMA providing  facts ,COMMA that  it  's  useful  for  the  society .PERIOD and  providing  data  free  of  charge  on  the  internet ,COMMA for  the  world  to  use .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD quite  the  opposite  of  the  world  bank ,COMMA who  compiled  data  with  government  money ,COMMA tax  money ,COMMA and  then  they  sell  it  to  add  a  little  profit ,COMMA in  a  very  inefficient ,COMMA gutenberg  way .PERIOD but  the  people  doing  that  at  the  world  bank  are  among  the  best  in  the  world .PERIOD and  they  are  highly  skilled  professionals .PERIOD it  's  just  that  we  would  like  to  upgrade  our

show  you  what  happens  with  the  data ,COMMA what  we  can  show  with  this  data .PERIOD look  here .PERIOD this  is  the  world .PERIOD with  income  down  there  and  child  mortality .PERIOD

.PERIOD we  have  a  continuum .PERIOD but  we  still  have ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA congo ,COMMA up  there .PERIOD we  still  have  as  poor  countries  as  we  have  had ,COMMA always ,COMMA in

,COMMA mdg  4 .PERIOD the  united  states  has  not  been  so  eager  to  use  mdg  4 .PERIOD but  you  have  been  the  main  sponsor  that  has  enabled  us  to  measure  it .PERIOD because  it  's

do  this  kind  of  stuff  it  's  like  doing  eva .PERIOD it  's  like  doing  extra-vehicular  activity  in  space ,COMMA but  at  much  greater  distances ,COMMA and  at  much  greater  physical

?QUESTIONMARK the  government  recently  announced  plans  to  return  to  the  moon  by  2024 .PERIOD the  successful  conclusion  of  that  mission  will  result  in  infrequent  visitation  of  the

,COMMA you  're  going  to  burn  a  billion  dollars  in  fuel  alone  sending  a  crew  out  there .PERIOD but  if  you  send  a  mining  team  there ,COMMA without  the  return  propellant ,COMMA

greenest  ceo  in  five  years  -- .PERIOD that ,COMMA frankly ,COMMA was  a  pretty  sad  commentary  on  american  ceos  in  1999 .PERIOD asked  later  in  the  canadian  documentary ,COMMA the  corporation ,COMMA what  i  meant  by  the  go  to  jail  remark ,COMMA i  offered  that  theft  is  a  crime .PERIOD and  theft  of  our  children  's  future  would  someday  be  a  crime .PERIOD but  i  realized ,COMMA for  that  to  be  true ,COMMA for  theft  of  our  children  's  future  to  be  a  crime ,COMMA there  must  be  a  clear ,COMMA demonstrable  alternative  to  the  take-make-waste  industrial  system  that  so  dominates  our  civilization ,COMMA and  is  the  major  culprit ,COMMA stealing  our  children  's  future ,COMMA by  digging  up  the  earth  and  converting  it  to  products  that  quickly  become  waste  in  a  landfill  or  an  incinerator  -- .PERIOD in  short ,COMMA digging  up  the  earth  and  converting  it  to  pollution .PERIOD according  to  paul  and  anne  ehrlich  and  a  well-known  environmental  impact  equation ,COMMA impact ,COMMA a  bad  thing ,COMMA is  the  product  of  population ,COMMA affluence  and  technology .PERIOD that  is ,COMMA impact  is  generated  by  people ,COMMA what  they  consume  in  their  affluence ,COMMA and  how  it  is  produced .PERIOD and  though  the  equation  is  largely  subjective ,COMMA you  can  perhaps  quantify  people ,COMMA and  perhaps  quantify  affluence ,COMMA but  technology  is  abusive  in  too  many  ways  to  quantify .PERIOD so  the  equation  is  conceptual .PERIOD still  it  works  to  help  us  understand  the  problem .PERIOD so  we  set  out  at  interface ,COMMA in  1994 ,COMMA to  create  an  example ,COMMA to  transform  the  way  we  made  carpet .PERIOD a  petroleum-intensive  product  for  materials  as  well  as  energy .PERIOD and  to  transform  our  technologies  so  they  diminished  environmental  impact ,COMMA rather  than  multiplied  it .PERIOD paul  and  anne  ehrlich  's  environmental  impact  equation ,COMMA i  is  equal  to  p  times  a  times  t: .PERIOD population ,COMMA affluence  and  technology .PERIOD i  wanted  interface  to  rewrite  that  equation  so  that  it  read  i  equals  p  times  a  divided  by  t .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  mathematically-minded  will  see  immediately  that  t  in  the  numerator  increases  impact ,COMMA a  bad  thing  -- .PERIOD but  t  in  the  denominator  decreases  impact .PERIOD so  i  ask ,COMMA what  would  move  t ,COMMA technology ,COMMA from  the  numerator ,COMMA call  it  t1 ,COMMA where  it  increases  impact ,COMMA to  the  denominator ,COMMA call  it  t2 ,COMMA where  it  reduces  impact ?QUESTIONMARK i  thought  about  the  characteristics  of  first  industrial  revolution ,COMMA t1 ,COMMA as  we  practiced  it  at  interface ,COMMA and  it  had  the  following  characteristics .PERIOD extractive ,COMMA taking  raw  materials  from  the  earth .PERIOD linear ,COMMA take ,COMMA make ,COMMA waste .PERIOD powered  by  fossil  fuel-derived  energy .PERIOD wasteful ,COMMA abusive  and  focused  on  labor  productivity .PERIOD more  carpet  per  man-hour .PERIOD thinking  it  through ,COMMA i  realized  that  all  those  attributes  must  be  changed  to  move  t  to  the  denominator .PERIOD in  the  new  industrial  revolution  extractive  must  be  replaced  by  renewable .PERIOD linear  by  cyclical .PERIOD fossil  fuel  energy  by  renewable  energy ,COMMA sunlight .PERIOD wasteful  by  waste-free .PERIOD and  abusive  by  benign .PERIOD and  labor  productivity  by  resource  productivity .PERIOD and  i  reasoned  that  if  we  could  make  those  transformative  changes ,COMMA and  get  rid  of  t1  altogether ,COMMA we  could  reduce  our  impact  to  zero ,COMMA including  our  impact  on  the  climate .PERIOD and  that  became  the  interface  plan  in  1995 .PERIOD and  has  been  the  plan  ever  since .PERIOD we  have  measured  our  progress  very  rigorously .PERIOD so  i  can  tell  you  how  far  we  have  come  in  the  ensuing  12  years .PERIOD net  greenhouse  gas  emissions  down  82  percent  in  absolute  tonnage .PERIOD over  the  same  span  of  time  sales  have  increased  by  two-thirds  and  profits  have  doubled .PERIOD so  an  82  percent  absolute  reduction  translates  into  a  90  percent  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  intensity  relative  to  sales .PERIOD this  is  the  magnitude  of  the  reduction  the  entire  global  technosphere

,COMMA of  course ,COMMA the  economic  meltdown .PERIOD it  actually  got  so  bad  that  somebody  put  our  country  up  for  sale  on  ebay .PERIOD ninety-nine  pence  was  the  starting  price

.PERIOD i  'm  here  to  tell  you  the  story  of  audur  capital ,COMMA which  is  a  financial  firm  founded  by  me  and  kristin ,COMMA who  you  see  in  the  picture ,COMMA in  the  spring  of  2007 ,COMMA just  over  a  year  before  the  economic  collapse  hit .PERIOD why  would  two  women  who  were  enjoying  successful  careers  in  investment  banking  in  the  corporate  sector  leave  to  found  a  financial  services  firm ?QUESTIONMARK well  let  it  suffice  to  say  that  we  felt  a  bit  overwhelmed  with  testosterone .PERIOD and  i  'm  not  here  to  say  that  men  are  to  blame  for  the  crisis  and  what  happened  in  my  country .PERIOD but  i  can  surely  tell  you  that  in  my  country ,COMMA much  like  on  wall  street  and  the  city  of  london  and  elsewhere ,COMMA men  were  at  the  helm  of  the  game  of  the  financial  sector .PERIOD and  that  kind  of  lack  of  diversity  and  sameness  leads  to  disastrous  problems .PERIOD so  we  decided ,COMMA a  bit  fed-up  with  this  world  and  also  with  the  strong  feeling  in  our  stomach  that  this  was  n't  sustainable ,COMMA to  found  a  financial  services  firm  based  on  our  values .PERIOD and  we  decided  to  incorporate  feminine  values  into  the  world  of  finance .PERIOD raised  quite  a  few  eyebrows  in  iceland .PERIOD we  were  n't  known  as  the  typical  women  women  in  iceland  up  until  then .PERIOD so  it  was  almost  like  coming  out  of  the  closet  to  actually  talk  about  the  fact  that  we  were  women  and  that  we  believed  that  we  had  a  set  of  values  and  a  way  of  doing  business  that  would  be  more  sustainable  than  what  we  had  experienced  until  then .PERIOD and  we  got  a  great  group  of  people  to  join  us ,COMMA principled  people  with  great  skills ,COMMA and  investors  with  a  vision  and  values  to  match  ours .PERIOD and  together  we  got  through  the  eye  of  the  financial  storm  in  iceland  without  taking  any  direct  losses  to  our  equity  or  to  the  funds  of  our  clients .PERIOD and  although  i  want  to  thank  the  talented  people  of  our  company  foremost  for  that ,COMMA and  also  there  's  a  factor  of  luck  and  timing ,COMMA we  are  absolutely  convinced  that  we  did  this  because  of  our  values .PERIOD so  let  me  share  with  you  our  values .PERIOD we  believe  in  risk  awareness .PERIOD what  does  that  mean ?QUESTIONMARK we  believe  that  you  should  always  understand  the  risks  that  you  're  taking ,COMMA and  we  will  not  invest  in  things  we  do  n't  understand .PERIOD not  a  complicated  thing .PERIOD but  in  2007 ,COMMA at  the  height  of  the  sub-prime  and  all  the  complicated  financial  structures ,COMMA it  was  quite  opposite  to  the  reckless  risk-taking  behaviors  that  we  saw  on  the  market .PERIOD we  also  believe  in  straight-talking ,COMMA telling  it  as  it  is ,COMMA using  simple  language  that  people  understand ,COMMA telling  people  about  the  downsides  as  well  as  the  potential  upsides ,COMMA and  even  telling  the  bad  news  that  no  one  wants  to  utter ,COMMA like  our  lack  of  belief  in  the  sustainability  of  the  icelandic  financial  sector  that  already  we  had  months  before  the  collapse  hit  us .PERIOD and ,COMMA although  we  do  work  in  the  financial  sector ,COMMA where  excel  is  king ,COMMA we  believe  in  emotional  capital .PERIOD and  we  believe  that  doing  emotional  due  diligence  is  just  as  important  as  doing  financial  due  diligence .PERIOD it  is  actually  people  that  make  money  and  lose  money ,COMMA not  excel  spreadsheets .PERIOD last ,COMMA but  not  least ,COMMA we  believe  in  profit  with  principles .PERIOD we  care  how  we  make  our  profit .PERIOD so  while  we  want  to  make  economic  profit  for  ourselves  and  our  customers ,COMMA we  are  willing  to  do  it  with  a  long-term  view .PERIOD and  we  like  to  have  a  wider  definition  of  profits  than  just  the  economic  profit  in  the  next  quarter .PERIOD so  we  like  to  see  profits ,COMMA plus  positive  social  and  environmental  benefits ,COMMA when  we  invest .PERIOD but  it  was  n't  just  about  the  values ,COMMA although  we  are  convinced  that  they  matter .PERIOD it  was  also  about  a  business  opportunity .PERIOD it  's  the  female  trend ,COMMA and  it  's  the  sustainability  trend ,COMMA that  are  going  to  create  some  of  the  most  interesting  investment  opportunities  in  the  years  to  come .PERIOD the  whole  thing  about  the  female  trend  is  not  about  women  being  better  than  men .PERIOD it  is  actually  about  women  being  different  from  men ,COMMA bringing  different  values  and  different  ways  to  the  table .PERIOD so  what  do  you  get ?QUESTIONMARK you  get  better  decision-making .PERIOD and  you  get  less  herd  behavior .PERIOD and  both  of  those  things  hit  your  bottom  line  with  very  positive  results .PERIOD but  one  has  to  wonder ,COMMA now  that  we've  had  this  financial  sector  collapse  upon  us  in  iceland ,COMMA and  by  the  way ,COMMA europe  looks  pretty  bad  right  now .PERIOD and  many  would  say  that  you  in  america  are  heading  for  some  more  trouble  as  well .PERIOD now  that  we've  had  all  that  happen ,COMMA and  we  have  all  this  data  out  there  telling  us  that  it  's  much  better  to  have  diversity  around  the  decision-making  tables ,COMMA will  we  see  business  and  finance  change ?QUESTIONMARK will  government  change ?QUESTIONMARK well  i  'll  give  you  my  straight  talk  about  this .PERIOD i  have  days  that  i  believe ,COMMA but  i  have  days  that  i  'm  full  of  doubt .PERIOD have  you  seen  the  incredible  urge  out  there  to  rebuild  the

outcome .PERIOD so  i  guess  the  world  is  insane ,COMMA because  i  see  entirely  too  much  of  doing  the  same  things  over  and  over  again ,COMMA hoping  that  this  time  it  's  not  going  to  collapse  upon  us .PERIOD i  want  to  see  more  revolutionary  thinking .PERIOD and  i  remain  hopeful .PERIOD like  ted ,COMMA i  believe  in  people .PERIOD and  i  know  that  consumers  are  becoming  more  conscious ,COMMA and  they  are  going  to  start  voting  with  their  wallets ,COMMA and  they  are  going  to  change  the  face  of  business  and  finance  from  the  outside ,COMMA if  they  do  n't  do  it  from  the  inside .PERIOD but  i  'm  more  of  the  revolutionary ,COMMA and  i  should  be .PERIOD i  'm  from  iceland .PERIOD we  have  a  long  history  of  strong ,COMMA courageous ,COMMA independent  women ,COMMA ever  since  the  viking  age .PERIOD and  i  want  to  tell  you  when  i  first  realized  that  women  matter  to  the

,COMMA she  was  a  woman ,COMMA and  even  half  a  woman .PERIOD that  night  she  won  the  election ,COMMA because  she  came  back ,COMMA not  just  because  of  his  crappy  behavior ,COMMA but  she  came  back  and  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA i  'm  actually  not  going  to  breastfeed  the  icelandic  nation .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  lead  it .PERIOD so  i've  had  incredibly  many  women

we  create  and  sustain  life .PERIOD so  we  should  embrace  our  difference  and  aim  for  challenge .PERIOD the  final  thought  i  want  to  leave  with  you  is  that  i  'm  fed  up  with

supposed  to  be  the  smallest  genome  of  a  self-replicating  species ,COMMA could  there  be  even  a  smaller  genome ?QUESTIONMARK could  we  understand  the  basis  of  cellular  life  at  the  genetic  level ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  been  a  15-year  quest  just  to  get  to  the  starting  point  now  to  be  able  to  answer  those  questions .PERIOD because  it  's  very  difficult  to  eliminate  multiple  genes  from  a  cell .PERIOD you  can  only  do  them  one  at  a  time .PERIOD we  decided  early  on  that  we  had  to  take  a  synthetic  route ,COMMA even  though  nobody  had  been  there  before ,COMMA to  see  if  we  could  synthesize  a  bacterial  chromosome  so  we  could  actually  vary  the  gene  content  to  understand  the  essential  genes  for  life .PERIOD that  started  our  15-year  quest  to  get  here .PERIOD but  before  we  did  the  first  experiments ,COMMA we  actually  asked  art  caplan  's  team  at  the  university  of  pennsylvania  to  undertake  a  review  of  what  the  risks ,COMMA the  challenges ,COMMA the  ethics  around  creating  new  species  in  the  laboratory  were  because  it  had  n't  been  done  before .PERIOD they  spent  about  two  years  reviewing  that  independently  and  published  their  results  in  science  in  1999 .PERIOD ham  and  i  took  two  years  off  as  a  side  project  to  sequence  the  human  genome ,COMMA but  as  soon  as  that  was  done  we  got  back  to  the  task  at  hand .PERIOD in  2002 ,COMMA we  started  a  new  institute ,COMMA the  institute  for  biological  energy  alternatives ,COMMA where  we  set  out  two  goals: .PERIOD one ,COMMA to  understand  the  impact  of  our  technology  on  the  environment ,COMMA and  how  to  understand  the  environment  better .PERIOD and  two ,COMMA to  start  down  this  process  of  making  synthetic  life  to  understand  basic  life .PERIOD in  2003 ,COMMA we  published  our  first  success .PERIOD so  ham  smith  and  clyde  hutchison  developed  some  new  methods  for  making  error-free  dna  at  a  small  level .PERIOD our  first  task  was  a  5,000-letter  code  bacteriophage ,COMMA a  virus  that  attacks  only  e .PERIOD coli .PERIOD so  that  was  the  phage  phi  x  174 ,COMMA which  was  chosen  for  historical  reasons .PERIOD it  was  the  first  dna  phage ,COMMA dna  virus ,COMMA dna  genome  that  was  actually  sequenced .PERIOD so  once  we  realized  that  we  could  make  5,000-base  pair  viral-sized  pieces ,COMMA we  thought ,COMMA we  at  least  have  the  means  then  to  try  and  make  serially  lots  of  these  pieces  to  be  able  to  eventually  assemble  them  together  to  make  this  mega  base  chromosome .PERIOD so ,COMMA substantially  larger  than  we  even  thought  we  would  go  initially .PERIOD there  were  several  steps  to  this .PERIOD there  were  two  sides: .PERIOD we  had  to  solve  the  chemistry  for  making  large  dna  molecules ,COMMA and  we  had  to  solve  the  biological  side  of  how ,COMMA if  we  had  this  new  chemical  entity ,COMMA how  would  we  boot  it  up ,COMMA activate  it  in  a  recipient  cell .PERIOD we  had  two  teams  working  in  parallel ,COMMA one  team  on  the  chemistry ,COMMA and  the  other  on  trying  to  entire  chromosomes  to  get  new  cells .PERIOD when  we  started  this  out ,COMMA we  thought  the  synthesis  would  be  the  biggest  problem ,COMMA which  is  why  we  chose  the  smallest  genome .PERIOD and  some  of  you  have  noticed  that  we  switched  from  the  smallest  genome  to  a  much  larger  one .PERIOD and  we  can  walk  through  the  reasons  for  that ,COMMA but  basically  the  small  cell  took  on  the  order  of  one  to  two  months  to  get  results  from ,COMMA whereas  the  larger ,COMMA faster-growing  cell  takes  only  two  days .PERIOD so  there  's  only  so  many  cycles  we  could  go  through  in  a  year  at  six  weeks  per  cycle .PERIOD and  you  should  know  that  basically  99 ,COMMA probably  99  percent  plus  of  our  experiments  failed .PERIOD so  this  was  a  debugging ,COMMA problem-solving  scenario  from  the  beginning  because  there  was  no  recipe  of  how  to  get  there .PERIOD so ,COMMA one  of  the  most  important  publications  we  had  was  in  2007 .PERIOD carole  lartigue  led  the  effort  to  actually  transplant  a  bacterial  chromosome  from  one  bacteria  to  another .PERIOD i  think  philosophically ,COMMA that  was  one  of  the  most  important  papers  that  we've  ever  done  because  it  showed  how  dynamic  life  was .PERIOD and  we  knew ,COMMA once  that  worked ,COMMA that  we  actually  had  a  chance  if  we  could  make  the  synthetic  chromosomes  to  do  the  same  with  those .PERIOD we  did  n't  know  that  it  was  going  to  take  us  several  years  more  to  get  there .PERIOD in  2008 ,COMMA we  reported  the  complete  synthesis  of  the  mycoplasma  genitalium  genome ,COMMA a  little  over  500,000  letters  of  genetic  code ,COMMA but  we  have  not  yet  succeeded  in  booting  up  that  chromosome .PERIOD we  think  in  part ,COMMA because  of  its  slow  growth  and ,COMMA in  part ,COMMA cells  have  all  kinds  of  unique  defense  mechanisms  to  keep  these  events  from  happening .PERIOD it  turned  out  the  cell  that  we  were  trying  to  transplant  into  had  a  nuclease ,COMMA an  enzyme  that  chews  up  dna  on  its  surface ,COMMA and  was  happy  to  eat  the  synthetic  dna  that  we  gave  it  and  never  got  transplantations .PERIOD but  at  the  time ,COMMA that  was  the  largest  molecule  of  a  defined  structure  that  had  been  made .PERIOD and  so  both  sides  were  progressing ,COMMA but  part  of  the  synthesis  had  to  be  accomplished  or  was  able  to  be  accomplished  using  yeast ,COMMA putting  the  fragments  in  yeast  and  yeast  would  assemble  these  for  us .PERIOD it  's  an  amazing  step  forward ,COMMA but  we  had  a  problem  because  now  we  had  the  bacterial  chromosomes  growing  in  yeast .PERIOD so  in  addition  to  doing  the  transplant ,COMMA we  had  to  find  out  how  to  get  a  bacterial  chromosome  out  of  the  eukaryotic  yeast  into  a  form  where  we  could  transplant  it  into  a  recipient  cell .PERIOD so  our  team  developed  new  techniques  for  actually  growing ,COMMA cloning  entire  bacterial  chromosomes  in  yeast .PERIOD so  we  took  the  same  mycoides  genome  that  carole  had  initially  transplanted ,COMMA and  we  grew  that  in  yeast  as  an  artificial  chromosome .PERIOD and  we  thought  this  would  be  a  great  test  bed  for  learning  how  to  get  chromosomes  out  of  yeast  and  transplant  them .PERIOD when  we  did  these  experiments ,COMMA though ,COMMA we  could  get  the  chromosome  out  of  yeast  but  it  would  n't  transplant  and  boot  up  a  cell .PERIOD that  little  issue  took  the  team  two  years  to  solve .PERIOD it  turns  out ,COMMA the  dna  in  the  bacterial  cell  was  actually  methylated ,COMMA and  the  methylation  protects  it  from  the  restriction  enzyme ,COMMA from  digesting  the  dna .PERIOD so  what  we  found  is  if  we  took  the  chromosome  out  of  yeast  and  methylated  it ,COMMA we  could  then  transplant  it .PERIOD further  advances  came  when  the  team  removed  the  restriction  enzyme  genes  from  the  recipient  capricolum  cell .PERIOD and  once  we  had  done  that ,COMMA now  we  can  take  naked  dna  out  of  yeast  and  transplant  it .PERIOD so  last  fall  when  we  published  the  results  of  that  work  in  science ,COMMA we  all  became  overconfident  and  were  sure  we  were  only  a  few  weeks  away  from  being  able  to  now  boot  up  a  chromosome  out  of  yeast .PERIOD because  of  the  problems  with  mycoplasma  genitalium  and  its  slow  growth  about  a  year  and  a  half  ago ,COMMA we  decided  to  synthesize  the  much  larger  chromosome ,COMMA the  mycoides  chromosome ,COMMA knowing  that  we  had  the  biology  worked  out  on  that  for  transplantation .PERIOD and  dan  led  the  team  for  the  synthesis  of  this  over  one-million-base  pair  chromosome .PERIOD but  it  turned  out  it  was  n't  going  to  be  as  simple  in  the  end .PERIOD and  it  set  us  back  three  months  because  we  had  one  error  out  of  over  a  million  base  pairs  in  that  sequence .PERIOD so  the  team  developed  new  debugging  software ,COMMA where  we  could  test  each  synthetic  fragment  to  see  if  it  would  grow  in  a  background  of  wild  type  dna .PERIOD and  we  found  that  10  out  of  the  11  100,000-base  pair  pieces  we  synthesized  were  completely  accurate  and  compatible  with  a  life-forming  sequence .PERIOD we  narrowed  it  down  to  one  fragment .PERIOD we  sequenced  it  and  found  just  one  base  pair  had  been  deleted  in  an  essential  gene .PERIOD so  accuracy  is  essential .PERIOD there  's  parts  of  the  genome  where  it  cannot  tolerate  even  a  single  error ,COMMA and  then  there  's  parts  of  the  genome  where  we  can  put  in  large  blocks  of  dna ,COMMA as  we  did  with  the  watermarks ,COMMA and  it  can  tolerate  all  kinds  of  errors .PERIOD so  it  took  about  three  months  to  find  that  error  and  repair  it .PERIOD and  then  early  one  morning ,COMMA at  6  am .PERIOD we  got  a  text  from  dan  saying  that ,COMMA now ,COMMA the  first  blue  colonies  existed .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  's  been  a  long  route  to  get  here ,COMMA 15  years  from  the  beginning .PERIOD we  felt  one  of  the  tenets  of  this  field  was  to  make  absolutely  certain  we  could  distinguish  synthetic  dna  from  natural  dna .PERIOD early  on ,COMMA when  you  're  working  in  a  new  area  of  science ,COMMA you  have  to  think  about  all  the  pitfalls  and  things  that  could  lead  you  to  believe  that  you  had  done  something  when  you  had  n't ,COMMA and ,COMMA even  worse ,COMMA leading  others  to  believe  it .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  thought  the  worst  problem  would  be  a  single  molecule  contamination  of  the  native  chromosome ,COMMA leading  us  to  believe  that  we  actually  had  created  a  synthetic  cell ,COMMA when  it  would  have  been  just  a  contaminant .PERIOD so  early  on ,COMMA we  developed  the  notion  of  putting  in  watermarks  in  the  dna  to  absolutely  make  clear  that  the  dna  was  synthetic .PERIOD and  the  first  chromosome  we  built  in  2008 ,COMMA the  500,000-base  pair  one ,COMMA we  simply  assigned  the  names  of  the  authors  of  the  chromosome  into  the  genetic  code .PERIOD but  it  was  using  just  amino  acid  single  letter  translations ,COMMA which  leaves  out  certain  letters  of  the  alphabet .PERIOD so  the  team  actually  developed  a  new  code  within  the  code  within  the  code .PERIOD so  it  's  a  new  code  for  interpreting  and  writing  messages  in  dna .PERIOD now ,COMMA mathematicians  have  been  hiding  and  writing  messages  in  the  genetic  code  for  a  long  time ,COMMA but  it  's  clear  they  were  mathematicians  and  not  biologists  because ,COMMA if  you  write  long  messages  with  the  code  that  the  mathematicians  developed ,COMMA it  would  more  than  likely  lead  to  new  proteins  being  synthesized  with  unknown  functions .PERIOD so  the  code  that  mike  montague  and  the  team  developed  actually  puts  frequent  stop  codons .PERIOD so  it  's  a  different  alphabet  but  allows  us  to  use  the  entire  english  alphabet  with  punctuation  and  numbers .PERIOD so ,COMMA there  are  four  major  watermarks  all  over  1,000  base  pairs  of  genetic  code .PERIOD the  first  one  actually  contains  within  it  this  code  for  interpreting  the  rest  of  the  genetic  code .PERIOD so  in  the  remaining  information ,COMMA in  the  watermarks ,COMMA contain  the  names  of ,COMMA i  think  it  's  46  different  authors  and  key  contributors  to  getting  the  project  to  this  stage .PERIOD and  we  also  built  in  a  website  address  so  that  if  somebody  decodes  the  code  within  the  code  within  the  code ,COMMA they  can  send  an  email  to  that  address .PERIOD so  it  's  clearly  distinguishable  from  any  other  species ,COMMA having  46  names  in  it ,COMMA its  own  web  address .PERIOD and  we  added  three  quotations ,COMMA because  with  the  first  genome  we  were  criticized  for  not  trying  to  say  something  more  profound  than  just  signing  the  work .PERIOD so  we  wo  n't  give  the  rest  of  the  code ,COMMA but  we  will  give  the  three  quotations .PERIOD the  first  is ,COMMA to  live ,COMMA to  err ,COMMA to  fall ,COMMA to  triumph  and  to  recreate  life  out  of  life .PERIOD it  's  a  james  joyce  quote .PERIOD the  second  quotation  is ,COMMA see  things  not  as  they  are ,COMMA but  as  they  might  be .PERIOD it  's  a  quote  from  the  american  prometheus  book  on  robert  oppenheimer .PERIOD and  the  last  one  is  a  richard  feynman  quote: .PERIOD what  i  cannot  build ,COMMA i  cannot  understand .PERIOD so ,COMMA because  this  is  as  much  a  philosophical  advance  as  a  technical  advance  in  science ,COMMA we  tried  to  deal  with  both  the  philosophical  and  the  technical  side .PERIOD the  last  thing  i  want  to  say  before  turning  it  over  to  questions  is  that  the  extensive  work  that  we've  done ,COMMA asking  for  ethical  review ,COMMA pushing  the  envelope  on  that  side  as  well  as  the  technical  side ,COMMA this  has  been  broadly  discussed  in  the  scientific  community ,COMMA in  the  policy  community  and  at  the  highest  levels  of  the  federal  government .PERIOD even  with  this  announcement ,COMMA as  we  did  in  2003 ,COMMA that  work  was  funded  by  the  department  of  energy ,COMMA so  the  work  was  reviewed  at  the  level  of  the  white  house ,COMMA trying  to  decide  whether  to  classify  the  work  or  publish  it .PERIOD and  they  came  down  on  the  side  of  open  publication ,COMMA which  is  the  right  approach  -- .PERIOD we've  briefed  the  white  house .PERIOD we've  briefed  members  of  congress ,COMMA we've  tried  to  take  and  push  the  policy  issues  in  parallel  with  the  scientific  advances .PERIOD so  with  that ,COMMA i  would  like  to  open  it  first  to  the  floor  for  questions .PERIOD yes ,COMMA in  the  back .PERIOD reporter ,COMMA could  you  explain ,COMMA in  layman  's  terms ,COMMA how  significant  a  breakthrough  this  is  please ?QUESTIONMARK craig  venter ,COMMA can  we  explain  how  significant  this  is ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  not  sure  we  're  the  ones  that  should  be  explaining  how  significant  it  is .PERIOD it  's  significant  to  us .PERIOD perhaps  it  's  a  giant  philosophical  change  in  how  we  view  life .PERIOD we  actually  view  it  as  a  baby  step  in  terms  of ,COMMA it  's  taken  us  15  years  to  be  able  to  do  the  experiment  we  wanted  to  do  15  years  ago  on  understanding  life  at  its  basic  level .PERIOD but  we  actually  believe  this  is  going  to  be  a  very  powerful  set  of  tools .PERIOD and  we  're  already  starting  in  numerous  avenues  to  use  this  tool .PERIOD we  have ,COMMA at  the  institute ,COMMA ongoing  funding  now  from  nih  in  a  program  with  novartis  to  try  and  use  these  new  synthetic  dna  tools  to  perhaps  make  the  flu  vaccine  that  you  might  get  next  year .PERIOD because  instead  of  taking  weeks  to  months  to  make  these ,COMMA dan  's  team  can  now  make  these  in  less  than  24  hours .PERIOD so  when  you  see  how  long  it  took  to  get  an  h1n1  vaccine  out ,COMMA we  think  we  can  shorten  that  process  quite  substantially .PERIOD in  the  vaccine  area ,COMMA synthetic  genomics  and  the  institute  are  forming  a  new  vaccine  company  because  we  think  these  tools  can  affect  vaccines  to  diseases  that  have  n't  been  possible  to  date ,COMMA things  where  the  viruses  rapidly  evolve ,COMMA such  with  rhinovirus .PERIOD would  n't  it  be  nice  to  have  something  that  actually  blocked  common  colds ?QUESTIONMARK or ,COMMA more  importantly ,COMMA hiv ,COMMA where  the  virus  evolves  so  quickly  the  vaccines  that  are  made  today  cannot  keep  up  with  those  evolutionary  changes .PERIOD also ,COMMA at  synthetic  genomics ,COMMA we've  been  working  on  major  environmental  issues .PERIOD i  think  this  latest  oil  spill  in  the  gulf  is  a  reminder .PERIOD we  cannot  see  co2 ,COMMA we  depend  on  scientific  measurements  for  it  and  we  see  the  beginning  results  of  having  too  much  of  it  -- .PERIOD but  we  can  see  pre-co2  now  floating  on  the  waters  and  contaminating  the  beaches  in  the  gulf .PERIOD we  need  some  alternatives  for  oil .PERIOD we  have  a  program  with  exxon  mobile  to  try  and  develop  new  strains  of  algae  that  can  efficiently  capture  carbon  dioxide  from  the  atmosphere  or  from  concentrated  sources ,COMMA make  new  hydrocarbons  that  can  go  into  their  refineries  to  make  normal  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel  out  of  co2 .PERIOD those  are  just  a  couple  of  the  approaches  and  directions  that  we  're  taking .PERIOD i  have ,COMMA like ,COMMA a  thing  about  sleeping .PERIOD i  do  n't  sleep  that  much ,COMMA and  i've  come  to  this  thing  about ,COMMA like ,COMMA not  sleeping  much  as  being  a  great  virtue ,COMMA after  years  of  kind  of  battling  it  as  being  a  terrible  detriment ,COMMA or  something .PERIOD and  now  i  really  like  sort  of  sitting  up ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD but  for  years  i've  been  sitting  up  and  i  think  that ,COMMA like ,COMMA my  creativity  is  greatly  motivated  by  this  kind  of  insomnia .PERIOD i  lie  awake .PERIOD i  think  thoughts .PERIOD i  walk  aimlessly .PERIOD sometimes  i  used  to  walk  more  at  night .PERIOD i  walk  during  the  day  and  i  follow  people  who  i  think  look  interesting .PERIOD and  sometimes ,COMMA actually ,COMMA once  it  was  on  page  six  in  the  post ,COMMA that  i  was  cruising  this  guy ,COMMA like ,COMMA sort  of ,COMMA whatever ,COMMA but  i  was  actually  just  following  because  he  had  these  really  great  shoes  on .PERIOD and  so  i  was  following  this  guy .PERIOD and  i  took  a  picture  of  his  shoes ,COMMA and  we  thanked  each  other  and  just  went  on  our  way .PERIOD but  i  do  that  all  the  time .PERIOD as  a  matter  of  fact ,COMMA i  think  a  lot  of  my  design  ideas  come  from  mistakes  and  tricks  of  the  eye .PERIOD because  i  feel  like ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA there  are  so  many  images  out  there ,COMMA so  many  clothes  out  there .PERIOD and  the  only  ones  that  look  interesting  to  me  are  the  ones  that  look  slightly  mistaken ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA or  very ,COMMA very  surprising .PERIOD and  often ,COMMA i  'm  driving  in  a  taxi  and  i  see  a  hole  in  a  shirt ,COMMA or  something  that  looks  very  interesting  or  pretty  or  functional  in  some  way  that  i'd  never  seen  happen  before .PERIOD and  so  i'd  make  the  car  stop ,COMMA and  i'd  get  out  of  the  car  and  walk ,COMMA and  see  that  in  fact  there  was  n't  a  hole ,COMMA but  it  was  a  trick  of  my  eye ,COMMA it  was  a  shadow ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD or  if  there  was  a  hole  i'd  think  like ,COMMA oh  damn ,COMMA there  was  actually  someone  thought  of  that  thought  already .PERIOD someone  made  that  mistake  already  so  i  cannot  do  it  anymore .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  where  inspiration  comes  from .PERIOD it  does  not  come  for  me  from  research .PERIOD i  do  n't  get  necessarily  inspired  by  research .PERIOD as  a  matter  of  fact ,COMMA one  of  the  most  fun  things  i've  ever ,COMMA ever  done  in  my  whole  life ,COMMA was  this  christmas  season  at  the  guggenheim  in  new  york .PERIOD i  read  peter  and  the  wolf  with  this  beautiful  band  from  juilliard .PERIOD and  i  did  like ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA the  narrator ,COMMA and  i  read  it .PERIOD and  i  saw  this  really  smart  critic  who  i  love .PERIOD this  woman ,COMMA joan  acocella ,COMMA who  's  a  friend  of  mine ,COMMA and  she  came  backstage  and  she  said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA isaac ,COMMA did  you  know  that ,COMMA talking  about  stalinism  and  talking  about ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA like  the  30s  in  russia .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA how  do  i  know  about  stalinism ?QUESTIONMARK i  know  about  a  wolf  and  a  bird  and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA he  ate  the  bird ,COMMA and  then  in  the  end  you  hear ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  hear  the  bird  squeaking ,COMMA or  something ,COMMA you  know ?QUESTIONMARK so  i  do  n't  really  know  that .PERIOD i  do  n't  really ,COMMA actually  i  do  my  own  kind  of  research ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD if  i  'm  commissioned  to  do  the  costumes  for  an  18th-century  opera ,COMMA or  something  like  that ,COMMA i  will  do  a  lot  of  research ,COMMA because  it  's  interesting ,COMMA not  because  it  's  what  i  'm  supposed  to  do .PERIOD i  'm  very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very  inspired  by  movies .PERIOD the  color  of  movies  and  the  way  light  makes  the  colors ,COMMA light  from  behind  the  projection ,COMMA or  light  from  the  projection ,COMMA makes  the  colors  look  so  impossible .PERIOD and  anyway ,COMMA roll  this  little  clip ,COMMA i  'll  just  show  you .PERIOD i  sit  up  at  night  and  i  watch  movies  and  i  watch  women  in  movies  a  lot .PERIOD and  i  think  about ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA their  roles ,COMMA and  about  how  you  have  to ,COMMA like ,COMMA watch  what  your  daughters  look  at .PERIOD because  i  look  at  the  way  women  are  portrayed  all  the  time .PERIOD whether  they  're  kind  of  glorified  in  this  way ,COMMA or  whether  they  're  kind  of ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA ironically  glorified .PERIOD or  whether  they  're ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA sort  of  denigrated ,COMMA or  ironically  denigrated .PERIOD i  go  back  to  color  all  the  time .PERIOD color  is  something  that  motivates  me  a  lot .PERIOD it  's  rarely  color  that  i  find  in  nature ,COMMA although ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA juxtaposed  next  to  artificial  color ,COMMA natural  color  is  so  beautiful .PERIOD so  that  's  what  i  do .PERIOD i  study  color  a  lot .PERIOD but  for  the  most  part ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA like ,COMMA how  can  i  ever  make  anything  that  is  as  beautiful  as  that  image  of  natalie  wood ?QUESTIONMARK how  can  i  ever  make  anything  as  beautiful  as  greta  garbo ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA that  's  just  not  possible ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD and  so  that  's  what  makes  me  lie  awake  at  night ,COMMA i  guess ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD i  want  to  show  you ,COMMA i  'm  also  like  a  big ,COMMA i  go  to  astrologers  and  tarot  card  readers  often ,COMMA and  that  's  another  thing  that  motivates  me  a  lot .PERIOD people  say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA do  that .PERIOD an  astrologer  tells  me  to  do  something .PERIOD so  i  do  it .PERIOD when  i  was  about  21 ,COMMA an  astrologer  told  me  that  i  was  going  to  meet  the  man  of

whose  name  was  eric  i  was  humping  immediately ,COMMA or  something .PERIOD and  there  were  times  when  i  was  actually  so  desperate  i  would  just ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA walk  into  a  room  and  just  go  like ,COMMA eric .PERIOD and  anybody  who  would  turn  around  i  would ,COMMA sort  of ,COMMA make  a  beeline  for .PERIOD and  i  had  this  really  interesting  tarot  reading  a  long  time  ago .PERIOD the  last  card  he  pulled ,COMMA which  was  representing  my  destiny  was  this  guy  on  like  a  straw  boater  with  a  cane  and  you  know ,COMMA sort  of

.PERIOD so  actually ,COMMA check  this  out .PERIOD very  embarrassing .PERIOD  ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD we  can  do  anything  you  ask .PERIOD the  name  of  the  show  is  based  on  this  story

with  being  happy ,COMMA i  swear .PERIOD i  was  dating  this  guy  and  it  was  going  on  for  about  a  year ,COMMA right .PERIOD and  we  were  getting  serious ,COMMA so  we  decided  to  invite  them  all  to  dinner ,COMMA our  parents .PERIOD and  we ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA sort  of  introduced  them  to  each  other .PERIOD my  mother  was ,COMMA sort  of ,COMMA very  sensitive  to  his  mother ,COMMA who  it  seemed  was  a  little  bit  skeptical  about  the  whole  alternative  lifestyle  thing .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA homosexuality ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK so  my  mother  was  a  little  offended .PERIOD she  turned  to  her  and  she  said ,COMMA are  you  kidding ?QUESTIONMARK they  have  the  greatest  life  together .PERIOD they  eat  out ,COMMA they  see  shows .PERIOD they  eat  out ,COMMA they  see  shows .PERIOD that  's  the  name  of  the  show ,COMMA they  eat  out ,COMMA they ,COMMA that  's  on  my  tombstone  when  i  die .PERIOD he  ate  out ,COMMA he  saw  shows ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK so  in  editing  these  clips ,COMMA i  did  n't  have  the  audacity  to  edit  a  clip  of  me  singing  at  joe  's  pub .PERIOD so  you  'll  have  to ,COMMA like ,COMMA go  check  it  out  and  come  see  me  or  something .PERIOD because  it  's  mortifying ,COMMA and  yet  it  feels .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  how  to  put  this .PERIOD i  feel  as  little  comfort  as  possible  is  a  good  thing ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD and  at  least ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA in  my  case ,COMMA because  if  i  just  do  one  thing  all  the  time ,COMMA i  do  n't  know ,COMMA i  get  very ,COMMA very  bored .PERIOD i  bore  very  easily .PERIOD and  you  know ,COMMA i  do  n't  say  that  i  do  everything  well ,COMMA i  just  say  that  i  do  a  lot  of  things ,COMMA that  's  all .PERIOD and  i  kind  of  try  not  to  look  back ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD except ,COMMA i  guess ,COMMA that  's  what  staying  up  every  night  is  about .PERIOD like ,COMMA looking  back  and  thinking ,COMMA what  a  fool  you  made  of  yourself ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD but  i  guess  that  's  okay .PERIOD right ?QUESTIONMARK because  if  you  do  many  things  you  get  to  feel  lousy  about  everything ,COMMA and  not  just  one ,COMMA you  know .PERIOD you  do  n't  master  feeling  lousy  about  one  thing .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD i

dancers .PERIOD again ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  where  inspiration  comes  from .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  where  it  comes  from .PERIOD i  started  making  puppets  when  i  was  a  kid .PERIOD maybe  that  's  where  the  whole  inspiration  thing  started  from ,COMMA puppets ,COMMA right .PERIOD and  then  performing  arts  high  school .PERIOD there  i  was  in  high  school ,COMMA meeting  dancers  and  acting .PERIOD and  somehow ,COMMA from  there ,COMMA i  got  interested  in  design .PERIOD i  went  to  parsons  school  of  design  and  then  i  began  my  career  as  a  designer .PERIOD i  do  n't  really  think  of  myself  as  a  designer ,COMMA i  do  n't  really  think  of  myself  necessarily  as  a  fashion  designer .PERIOD and  frankly ,COMMA i  do  n't  really  know  what  to  call  myself .PERIOD i  think  of  myself  as  a .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  what  i  think  of  myself  as .PERIOD it  's  just  that .PERIOD but  i  must  say ,COMMA this  whole  thing  about  being  slightly  bored  all  the  time ,COMMA that  is  what ,COMMA i  think  that  is  a  very  important  thing  for  a  fashion  designer .PERIOD you  always  have  to  be  slightly  bored  with  everything .PERIOD and  if  you  're  not ,COMMA you  have  to  pretend  to  be  slightly  bored  with  everything .PERIOD but  i  am  really  a  little  bored  with  everything .PERIOD i  always  say  to  my  partner ,COMMA marisa  gardini ,COMMA who  books  everything ,COMMA she  books  everything  and  she  makes  everything  happen .PERIOD and  she  makes  all  the  deals .PERIOD and  i  always  tell  her  that  i  find  myself  with  a  lot  of  time  on  the  computer  bridge  program .PERIOD too  much  time  on  computer  bridge ,COMMA which  is ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA like  that  's  so .PERIOD somehow ,COMMA like ,COMMA about  ten  years  ago  i  thought  that  the  most  unboring  place  in  the  world  would  be  like  a  tv .PERIOD studio ,COMMA like  for  a  day  show .PERIOD some  kind  of  day  talk  show .PERIOD because  it  's  all  of  these  things  that  i  love  all  kind  of  in  one  place .PERIOD and  if  you  ever  get  bored  you  can  look  at  another  thing ,COMMA and  do  another  thing  and  talk  about  it ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and  so  i  had  this  tv .PERIOD show .PERIOD and  that  was  a  very ,COMMA very ,COMMA very  big  part  of  my  process .PERIOD actually ,COMMA could  you  roll  the  clip ,COMMA please ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  one  of  my  favorite  clips  of  rosie .PERIOD isaac  mizrahi ,COMMA we  're  back  on  the

,COMMA you  read  about  all  these  people  who  have  a  lot  of  money  and  they  have  kids  and  the  kids  always  end  up  somehow ,COMMA like ,COMMA really  messed  up ,COMMA you  know  what  i  mean ?QUESTIONMARK and  there  's  got  to  be  some  way  to  do  that ,COMMA rosie .PERIOD because  just  because  if  you  're  fabulously  rich ,COMMA and  fabulously  famous ,COMMA does  that  mean  you  should  n't  have  kids ,COMMA because  you  know  they  're  going  to  end  up  getting  messed  up ?QUESTIONMARK rod ,COMMA no ,COMMA but  it  means  that  your  priority  has  to  be  their  well-being  first ,COMMA i  think .PERIOD but  you  have  to  make  the  decision  for  yourself .PERIOD my  kids  are  seven ,COMMA who  the  hell  knows .PERIOD they  're  going  to  be  like

 like  it  needs  to  be  a  little  closer  down  here .PERIOD a ,COMMA oh  no ,COMMA we  're  just  staging ,COMMA rod ,COMMA we  're  just  staging  it .PERIOD im ,COMMA are  you  freaking  out

like  that .PERIOD that  is  not  boring .PERIOD that  is  nothing  if  it  's  not  boring .PERIOD actually ,COMMA i  read  this  great  quote  the  other  day ,COMMA which  was ,COMMA style  makes  you  feel  great  because  it  takes  your  mind  off  the  fact  that  you  're  going  to  die  right ?QUESTIONMARK and  then  i  realized ,COMMA that  was  on  my  website ,COMMA and  then  it  said ,COMMA like ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA the  quote  was  attributed  to  me  and  i  thought ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i  said  something ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA in  an  interview .PERIOD i  forgot  that  i  said  that .PERIOD but  it  's  really  true .PERIOD i  want  to  show  you  this  last  clip  because  it  's  going  to  be  my  last  goodbye .PERIOD i  'll  tell  you  that  i  cook  a  lot  also .PERIOD i  love  to  cook .PERIOD and  i  often  look  at  things  as  though  they  're  food .PERIOD like  i  say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA would  you  serve  a  rotten  chicken ?QUESTIONMARK then  how  could  you  serve ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA a  beat  up  old  dress  or  something .PERIOD how  could  you  show  a  beat  up  old  dress ?QUESTIONMARK i  always  relate  things  to  kitchen-ry .PERIOD and  so  i  think  that  's  what  it  all  boils  down  to .PERIOD everything  boils  down  to  that .PERIOD so  check  this  out .PERIOD this  is  what  i've  been  doing  because  i  think  it  's  the  most  fun  thing  in  the  world .PERIOD it  's ,COMMA like ,COMMA this  website .PERIOD it  's  got  a  lot  of  different  things  on  it .PERIOD it  's  a  polymathematical  website .PERIOD we  actually  shoot  segments  like  tv .PERIOD show  segments .PERIOD and  it  's  kind  of  my  favorite  thing  in  the  world .PERIOD and  it  just  began  like  in  the  beginning  of  february .PERIOD so  who  knows ?QUESTIONMARK and  again ,COMMA i  do  n't  say  it  's  good ,COMMA i  just  think  it  's  not  boring ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK and  here  is  the  last  bit .PERIOD im ,COMMA i  have  to  tell  you ,COMMA i  make  buttermilk  pancakes  or  buttermilk  waffles  all  the  time .PERIOD chef ,COMMA do  you ?QUESTIONMARK im ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA but  i  can  never  find  buttermilk ,COMMA ever .PERIOD chef ,COMMA oh .PERIOD im ,COMMA you  cannot  find  buttermilk  at  citarella .PERIOD you  cannot  find  buttermilk .PERIOD chef ,COMMA you  cannot ?QUESTIONMARK im ,COMMA it  's  always  low-fat  buttermilk .PERIOD chef ,COMMA no ,COMMA but  that  's  all  it  is .PERIOD im ,COMMA is  that  all  it  is ?QUESTIONMARK chef ,COMMA oh ,COMMA you  do  n't  know ?QUESTIONMARK let  me  tell  you  something .PERIOD let  me  tell  you  something  interesting .PERIOD im ,COMMA you  know  what ?QUESTIONMARK stop  laughing .PERIOD it  's  not  funny .PERIOD just  because  i  do  n't  know  that  whole ,COMMA that  there  's  no  such  thing  as  whole  buttermilk .PERIOD sorry ,COMMA what ?QUESTIONMARK chef ,COMMA well ,COMMA here  's  the  deal .PERIOD let  me  tell  you  the  deal .PERIOD in  the  old  days  when  they  used  to  make  butter ,COMMA you  know  how  you  make  butter ?QUESTIONMARK im ,COMMA churns ?QUESTIONMARK chef ,COMMA for  cream ?QUESTIONMARK im ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD chef ,COMMA so  you  take  heavy ,COMMA high-fat  milk ,COMMA which  is  cream ,COMMA and  you  churn  it  until  it  separates  into  these  curds  and  water .PERIOD the  liquid  is  actually  that  clear  liquid .PERIOD if  you've  ever  overbeaten  your  whipped  cream ,COMMA it  's  actually  buttermilk .PERIOD and  that  's  what  it  was  in  the  early  days .PERIOD and  that  's  what  people  used  for  baking  and  all  sorts  of  things .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  buttermilk  that  you  get  is  actually  low-fat  or  skim  milk .PERIOD im ,COMMA excuse  me ,COMMA i  did  n't  know .PERIOD all  right ?QUESTIONMARK chef ,COMMA the  reason  he  thought  that  is  because  buttermilk  is  so  wonderfully  thick  and  delicious .PERIOD im ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA it  is ,COMMA exactly .PERIOD so  who  would  think  that  it  was  low-fat ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA that  's  it .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD happy  ted .PERIOD it  's  so  wonderful  here .PERIOD i  love  it .PERIOD i  love  it .PERIOD i  love  it .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD bye .PERIOD i  heard  this  amazing  story  about  miuccia  prada .PERIOD she  's  an  italian  fashion  designer .PERIOD she  goes  to  this  vintage  store  in  paris  with  a  friend  of  hers .PERIOD she  's  rooting  around ,COMMA she  finds  this  one  jacket  by  balenciaga  -- .PERIOD she  loves  it .PERIOD she  's  turning  it  inside  out .PERIOD she  's  looking  at  the  seams .PERIOD she  's  looking  at  the  construction .PERIOD her  friend  says ,COMMA buy  it  already .PERIOD she  said ,COMMA i  'll  buy  it ,COMMA but  i  'm  also  going  to  replicate  it .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  academics  in  this  audience  may  think ,COMMA well ,COMMA that  sounds  like  plagiarism .PERIOD but  to  a  fashionista ,COMMA what  it  really  is  is  a  sign  of  prada  's  genius ,COMMA that  she  can  root  through  the  history  of  fashion  and  pick  the  one  jacket  that  does  n't  need  to  be  changed  by  one  iota ,COMMA and  to  be  current  and  to  be  now .PERIOD you  might  also  be  asking  whether  it  's  possible  that  this  is  illegal  for  her  to  do  this .PERIOD well ,COMMA it  turns  out  that  it  's  actually  not  illegal .PERIOD in  the  fashion  industry ,COMMA there  's  very  little  intellectual  property  protection .PERIOD they  have  trademark  protection ,COMMA but  no  copyright  protection  and  no  patent  protection  to  speak  of .PERIOD all  they  have ,COMMA really ,COMMA is  trademark  protection .PERIOD and  so  it  means  that  anybody  could  copy  any  garment  on  any  person  in  this  room  and  sell  it  as  their  own  design .PERIOD the  only  thing  that  they  cannot  copy  is  the  actual  trademark  label  within  that  piece  of  apparel .PERIOD that  's  one  reason  that  you  see  logos  splattered  all  over  these  products .PERIOD it  's  because  it  's  a  lot  harder  for  knock-off  artists  to  knock  off  these  designs  because  they  cannot  knock  off  the  logo .PERIOD but  if  you  go  to  santee  alley ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD well ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD canal  street ,COMMA i  know .PERIOD and  sometimes  these  are  fun ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA the  reason  for  this ,COMMA the  reason  that  the  fashion  industry  does  n't  have  any  copyright  protection  is  because  the  courts  decided  long  ago  that  apparel  is  too  utilitarian  to  qualify  for  copyright  protection .PERIOD they  did  n't  want  a  handful  of  designers  owning  the  seminal  building  blocks  of  our  clothing .PERIOD and  then  everybody  else  would  have  to  license  this  cuff  or  this  sleeve  because  joe  blow  owns  it .PERIOD but  too  utilitarian ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean  is  that  the  way  you  think  of  fashion ?QUESTIONMARK this  is  vivienne  westwood .PERIOD no .PERIOD we  think  of  it  as  maybe  too  silly ,COMMA too  unnecessary .PERIOD now ,COMMA those  of  you  who  are  familiar  with  the  logic  behind  copyright  protection ,COMMA which  is  that  without  ownership ,COMMA there  is  no  incentive  to  innovate ,COMMA might  be  really  surprised  by  both  the  critical  success  of  the  fashion  industry  and  the  economic  success  of  this  industry .PERIOD what  i  'm  going  to  argue  today  is  that  because  there  's  no  copyright  protection  in  the  fashion  industry ,COMMA fashion  designers  have  actually  been  able  to  elevate  utilitarian  design ,COMMA things  to  cover  our  naked  bodies ,COMMA into  something  that  we  consider  art .PERIOD because  there  's  no  copyright  protection  in  this  industry ,COMMA there  's  a  very  open  and  creative  ecology  of  creativity .PERIOD unlike  their  creative  brothers  and  sisters ,COMMA who  are  sculptors  or  photographers  or  filmmakers  or  musicians ,COMMA fashion  designers  can  sample  from  all  their  peers  designs .PERIOD they  can  take  any  element  from  any  garment  from  the  history  of  fashion  and  incorporate  it  into  their  own  design .PERIOD they  're  also  notorious  for  riffing  off  of  the  zeitgeist .PERIOD and  here ,COMMA i  suspect ,COMMA they  were  influenced  by  the  costumes  in  avatar .PERIOD maybe  just  a  little .PERIOD ca  n't  copyright  a  costume  either .PERIOD now ,COMMA fashion  designers  have  the  broadest  palette  imaginable  in  this  creative  industry .PERIOD this  wedding  dress  here  is  actually  made  of  sporks .PERIOD and  this  dress  is  actually  made  of  aluminum .PERIOD i've  heard  this  dress  actually  sort  of  sounds  like  wind  chimes  as  they  walk  through .PERIOD so ,COMMA one  of  the  magical  side  effects  of  having  a  culture  of  copying ,COMMA which  is  really  what  it  is ,COMMA is  the  establishment  of  trends .PERIOD people  think  this  is  a  magical  thing .PERIOD how  does  it  happen ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA it  's  because  it  's  legal  for  people  to  copy  one  another .PERIOD some  people  believe  that  there  are  a  few  people  at  the  top  of  the  fashion  food  chain  who  sort  of  dictate  to  us  what  we  're  all  going  to  wear .PERIOD but  if  you  talk  to  any  designer  at  any  level ,COMMA including  these  high-end  designers ,COMMA they  always  say  their  main  inspiration  comes  from  the  street ,COMMA where  people  like  you  and  me  remix  and  match  our  own  fashion  looks .PERIOD and  that  's  where  they  really  get  a  lot  of  their  creative  inspiration .PERIOD so  it  's  both  a  top-down  and  a  bottom-up  kind  of  industry .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  fast  fashion  giants  have  probably  benefited  the  most  from  the  lack  of  copyright  protection  in  the  fashion  industry .PERIOD they  are  notorious  for  knocking  off  high-end  designs  and  selling  them  at  very  low  prices .PERIOD and  they've  been  faced  with  a  lot  of  lawsuits ,COMMA but  those  lawsuits  are  usually  not  won  by  fashion  designers .PERIOD the  courts  have  said  over  and  over  again ,COMMA you  do  n't  need  any  more  intellectual  property  protection .PERIOD when  you  look  at  copies  like  this ,COMMA you  wonder ,COMMA how  do  the  luxury  high-end  brands  remain  in  business ?QUESTIONMARK if  you  can  get  it  for  200  bucks ,COMMA why  pay  a  thousand ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA that  's  one  reason  we  had  a  conference  here  at  usc  a  few  years  ago .PERIOD we  invited  tom  ford  to  come  -- .PERIOD the  conference  was  called ,COMMA ready  to  share ,COMMA fashion  and  the  ownership  of  creativity  -- .PERIOD and  we  asked  him  exactly  this  question .PERIOD here  's  what  he  had  to  say .PERIOD he  had  just  come  off  a  successful  stint  as  the  lead  designer  at  gucci ,COMMA in  case  you  did  n't  know .PERIOD tom  ford ,COMMA and  we  found  after  much  research  that ,COMMA actually  not  much  research ,COMMA quite  simple  research ,COMMA that  the  counterfeit  customer  was  not  our  customer .PERIOD the  people  on  santee  alley  are  not  the  ones  who  shop  at  gucci .PERIOD this  is  a  very  different  demographic .PERIOD and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA a  knock-off  is  never  the  same  as  an  original  high-end  design ,COMMA at  least  in  terms  of  the  materials .PERIOD they  're  always  made  of  cheaper  materials .PERIOD but  even  sometimes  a  cheaper  version  can  actually  have  some  charming  aspects ,COMMA can  breathe  a  little  extra  life  into  a  dying  trend .PERIOD there  's  lots  of  virtues  of  copying .PERIOD one  that  a  lot  of  cultural  critics  have  pointed  to  is  that  we  now  have  a  much  broader  palette  of  design  choices  to  choose  from  than  we  ever  have  before .PERIOD and  this  is  mainly  because  of  the  fast  fashion  industry ,COMMA actually .PERIOD and  this  is  a  good  thing .PERIOD we  need  lots  of  options .PERIOD fashion ,COMMA whether  you  like  it  or  not ,COMMA helps  you  project  who  you  are  to  the  world .PERIOD because  of  fast  fashion ,COMMA global  trends  actually  get  established  much  more  quickly  than  they  used  to .PERIOD and  this ,COMMA actually ,COMMA is  good  news  to  trendsetters .PERIOD they  want  trends  to  be  set  so  that  they  can  move  product .PERIOD for  fashionistas ,COMMA they  want  to  stay  ahead  of  the  curve .PERIOD they  do  n't  want  to  be  wearing  what  everybody  else  is  wearing .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA they  want  to  move  on  to  the  next  trend  as  soon  as  possible .PERIOD i  tell  you ,COMMA there  is  no  rest  for  the  fashionable .PERIOD every  season ,COMMA these  designers  have  to  struggle  to  come  up  with  the  new  fabulous  idea  that  everybody  's  going  to  love .PERIOD and  this ,COMMA let  me  tell  you ,COMMA is  very  good  for  the  bottom  line .PERIOD now  of  course ,COMMA there  's  a  bunch  of  effects  that  this  culture  of  copying  has  on  the  creative  process .PERIOD and  stuart  weitzman  is  a  very  successful  shoe  designer .PERIOD he  has  complained  a  lot  about  people  copying  him .PERIOD but  in  one  interview  i  read ,COMMA he  said  it  has  really  forced  him  to  up  his  game .PERIOD he  had  to  come  up  with  new  ideas ,COMMA new  things  that  would  be  hard  to  copy .PERIOD he  came  up  with  this  bowden-wedge  heel  that  has  to  be  made  out  of  steel  or  titanium .PERIOD if  you  make  it  from  some  sort  of  cheaper  material ,COMMA it  'll  actually  crack  in  two .PERIOD it  forced  him  to  be  a  little  more  innovative .PERIOD and  that  actually  reminded  me  of  jazz  great ,COMMA charlie  parker .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  if  you've  heard  this  anecdote ,COMMA but  i  have .PERIOD he  said  that  one  of  the  reasons  he  invented  bebop  was  that  he  was  pretty  sure  that  white  musicians  would  n't  be  able  to  replicate  the  sound .PERIOD he  wanted  to  make  it  too  difficult  to  copy .PERIOD and  that  's  what  fashion  designers  are  doing  all  the  time .PERIOD they  're  trying  to  put  together  a  signature  look ,COMMA an  aesthetic  that  reflects  who  they  are .PERIOD when  people  knock  it  off ,COMMA everybody  knows  because  they've  put  that  look  out  on  the  runway ,COMMA and  it  's  a  coherent  aesthetic .PERIOD i  love  these  gallianos .PERIOD okay ,COMMA we  'll  move  on .PERIOD this  is  not  unlike  the  world  of  comedy .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  if  you  know  that  jokes  also  cannot  be  copyright  protected .PERIOD so  when  one-liners  were  really  popular ,COMMA everybody  stole  them  from  one  another .PERIOD but  now ,COMMA we  have  a  different  kind  of  comic .PERIOD they  develop  a  persona ,COMMA a  signature  style ,COMMA much  like  fashion  designers .PERIOD and  their  jokes ,COMMA much  like  the  fashion  designs  by  a  fashion  designer ,COMMA really  only  work  within  that  aesthetic .PERIOD if  somebody  steals  a  joke  from  larry  david ,COMMA for  instance ,COMMA it  's  not  as  funny .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  other  thing  that  fashion  designers  have  done  to  survive  in  this  culture  of  copying  is  they've  learned  how  to  copy  themselves .PERIOD they  knock  themselves  off .PERIOD they  make  deals  with  the  fast  fashion  giants  and  they  come  up  with  a  way  to  sell  their  product  to  a  whole  new  demographic ,COMMA the  santee  alley  demographic .PERIOD now ,COMMA some  fashion  designers  will  say ,COMMA it  's  only  in  the  united  states  that  we  do  n't  have  any  respect .PERIOD in  other  countries  there  is  protection  for  our  artful  designs .PERIOD but  if  you  take  a  look  at  the  two  other  biggest  markets  in  the  world ,COMMA it  turns  out  that  the  protection  that  's  offered  is  really  ineffectual .PERIOD in  japan ,COMMA for  instance ,COMMA which  i  think  is  the  third  largest  market ,COMMA they  have  a  design  law .PERIOD it  protects  apparel ,COMMA but  the  novelty  standard  is  so  high ,COMMA you  have  to  prove  that  your  garment  has  never  existed  before .PERIOD it  's  totally  unique .PERIOD and  that  's  sort  of  like  the  novelty  standard  for  a  us .PERIOD patent ,COMMA which  fashion  designers  never  get ,COMMA rarely  get  here  in  the  states .PERIOD in  the  european  union ,COMMA they  went  in  the  other  direction .PERIOD very  low  novelty  standard ,COMMA anybody  can  register  anything .PERIOD but  even  though  it  's  the  home  of  the  fast  fashion  industry  and  you  have  a  lot  of  luxury  designers  there ,COMMA they  do  n't  register  their  garments ,COMMA generally ,COMMA and  there  's  not  a  lot  of  litigation .PERIOD it  turns  out  it  's  because  the  novelty  standard  is  too  low .PERIOD a  person  can  come  in  and  take  somebody  else  's  gown ,COMMA cut  off  three  inches  from  the  bottom ,COMMA go  to  the  eu .PERIOD and  register  it  as  a  new ,COMMA original  design .PERIOD so ,COMMA that  does  not  stop  the  knock-off  artists .PERIOD if  you  look  at  the  registry ,COMMA actually ,COMMA a  lot  of  the  registered  things  in  the  eu .PERIOD are  nike  t-shirts  that  are  almost  identical  to  one  another .PERIOD but  this  has  not  stopped  diane  von  furstenberg .PERIOD she  is  the  head  of  the  council  of  fashion  designers  of  america ,COMMA and  she  has  told  her  constituency  that  she  is  going  to  get  copyright  protection  for  fashion  designs .PERIOD the  retailers  have  kind  of  quashed  this  notion  though .PERIOD i  do  n't  think  the  legislation  is  going  anywhere .PERIOD because  they  realized  it  is  so  hard  to  tell  the  difference  between  a  pirated  design  and  something  that  's  just  part  of  a  global  trend .PERIOD who  owns  a  look ?QUESTIONMARK that  is  a  very  difficult  question  to  answer .PERIOD it  takes  lots  of  lawyers  and  lots  of  court  time .PERIOD and  the  retailers  decided  that  would  be  way  too  expensive .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA it  's  not  just  the  fashion  industry  that  does  n't  have  copyright  protection .PERIOD there  's  a  bunch  of  other  industries  that  do  n't  have  copyright  protection ,COMMA including  the  food  industry .PERIOD you  cannot  copyright  a  recipe  because  it  's  a  set  of  instructions ,COMMA it  's  fact .PERIOD and  you  cannot  copyright  the  look  and  feel  of  even  the  most  unique  dish .PERIOD same  with  automobiles .PERIOD it  does  n't  matter  how  wacky  they  look  or  how  cool  they  look ,COMMA you  cannot  copyright  the  sculptural  design .PERIOD it  's  a  utilitarian  article ,COMMA that  's  why .PERIOD same  with  furniture .PERIOD it  's  too  utilitarian .PERIOD magic  tricks ,COMMA i  think  they  're  instructions ,COMMA sort  of  like  recipes: .PERIOD no  copyright  protection .PERIOD hairdos ,COMMA no  copyright  protection .PERIOD open  source  software ,COMMA these  guys  decided  they  did  n't  want  copyright  protection .PERIOD they  thought  it'd  be  more  innovative  without  it .PERIOD it  's  really  hard  to  get  copyright  for  databases .PERIOD tattoo  artists ,COMMA they  do  n't  want  it .PERIOD it  's  not  cool .PERIOD they  share  their  designs .PERIOD jokes ,COMMA no  copyright  protection .PERIOD fireworks  displays .PERIOD the  rules  of  games .PERIOD the  smell  of  perfume ,COMMA no .PERIOD and  some  of  these  industries  may  seem  sort  of  marginal  to  you ,COMMA but  these  are  the  gross  sales  for  low  ip .PERIOD industries ,COMMA industries  with  very  little  copyright  protection .PERIOD and  there  's  the  gross  sales  of  films  and  books .PERIOD it  ai  n't  pretty .PERIOD so  you  talk  to  people  in  the  fashion  industry  and  they  're  like ,COMMA shhh .PERIOD do  n't  tell  anybody  we  can  actually  steal  from  each  other  's  designs .PERIOD it  's  embarrassing .PERIOD but  you  know  what ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  revolutionary .PERIOD and  it  's  a  model  that  a  lot  of  other  industries ,COMMA like  the  ones  we  just  saw  with  the  really  small  bars ,COMMA they  might  have  to  think  about  this .PERIOD because  right  now ,COMMA those  industries  with  a  lot  of  copyright  protection  are  operating  in  an  atmosphere  where  it  's  as  if  they  do  n't  have  any  protection .PERIOD and  they  do  n't  know  what  to  do .PERIOD when  i  found  out  that  there  are  a  whole  bunch  of  industries  that  did  n't  have  copyright  protection ,COMMA i  thought ,COMMA what  exactly  is  the  underlying  logic ?QUESTIONMARK i  want  a  picture  and  the  lawyers  do  not  provide  a  picture .PERIOD so  i  made  one .PERIOD these  are  the  two  main  sort  of  binary  oppositions  within  the  logic  of  copyright  law .PERIOD it  is  more  complex  than  this ,COMMA but  this  will  do .PERIOD first ,COMMA is  something  an  artistic  object ?QUESTIONMARK then  it  deserves  protection .PERIOD is  it  a  utilitarian  object ?QUESTIONMARK then  no ,COMMA it  does  not  deserve  protection .PERIOD this  is  a  difficult ,COMMA unstable  binary .PERIOD the  other  one  is ,COMMA is  it  an  idea ?QUESTIONMARK is  it  something  that  needs  to  freely  circulate  in  a  free  society ?QUESTIONMARK no  protection .PERIOD or  is  it  a  physically  fixed  expression  of  an  idea ,COMMA something  that  somebody  made  and  they  deserve  to  own  it  for  a  while  and  make  money  from  it ?QUESTIONMARK the  problem  is  that  digital  technology  has  completely  subverted  the  logic  of  this  physically  fixed ,COMMA expression  versus  idea  concept .PERIOD nowadays ,COMMA we  do  n't  really  recognize  a  book  as  something  that  sits  on  our  shelf  or  music  as  something  that  is  a  physical  object  that  we  can  hold .PERIOD it  's  a  digital  file .PERIOD it  is  barely  tethered  to  any  sort  of  physical  reality  in  our  minds .PERIOD and  these  things ,COMMA because  we  can  copy  and  transmit  them  so  easily ,COMMA actually  circulate  within  our  culture  a  lot  more  like  ideas  than  like  physically  instantiated  objects .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  conceptual  issues  are  truly  profound  when  you  talk  about  creativity  and  ownership  and ,COMMA let  me  tell  you ,COMMA we  do  n't  want  to  leave  this  just  to  lawyers  to  figure  out .PERIOD they  're  smart .PERIOD i  'm  with  one .PERIOD he  's  my  boyfriend ,COMMA he  's  okay .PERIOD he  's  smart ,COMMA he  's  smart .PERIOD but  you  want  an  interdisciplinary  team  of  people  hashing  this  out ,COMMA trying  to  figure  out ,COMMA what  is  the  kind  of  ownership  model ,COMMA in  a  digital  world ,COMMA that  's  going  to  lead  to  the  most  innovation ?QUESTIONMARK and  my  suggestion  is  that  fashion  might  be  a  really  good  place  to  start  looking  for  a  model  for  creative  industries  in  the  future .PERIOD if  you  want  more  information  about  this  research  project ,COMMA please  visit  our  website ,COMMA it  's  readytoshareorg .PERIOD and  i  really  want  to  thank  veronica  jauriqui  for  making  this  very  fashionable  presentation .PERIOD thank  you  so  much .PERIOD the  national  portrait  gallery  is  the  place  dedicated  to  presenting  great  american  lives ,COMMA amazing  people .PERIOD and  that  's  what  it  's  about .PERIOD we  use  portraiture  as  a  way  to  deliver  those  lives ,COMMA but  that  's  it .PERIOD and  so  i  'm  not  going  to  talk  about  the  painted  portrait  today .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  talk  about  a  program  i  started  there ,COMMA which ,COMMA from  my  point  of  view ,COMMA is  the  proudest  thing  i  did .PERIOD i  started  to  worry  about  the  fact  that  a  lot  of  people  do  n't  get  their  portraits  painted  anymore ,COMMA and  they  're  amazing  people ,COMMA and  we  want  to  deliver  them  to  future  generations .PERIOD so ,COMMA how  do  we  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK and  so  i  came  up  with  the  idea  of  the  living  self-portrait  series .PERIOD and  the  living  self-portrait  series  was  the  idea  of  basically  my  being  a  brush  in  the  hand  of  amazing  people  who  would  come  and  i  would  interview .PERIOD and  so  what  i  'm  going  to  do  is ,COMMA not  so  much  give  you  the  great  hits  of  that  program ,COMMA as  to  give  you  this  whole  notion  of  how  you  encounter  people  in  that  kind  of  situation ,COMMA what  you  try  to  find  out  about  them ,COMMA and  when  people  deliver  and  when  they  do  n't  and  why .PERIOD now ,COMMA i  had  two  preconditions .PERIOD one  was  that  they  be  american .PERIOD that  's  just  because ,COMMA in  the  nature  of  the  national  portrait  gallery ,COMMA it  's  created  to  look  at  american  lives .PERIOD that  was  easy ,COMMA but  then  i  made  the  decision ,COMMA maybe  arbitrary ,COMMA that  they  needed  to  be  people  of  a  certain  age ,COMMA which  at  that  point ,COMMA when  i  created  this  program ,COMMA seemed  really  old .PERIOD sixties ,COMMA seventies ,COMMA eighties  and  nineties .PERIOD for  obvious  reasons ,COMMA it  does  n't  seem  that  old  anymore  to  me .PERIOD and  why  did  i  do  that ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA for  one  thing ,COMMA we  're  a  youth-obsessed  culture .PERIOD and  i  thought  really  what  we  need  is  an  elders  program  to  just  sit  at  the  feet  of  amazing  people  and  hear  them  talk .PERIOD but  the  second  part  of  it ,COMMA and  the  older  i  get ,COMMA the  more  convinced  i  am  that  that  's  true .PERIOD it  's  amazing  what  people  will  say  when  they  know  how  the  story  turned  out .PERIOD that  's  the  one  advantage  that  older  people  have .PERIOD well ,COMMA they  have  other ,COMMA little  bit  of  advantage ,COMMA but  they  also  have  some  disadvantages ,COMMA but  the  one  thing  they  or  we  have  is  that  we've  reached  the  point  in  life  where  we  know  how  the  story  turned  out .PERIOD so ,COMMA we  can  then  go  back  in  our  lives ,COMMA if  we've  got  an  interviewer  who  gets  that ,COMMA and  begin  to  reflect  on  how  we  got  there .PERIOD all  of  those  accidents  that  wound  up  creating  the  life  narrative  that  we  inherited .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  thought  okay ,COMMA now ,COMMA what  is  it  going  to  take  to  make  this  work ?QUESTIONMARK there  are  many  kinds  of  interviews .PERIOD we  know  them .PERIOD there  are  the  journalist  interviews ,COMMA which  are  the  interrogation  that  is  expected .PERIOD this  is  somewhat  against  resistance  and  caginess  on  the  part  of  the  interviewee .PERIOD then  there  's  the  celebrity  interview ,COMMA where  it  's  more  important  who  's  asking  the  question  than  who  answers .PERIOD that  's  barbara  walters  and  others  like  that ,COMMA and  we  like  that .PERIOD that  's  frost-nixon ,COMMA where  frost  seems  to  be  as  important  as  nixon  in  that  process .PERIOD fair  enough .PERIOD but  i  wanted  interviews  that  were  different .PERIOD i  wanted  to  be ,COMMA as  i  later  thought  of  it ,COMMA empathic ,COMMA which  is  to  say ,COMMA to  feel  what  they  wanted  to  say  and  to  be  an  agent  of  their  self-revelation .PERIOD by  the  way ,COMMA this  was  always  done  in  public .PERIOD this  was  not  an  oral  history  program .PERIOD this  was  all  about  300  people  sitting  at  the  feet  of  this  individual ,COMMA and  having  me  be  the  brush  in  their  self-portrait .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  turns  out  that  i  was  pretty  good  at  that .PERIOD i  did  n't  know  it  coming  into  it .PERIOD and  the  only  reason  i  really  know  that  is  because  of  one  interview  i  did  with  senator  william  fulbright ,COMMA and  that  was  six  months  after  he'd  had  a  stroke .PERIOD and  he  had  never  appeared  in  public  since  that  point .PERIOD this  was  not  a  devastating  stroke ,COMMA but  it  did  affect  his  speaking  and  so  forth .PERIOD and  i  thought  it  was  worth  a  chance ,COMMA he  thought  it  was  worth  a  chance ,COMMA and  so  we  got  up  on  the  stage ,COMMA and  we  had  an  hour  conversation  about  his  life ,COMMA and  after  that  a  woman  rushed  up  to  me ,COMMA essentially  did ,COMMA and  she  said ,COMMA where  did  you  train  as  a  doctor ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  said ,COMMA i  have  no  training  as  a  doctor .PERIOD i  never  claimed  that .PERIOD and  she  said ,COMMA well ,COMMA something  very  weird  was  happening .PERIOD when  he  started  a  sentence ,COMMA particularly  in  the  early  parts  of  the  interview ,COMMA and  paused ,COMMA you  gave  him  the  word ,COMMA the  bridge  to  get  to  the  end  of  the  sentence ,COMMA and  by  the  end  of  it ,COMMA he  was  speaking  complete  sentences  on  his  own .PERIOD i  did  n't  know  what  was  going  on ,COMMA but  i  was  so  part  of  the  process  of  getting  that  out .PERIOD so  i  thought ,COMMA okay ,COMMA fine ,COMMA i've  got  empathy ,COMMA or  empathy ,COMMA at  any  rate ,COMMA is  what  's  critical  to  this  kind  of  interview .PERIOD but  then  i  began  to  think  of  other  things .PERIOD who  makes  a  great  interview  in  this  context ?QUESTIONMARK it  had  nothing  to  do  with  their  intellect ,COMMA the  quality  of  their  intellect .PERIOD some  of  them  were  very  brilliant ,COMMA some  of  them  were ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA ordinary  people  who  would  never  claim  to  be  intellectuals ,COMMA but  it  was  never  about  that .PERIOD it  was  about  their  energy .PERIOD it  's  energy  that  creates  extraordinary  interviews  and  extraordinary  lives .PERIOD i  'm  convinced  of  it .PERIOD and  it  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  energy  of  being  young .PERIOD these  were  people  through  their  90s .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA the  first  person  i  interviewed  was  george  abbott ,COMMA who  was  97 ,COMMA and  abbott  was  filled  with  the  life  force ,COMMA i  guess  that  's  the  way  i  think  about  it ,COMMA filled  with  it .PERIOD and  so  he  filled  the  room ,COMMA and  we  had  an  extraordinary  conversation .PERIOD he  was  supposed  to  be  the  toughest  interview  that  anybody  would  ever  do  because  he  was  famous  for  being  silent ,COMMA for  never  ever  saying  anything  except  maybe  a  word  or  two .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA he  did  wind  up  opening  up ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA his  energy  is  evidenced  in  other  ways .PERIOD he  subsequently  got  married  again  at  102 ,COMMA so  he ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA he  had  a  lot  of  the  life  force  in  him .PERIOD but  after  the  interview ,COMMA i  got  a  call ,COMMA very  gruff  voice ,COMMA from  a  woman .PERIOD i  did  n't  know  who  she  was ,COMMA and  she  said ,COMMA did  you  get  george  abbott  to  talk ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  said ,COMMA yeah .PERIOD apparently  i  did .PERIOD and  she  said ,COMMA i  'm  his  old  girlfriend ,COMMA maureen  stapleton ,COMMA and  i  could  never  do  it .PERIOD and  then  she  made  me  go  up  with  the  tape  of  it  and  prove  that  george  abbott  actually  could  talk .PERIOD so ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA you  want  energy ,COMMA you  want  the  life  force ,COMMA but  you  really  want  them  also  to  think  that  they  have  a  story  worth  sharing .PERIOD the  worst  interviews  that  you  can  ever  have  are  with  people  who  are  modest .PERIOD never  ever  get  up  on  a  stage  with  somebody  who  's  modest ,COMMA because  all  of  these  people  have  been  assembled  to  listen  to  them ,COMMA and  they  sit  there  and  they  say ,COMMA aw ,COMMA shucks ,COMMA it  was  an  accident .PERIOD there  's  nothing  that  ever  happens  that  justifies  people  taking  good  hours  of  the  day  to  be  with  them .PERIOD the  worst  interview  i  ever  did ,COMMA william  l .PERIOD shirer .PERIOD the  journalist  who  did  the  rise  and  fall  of  the  third  reich  this  guy  had  met  hitler  and  gandhi  within  six  months ,COMMA and  every  time  i'd  ask  him  about  it ,COMMA he'd  say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i  just  happened  to  be  there .PERIOD did  n't  matter  whatever .PERIOD awful .PERIOD i  never  would  ever  agree  to  interview  a  modest  person .PERIOD they  have  to  think  that  they  did  something  and  that  they  want  to  share  it  with  you .PERIOD but  it  comes  down ,COMMA in  the  end ,COMMA to  how  do  you  get  through  all  the  barriers  we  have .PERIOD all  of  us  are  public  and  private  beings ,COMMA and  if  all  you  're  going  to  get  from  the  interviewee  is  their  public  self ,COMMA there  's  no  point  in  it .PERIOD it  's  pre-programmed .PERIOD it  's  infomercial ,COMMA and  we  all  have  infomercials  about  our  lives .PERIOD we  know  the  great  lines ,COMMA we  know  the  great  moments ,COMMA we  know  what  we  're  not  going  to  share ,COMMA and  the  point  of  this  was  not  to  embarrass  anybody .PERIOD this  was  n't ,COMMA and  some  of  you  will  remember  mike  wallace  's  old  interviews ,COMMA tough ,COMMA aggressive  and  so  forth .PERIOD they  have  their  place .PERIOD i  was  trying  to  get  them  to  say  what  they  probably  wanted  to  say ,COMMA to  break  out  of  their  own  cocoon  of  the  public  self ,COMMA and  the  more  public  they  had  been ,COMMA the  more  entrenched  that  person ,COMMA that  outer  person  was .PERIOD and  let  me  tell  you  at  once  the  worse  moment  and  the  best  moment  that  happened  in  this  interview  series .PERIOD it  all  has  to  do  with  that  shell  that  most  of  us  have ,COMMA and  particularly  certain  people .PERIOD there  's  an  extraordinary  woman  named  clare  boothe  luce .PERIOD it  'll  be  your  generational  determinant  as  to  whether  her  name  means  much  to  you .PERIOD she  did  so  much .PERIOD she  was  a  playwright .PERIOD she  did  an  extraordinary  play  called  the  women .PERIOD she  was  a  congresswoman  when  there  were  n't  very  many  congresswomen .PERIOD she  was  editor  of  vanity  fair ,COMMA one  of  the  great  phenomenal  women  of  her  day .PERIOD and ,COMMA incidentally ,COMMA i  call  her  the  eleanor  roosevelt  of  the  right .PERIOD she  was  sort  of  adored  on  the  right  the  way  eleanor  roosevelt  was  on  the  left .PERIOD and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA when  we  did  the  interview ,COMMA i  did  the  living  self-portrait  with  her ,COMMA there  were  three  former  directors  of  the  cia  basically  sitting  at  her  feet ,COMMA just  enjoying  her  presence .PERIOD and  i  thought ,COMMA this  is  going  to  be  a  piece  of  cake ,COMMA because  i  always  have  preliminary  talks  with  these  people  for  just  maybe  10  or  15  minutes .PERIOD we  never  talk  before  that  because  if  you  talk  before ,COMMA you  do  n't  get  it  on  the  stage .PERIOD so  she  and  i  had  a  delightful  conversation .PERIOD we  were  on  the  stage  and  then ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA spectacular .PERIOD it  was  all  part  of  clare  boothe  luce  's  look .PERIOD she  was  in  a  great  evening  gown .PERIOD she  was  80 ,COMMA almost  that  day  of  the  interview ,COMMA and  there  she  was  and  there  i  was ,COMMA and  i  just  proceeded  into  the  questions .PERIOD and  she  stonewalled  me .PERIOD it  was  unbelievable .PERIOD anything  that  i  would  ask ,COMMA she  would  turn  around ,COMMA dismiss ,COMMA and  i  was  basically  up  there ,COMMA any  of  you  in  the  moderate-to-full  entertainment  world  know  what  it  is  to  die  onstage .PERIOD and  i  was  dying .PERIOD she  was  absolutely  not  giving  me  a  thing .PERIOD and  i  began  to  wonder  what  was  going  on ,COMMA and  you  think  while  you  talk ,COMMA and  basically ,COMMA i  thought ,COMMA i  got  it .PERIOD when  we  were  alone ,COMMA i  was  her  audience .PERIOD now  i  'm  her  competitor  for  the  audience .PERIOD that  's  the  problem  here ,COMMA and  she  's  fighting  me  for  that ,COMMA and  so  then  i  asked  her  a  question ,COMMA i  did  n't  know  how  i  was  going  to  get  out  of  it ,COMMA i  asked  her  a  question  about  her  days  as  a  playwright ,COMMA and  again ,COMMA characteristically ,COMMA instead  of  saying ,COMMA oh  yes ,COMMA i  was  a  playwright ,COMMA and  this  is  what  blah  blah  blah ,COMMA she  said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA playwright .PERIOD everybody  knows  i  was  a  playwright .PERIOD most  people  think  that  i  was  an  actress .PERIOD i  was  never  an  actress .PERIOD but  i  had  n't  asked  that ,COMMA and  then  she  went  off  on  a  tear ,COMMA and  she  said ,COMMA oh ,COMMA well ,COMMA there  was  that  one  time  that  i  was  an  actress .PERIOD it  was  for  a  charity  in  connecticut  when  i  was  a  congresswoman ,COMMA and  i  got  up  there ,COMMA and  she  went  on  and  on ,COMMA and  then  i  got  on  the  stage .PERIOD and  then  she  turned  to  me  and  said ,COMMA and  you  know  what  those  young  actors  did ?QUESTIONMARK they  upstaged  me  and  she  said ,COMMA do  you  know  what  that  is ?QUESTIONMARK just  withering  in  her  contempt .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA i  'm  learning .PERIOD and  she  looked  at  me ,COMMA and  it  was  like  the  successful  arm-wrestle ,COMMA and  then ,COMMA after  that ,COMMA she  delivered  an  extraordinary  account  of  what  her  life  really  was  like .PERIOD i  have  to  end  that  one .PERIOD this  is  my  tribute  to  clare  boothe  luce .PERIOD again ,COMMA a  remarkable  person .PERIOD i  'm  not  politically  attracted  to  her ,COMMA but  through  her  life  force ,COMMA i  'm  attracted  to  her .PERIOD and  the  way  she  died ,COMMA she  had ,COMMA toward  the  end ,COMMA a  brain  tumor .PERIOD that  's  probably  as  terrible  a  way  to  die  as  you  can  imagine ,COMMA and  very  few  of  us  were  invited  to  a  dinner  party .PERIOD and  she  was  in  horrible  pain .PERIOD we  all  knew  that .PERIOD she  stayed  in  her  room .PERIOD everybody  came .PERIOD the  butler  passed  around  canapes .PERIOD the  usual  sort  of  thing .PERIOD then  at  a  certain  moment ,COMMA the  door  opened  and  she  walked  out  perfectly  dressed ,COMMA completely  composed .PERIOD the  public  self ,COMMA the  beauty ,COMMA the  intellect ,COMMA and  she  walked  around  and  talked  to  every  person  there  and  then  went  back  into  the  room  and  was  never  seen  again .PERIOD she  wanted  the  control  of  her  final  moment ,COMMA and  she  did  it  amazingly .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  are  other  ways  that  you  get  somebody  to  open  up ,COMMA and  this  is  just  a  brief  reference .PERIOD it  was  n't  this  arm-wrestle ,COMMA but  it  was  a  little  surprising  for  the  person  involved .PERIOD i  interviewed  steve  martin .PERIOD it  was  n't  all  that  long  ago .PERIOD and  we  were  sitting  there ,COMMA and  almost  toward  the  beginning  of  the  interview ,COMMA i  turned  to  him  and  i  said ,COMMA steve ,COMMA or  mr.  martin ,COMMA it  is  said  that  all  comedians  have  unhappy  childhoods .PERIOD was  yours  unhappy ?QUESTIONMARK and  he  looked  at  me ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA as  if  to  say ,COMMA this  is  how  you  're  going  to  start  this  thing ,COMMA right  off ?QUESTIONMARK and  then  he  turned  to  me ,COMMA not  stupidly ,COMMA and  he  said ,COMMA what  was  your  childhood  like ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  said ,COMMA these  are  all  arm  wrestles ,COMMA but  they  're  affectionate ,COMMA and  i  said ,COMMA my  father  was  loving  and  supportive ,COMMA which  is  why  i  'm  not  funny .PERIOD and  he  looked  at  me ,COMMA and  then  we  heard  the  big  sad  story .PERIOD his  father  was  an  sob ,COMMA and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA he  was  another  comedian  with  an  unhappy  childhood ,COMMA but  then  we  were  off  and  running .PERIOD so  the  question  is ,COMMA what  is  the  key  that  's  going  to  allow  this  to  proceed ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA these  are  arm  wrestle  questions ,COMMA but  i  want  to  tell  you  about  questions  that  are  more  related  to  empathy  and  that  really ,COMMA very  often ,COMMA are  the  questions  that  people  have  been  waiting  their  whole  lives  to  be  asked .PERIOD and  i  'll  just  give  you  two  examples  of  this  because  of  the  time  constraints .PERIOD one  was  an  interview  i  did  with  one  of  the  great  american  biographers .PERIOD again ,COMMA some  of  you  will  know  him ,COMMA most  of  you  wo  n't ,COMMA dumas  malone .PERIOD he  did  a  five-volume  biography  of  thomas  jefferson ,COMMA spent  virtually  his  whole  life  with  thomas  jefferson ,COMMA and  by  the  way ,COMMA at  one  point  i  asked  him ,COMMA would  you

also  up .PERIOD so  this  small  missing  chunk  here  is  puzzling .PERIOD since  the  big  content  markets  have  grown  in  line  with  historic  norms ,COMMA it  's  not  additional  growth  that  piracy  has  prevented ,COMMA but  copyright  math  tells  us  it  must  therefore  be  foregone  growth  in  a  market  that  has  no  historic  norms ,COMMA one  that  did  n't  exist  in  the  90  's .PERIOD what  we  're  looking  at  here  is  the  insidious  cost  of  ringtone  piracy .PERIOD 50  billion  dollars  of  it  a  year ,COMMA which  is  enough ,COMMA at  30  seconds  a  ringtone ,COMMA that  could  stretch  from  here  to  neanderthal  times .PERIOD it  's  true .PERIOD i  have  excel .PERIOD the  movie  folks  also  tell  us  that  our  economy  loses  over  370,000  jobs  to  content  theft ,COMMA which  is  quite  a  lot  when  you  consider  that ,COMMA back  in  98 ,COMMA the  bureau  of  labor  statistics  indicated  that  the  motion  picture  and  video  industries  were  employing  270,000  people .PERIOD other  data  has  the  music  industry  at  about  45,000  people .PERIOD and  so  the  job  losses  that  came  with  the  internet  and  all  that  content  theft ,COMMA have  therefore  left  us  with  negative  employment  in  our  content  industries .PERIOD and  this  is  just  one  of  the  many  mind-blowing  statistics  that  copyright  mathematicians  have  to  deal  with  every  day .PERIOD and  some  people  think  that  string  theory  is  tough .PERIOD now  this  is  a  key  number  from  the  copyright  mathematicians  toolkit .PERIOD it  's  the  precise  amount  of  harm  that  comes  to  media  companies  whenever  a  single  copyrighted  song  or  movie  gets  pirated .PERIOD hollywood  and  congress  derived  this  number  mathematically .PERIOD back  when  they  last  sat  down  to  improve  copyright  damages  and  made  this  law .PERIOD some  people  think  this  number  's  a  little  bit  large ,COMMA but  copyright  mathematicians  who  are  media  lobby  experts  are  merely  surprised  that  it  does  n't  get  compounded  for  inflation  every  year .PERIOD now  when  this  law  first  passed ,COMMA the  world  's  hottest  mp3  player  could  hold  just  10  songs .PERIOD and  it  was  a  big  christmas  hit .PERIOD because  what  little  hoodlum  would  n't  want  a  million  and  a  half  bucks-worth  of  stolen  goods  in  his  pocket .PERIOD these  days  an  ipod  classic  can  hold  40,000  songs ,COMMA which  is  to  say  eight  billion  dollars-worth  of  stolen  media .PERIOD or  about  75,000  jobs .PERIOD now  you  might  find  copyright  math  strange ,COMMA but  that  's  because  it  's  a  field  that  's  best  left  to  experts .PERIOD i  hope  you  'll  join  me  next  time  when  i  will  be  making  an  equally  scientific  and  fact-based  inquiry  into  the  cost  of  alien  music  piracy  to  he  american  economy .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD this  is  very  strange  for  me ,COMMA because  i'm  not  used  to  doing  this: .PERIOD i  usually  stand  on  the  other  side  of  the  light ,COMMA and  now  i  'm  feeling  the  pressure  i  put  other  people  into .PERIOD and  it  's  hard .PERIOD the  previous  speaker  has ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA really  painted  a  very  good  background  as  to  the  impulse  behind  my  work  and  what  drives  me ,COMMA and  my  sense  of  loss ,COMMA and  trying  to  find  the  answer  to  the  big  questions .PERIOD but  this ,COMMA for  me ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA coming  here  to  do  this ,COMMA feels  like ,COMMA there's  this  sculptor  that  i  like  very  much ,COMMA giacometti ,COMMA who  after  many  years  of  living  in  france ,COMMA and

what  cinema  is  for  me ,COMMA and  where  i  'm  coming  from  in  terms  of  cinema .PERIOD the  first  piece  was ,COMMA really ,COMMA there  's  a  young  woman  talking  about  nigeria ,COMMA that  she  has  a  feeling  she  'll  be  happy  there .PERIOD these  are  the  sentiments  of  someone  that  's  been  away  from  home .PERIOD and  that  was  something  that  i  went  through

worst  part  of  nigerian  history ,COMMA this  post-colonial  history .PERIOD so ,COMMA for  this  girl  to  have  these  dreams  is  simply  how  we  preserve  a  sense  of  what  home  is .PERIOD how ,COMMA and  it  's  sort  of ,COMMA perhaps  romantic ,COMMA but  i  think  beautiful ,COMMA because  you  just  need  something  to  hold  on  to ,COMMA especially  in  a  society  where  you  feel  alienated .PERIOD which  takes  us  to  the  next  piece ,COMMA where  the  young  man  talks  about  lack  of  opportunity ,COMMA living  as  a  black  person  in  europe .PERIOD the  glass

that  's  built  up  inside  of  him ?QUESTIONMARK what  happens  with  that ?QUESTIONMARK what ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA happens  with  that  is  violence ,COMMA which  we  see  when  we  talk  about  the  ghettos  and  we  talk  about ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA south  central  la .PERIOD and  this  kind  of  stuff .PERIOD and  which  eventually ,COMMA when  channeled ,COMMA becomes ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA evolves  and  manifests  itself  as  riots ,COMMA like  the  one  in  france  two  years  ago ,COMMA where  i  live ,COMMA which  shocked  everybody ,COMMA because  everyone  thought ,COMMA oh  well ,COMMA france  is  a  liberal  society .PERIOD but  i  lived  in  england  for  18  years .PERIOD i've  lived  in  france  for  about  four ,COMMA and  i  feel  actually  thrown  back  20  years ,COMMA living  in  france .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA the  third  piece .PERIOD the  third  piece  for  me  is  the  question ,COMMA what  is  cinema  to  you ?QUESTIONMARK what  do  you  do  with  cinema ?QUESTIONMARK there  's  a  young  director ,COMMA hollywood  director ,COMMA with  his  friends ,COMMA fellow  filmmakers ,COMMA talking  about  what  cinema  means .PERIOD i  suppose  that

.PERIOD e ,COMMA so  you  are  a  liar .PERIOD na ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD just  very  quickly  to  say  that  my  point  really  here ,COMMA is  that  while  we're  making  all  these  huge  advancements ,COMMA what  we  're  doing ,COMMA which  for  me ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA i  think  we  should ,COMMA africa  should  move  forward ,COMMA but  we  should  remember ,COMMA so  we  do  not  go  back  here  again .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD emeka  okafor ,COMMA thank  you ,COMMA newton .PERIOD one  of  the  themes  that  comes  through  very  strongly  in  the  piece  we  just  watched  is  this  sense  of  the  psychological  trauma  of  the  young  that  have  to  play  this  role  of  being  child  soldiers .PERIOD and  considering  where  you  are  coming  from ,COMMA and  when  we  consider  the  extent  to  which  it's  not  taken  as  seriously  as  it  should  be ,COMMA what  would  you  have  to  say  about  that ?QUESTIONMARK na ,COMMA in  the  process  of  my  research ,COMMA i  actually  spent  a  bit  of  time  in  sierra  leone  researching  this .PERIOD and  i  remember  i  met  a  lot  of  child  soldiers ,COMMA ex-combatants ,COMMA as  they  like  to  be  called .PERIOD i  met  psychosocial  workers  who  worked  with  them .PERIOD i  met  psychiatrists  who  spent  time  with  them ,COMMA aid  workers ,COMMA ngos ,COMMA the  whole  lot .PERIOD but  i  remember  on  the  flight  back  on  my  last  trip ,COMMA i  remember  breaking  down  in  tears  and  thinking  to  myself ,COMMA if  any  kid  in  the  west ,COMMA in  the  western  world ,COMMA went  through  a  day  of  what  any  of  those  kids  have  gone  through ,COMMA they  will  be  in  therapy  for  the  rest  of  their  natural  lives .PERIOD so  for  me ,COMMA the  thought  that  we  have  all  these  children ,COMMA it's  a  generation ,COMMA we  have  a  whole  generation  of  children ,COMMA who  have  been  put  through  so  much  psychological  trauma  or  damage .PERIOD and  africa  has  to  live  with  that .PERIOD but  i'm  just  saying  to  factor  that  in ,COMMA factor  that  in  with  all  this  great  advancement ,COMMA all  this  pronouncement  of  great  achievement .PERIOD that's  really  my  thinking .PERIOD eo ,COMMA well ,COMMA we  thank  you  again  for  coming  to  the  ted  stage .PERIOD that  was  a  very  moving  piece .PERIOD na ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD eo ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD martin  luther  king  did  not  say ,COMMA i  have  a  nightmare ,COMMA when  he  inspired  the  civil  rights  movements .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA i  have  a  dream .PERIOD and  i  have  a  dream .PERIOD i  have  a  dream  that  we  can  stop  thinking  that  the  future  will  be  a  nightmare ,COMMA and  this  is  going  to  be  a  challenge ,COMMA because ,COMMA if  you  think  of  every  major  blockbusting  film  of  recent  times ,COMMA nearly  all  of  its  visions  for  humanity  are  apocalyptic .PERIOD i  think  this  film  is  one  of  the  hardest  watches  of  modern  times ,COMMA the  road .PERIOD it  's  a  beautiful  piece  of  filmmaking ,COMMA but  everything  is  desolate ,COMMA everything  is  dead .PERIOD and  just  a  father  and  son  trying  to  survive ,COMMA walking  along  the  road .PERIOD and  i  think  the  environmental  movement  of  which  i  am  a  part  of  has  been  complicit  in  creating  this  vision  of  the  future .PERIOD for  too  long ,COMMA we  have  peddled  a  nightmarish  vision  of  what  's  going  to  happen .PERIOD we  have  focused  on  the  worst-case  scenario .PERIOD we  have  focused  on  the  problems .PERIOD and  we  have  not  thought  enough  about  the  solutions .PERIOD we've  used  fear ,COMMA if  you  like ,COMMA to  grab  people  's  attention .PERIOD and  any  psychologist  will  tell  you  that  fear  in  the  organism  is  linked  to  flight  mechanism .PERIOD it  's  part  of  the  fight  and  flight  mechanism ,COMMA that  when  an  animal  is  frightened ,COMMA think  of  a  deer .PERIOD a  deer  freezes  very ,COMMA very  still ,COMMA poised  to  run  away .PERIOD and  i  think  that  's  what  we  're  doing  when  we  're  asking  people  to  engage  with  our  agenda  around  environmental  degradation  and  climate  change .PERIOD people  are  freezing  and  running  away  because  we  're  using  fear .PERIOD and  i  think  the  environmental  movement  has  to  grow  up  and  start  to  think  about  what  progress  is .PERIOD what  would  it  be  like  to  be  improving  the  human  lot ?QUESTIONMARK and  one  of  the  problems  that  we  face ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA is  that  the  only  people  that  have  cornered  the  market  in  terms  of  progress  is  a  financial  definition  of  what  progress  is ,COMMA an  economic  definition  of  what  progress  is ,COMMA that  somehow ,COMMA if  we  get  the  right  numbers  to  go  up ,COMMA we  're  going  to  be  better  off ,COMMA whether  that  's  on  the  stock  market ,COMMA whether  that  's  with  gdp  and  economic  growth ,COMMA that  somehow  life  is  going  to  get  better .PERIOD this  is  somehow  appealing  to  human  greed  instead  of  fear ,COMMA that  more  is  better .PERIOD come  on .PERIOD in  the  western  world ,COMMA we  have  enough .PERIOD maybe  some  parts  of  the  world  do  n't ,COMMA but  we  have  enough .PERIOD and  we've  know  for  a  long  time  that  this  is  not  a  good  measure  of  the  welfare  of  nations .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA the  architect  of  our  national  accounting  system ,COMMA simon  kuznets ,COMMA in  the  1930s ,COMMA said  that ,COMMA a  nation  's  welfare  can  scarcely  be  inferred  from  their  national  income .PERIOD but  we've  created  a  national  accounting  system  which  is  firmly  based  on  production  and  producing  stuff .PERIOD and  indeed ,COMMA this  is  probably  historical ,COMMA and  it  had  its  time .PERIOD in  the  second  world  war ,COMMA we  needed  to  produce  a  lot  of  stuff .PERIOD and  indeed ,COMMA we  were  so  successful  at  producing  certain  types  of  stuff  that  we  destroyed  a  lot  of  europe ,COMMA and  we  had  to  rebuild  it  afterwards .PERIOD and  so  our  national  accounting  system  became  fixated  on  what  we  can  produce .PERIOD but  as  early  as  1968 ,COMMA this  visionary  man ,COMMA robert  kennedy ,COMMA at  the  start  of  his  ill-fated  presidential  campaign ,COMMA gave  the  most  eloquent  deconstruction  of  gross  national  product  that  ever  has  been .PERIOD and  he  finished  his  talk  with  the  phrase ,COMMA that ,COMMA the  gross  national  product  measures  everything  except  that  which  makes  life  worthwhile .PERIOD how  crazy  is  that ?QUESTIONMARK that  our  measure  of  progress ,COMMA our  dominant  measure  of  progress  in  society ,COMMA is  measuring  everything  except  that  which  makes  life  worthwhile ?QUESTIONMARK i  believe ,COMMA if  kennedy  was  alive  today ,COMMA he  would  be  asking  statisticians  such  as  myself  to  go  out  and  find  out  what  makes  life  worthwhile .PERIOD he'd  be  asking  us  to  redesign  our  national  accounting  system  to  be  based  upon  such  important  things  as  social  justice ,COMMA sustainability  and  people  's  well-being .PERIOD and  actually ,COMMA social  scientists  have  already  gone  out  and  asked  these  questions  around  the  world .PERIOD this  is  from  a  global  survey .PERIOD it  's  asking  people ,COMMA what  do  they  want .PERIOD and  unsurprisingly ,COMMA people  all  around  the  world  say  that  what  they  want  is  happiness ,COMMA for  themselves ,COMMA for  their  families ,COMMA their  children ,COMMA their  communities .PERIOD okay ,COMMA they  think  money  is  slightly  important .PERIOD it  's  there ,COMMA but  it  's  not  nearly  as  important  as  happiness ,COMMA and  it  's  not  nearly  as  important  as  love .PERIOD we  all  need  to  love  and  be  loved  in  life .PERIOD it  's  not  nearly  as  important  as  health .PERIOD we  want  to  be  healthy  and  live  a  full  life .PERIOD these  seem  to  be  natural  human  aspirations .PERIOD why  are  statisticians  not  measuring  these ?QUESTIONMARK why  are  we  not  thinking  of  the  progress  of  nations  in  these  terms ,COMMA instead  of  just  how  much  stuff  we  have ?QUESTIONMARK and  really ,COMMA this  is  what  i've  done  with  my  adult  life ,COMMA is  think  about  how  do  we  measure  happiness ,COMMA how  do  we  measure  well-being ,COMMA how  can  we  do  that  within  environmental  limits .PERIOD and  we  created ,COMMA at  the  organization  that  i  work  for ,COMMA the  new  economics  foundation ,COMMA something  we  call  the  happy  planet  index ,COMMA because  we  think  people  should  be  happy  and  the  planet  should  be  happy .PERIOD why  do  n't  we  create  a  measure  of  progress  that  shows  that ?QUESTIONMARK and  what  we  do ,COMMA is  we  say  that  the  ultimate  outcome  of  a  nation  is  how  successful  is  it  at  creating  happy  and  healthy  lives  for  its  citizens .PERIOD that  should  be  the  goal  of  every  nation  on  the  planet .PERIOD but  we  have  to  remember  that  there  's  a  fundamental  input  to  that ,COMMA and  that  is  how  many  of  the  planet  's  resources  we  use .PERIOD we  all  have  one  planet .PERIOD we  all  have  to  share  it .PERIOD it  is  the  ultimate  scarce  resource ,COMMA the  one  planet  that  we  share .PERIOD and  economics  is  very  interested  in  scarcity .PERIOD when  it  has  a  scarce  resource  that  it  wants  to  turn  into  a  desirable  outcome ,COMMA it  thinks  in  terms  of  efficiency .PERIOD it  thinks  in  terms  of  how  much  bang  do  we  get  for  our  buck .PERIOD and  this  is  a  measure  of  how  much  well-being  we  get  for  our  planetary  resource  use .PERIOD it  is  an  efficiency  measure .PERIOD and  probably  the  easiest  way  to  show  you  that ,COMMA is  to  show  you  this  graph .PERIOD running  horizontally  along  the  graph ,COMMA is  ecological  footprint ,COMMA which  is  a  measure  of  how  much  resources  we  use  and  how  much  pressure  we  put  on  the  planet .PERIOD more  is  bad .PERIOD running  vertically  upwards ,COMMA is  a  measure  called  happy  life  years  it  's  about  the  well-being  of  nations .PERIOD it  's  like  a  happiness  adjusted  life-expectancy .PERIOD it  's  like  quality  and  quantity  of  life  in  nations .PERIOD and  the  yellow  dot  there  you  see ,COMMA is  the  global  average .PERIOD now ,COMMA there  's  a  huge  array  of  nations  around  that  global  average .PERIOD to  the  top  right  of  the  graph ,COMMA are  countries  which  are  doing  reasonably  well  and  producing  well-being ,COMMA but  they  're  using  a  lot  of  planet  to  get  there .PERIOD they  are  the  usa ,COMMA other  western  countries  going  across  in  those  triangles  and  a  few  gulf  states  in  there  actually .PERIOD conversely ,COMMA at  the  bottom  left  of  the  graph ,COMMA are  countries  that  are  not  producing  much  well-being ,COMMA typically ,COMMA sub-saharan  africa .PERIOD in  hobbesian  terms ,COMMA life  is  short  and  brutish  there .PERIOD the  average  life  expectancy  in  many  of  these  countries  is  only  40  years .PERIOD malaria ,COMMA hiv/aids  are  killing  a  lot  of  people  in  these  regions  of  the  world .PERIOD but  now  for  the  good  news .PERIOD there  are  some  countries  up  there ,COMMA yellow  triangles ,COMMA that  are  doing  better  than  global  average ,COMMA that  are  heading  up  towards  the  top  left  of  the  graph .PERIOD this  is  an  aspirational  graph .PERIOD we  want  to  be  top  left ,COMMA where  good  lives  do  n't  cost  the  earth .PERIOD they  're  latin  american .PERIOD the  country  on  its  own  up  at  the  top  is  a  place  i  have  n't  been  to .PERIOD maybe  some  of  you  have .PERIOD costa  rica .PERIOD costa  rica ,COMMA average  life  expectancy  is  78-and-a-half  years .PERIOD that  is  longer  than  in  the  usa .PERIOD they  are ,COMMA according  to  the  latest  gallup  world  poll ,COMMA the  happiest  nation  on  the  planet ,COMMA than  anybody .PERIOD more  than  switzerland  and  denmark .PERIOD they  are  the  happiest  place .PERIOD they  are  doing  that  on  a  quarter  of  the  resources  that  are  used  typically  in  the  western  world ,COMMA a  quarter  of  the  resources .PERIOD what  's  going  on  there ?QUESTIONMARK what  's  happening  in  costa  rica ?QUESTIONMARK we  can  look  at  some  of  the  data .PERIOD 99  percent  of  their  electricity  comes  from  renewable  resources .PERIOD their  government  is  one  of  the  first  to  commit  to  be  carbon  neutral  by  2021 .PERIOD they  abolished  the  army  in  1949 ,COMMA 1949 .PERIOD and  they  invested  in  social  programs ,COMMA health  and  education .PERIOD they  have  one  of  the  highest  literacy  rates  in  latin  america  and  in  the  world .PERIOD and  they  have  that  latin  vibe ,COMMA do  n't  they .PERIOD they  have  the  social  connectedness .PERIOD the  challenge  is ,COMMA that  possibly ,COMMA and  the  thing  we  might  have  to  think  about ,COMMA is  that  the  future  might  not  be  north  american ,COMMA might  not  be  western  european .PERIOD it  might  be  latin  american .PERIOD and  the  challenge ,COMMA really ,COMMA is  to  pull  the  global  average  up  here .PERIOD that  's  what  we  need  to  do .PERIOD and  if  we  're  going  to  do  that ,COMMA we  need  to  pull  countries  from  the  bottom ,COMMA and  we  need  to  pull  countries  from  the  right  of  the  graph .PERIOD and  then  we  're  starting  to  create  a  happy  planet .PERIOD that  's  one  way  of  looking  at  it .PERIOD another  way  of  looking  at  it  is  looking  at  time  trends .PERIOD we  do  n't  have  good  data  going  back  for  every  country  in  the  world ,COMMA but  for  some  of  the  richest  countries ,COMMA the  oecd  group ,COMMA we  do .PERIOD and  this  is  the  trend  in  well-being  over  that  time ,COMMA a  small  increase ,COMMA but  this  is  the  trend  in  ecological  footprint .PERIOD and  so  in  strict  happy-planet  methodology ,COMMA we've  become  less  efficient  at  turning  our  ultimate  scarce  resource  into  the  outcome  we  want  to .PERIOD and  the  point  really  is ,COMMA is  that  i  think ,COMMA probably  everybody  in  this  room  would  like  society  to  get  to  2050  without  an  apocalyptic  something  happening .PERIOD it  's  actually  not  very  long  away .PERIOD it  's  half  a  human  lifetime  away .PERIOD a  child  entering  school  today  will  be  my  age  in  2050 .PERIOD this  is  not  the  very  distant  future .PERIOD this  is  what  the  uk .PERIOD government  target  on  carbon  and  greenhouse  emissions  looks  like .PERIOD and  i  put  it  to  you ,COMMA that  is  not  business  as  usual .PERIOD that  is  changing  our  business .PERIOD that  is  changing  the  way  we  create  our  organizations ,COMMA we  do  our  government  policy  and  we  live  our  lives .PERIOD and  the  point  is ,COMMA we  need  to  carry  on  increasing  well-being .PERIOD no  one  can  go  to  the  polls  and  say  that  quality  of  life  is  going  to  reduce .PERIOD none  of  us ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA want  human  progress  to  stop .PERIOD i  think  we  want  it  to  carry  on .PERIOD i  think  we  want  the  lot  of  humanity  to  keep  on  increasing .PERIOD and  i  think  this  is  where  climate  change  skeptics  and  deniers  come  in .PERIOD i  think  this  is  what  they  want .PERIOD they  want  quality  of  life  to  keep  increasing .PERIOD they  want  to  hold  on  to  what  they've  got .PERIOD and  if  we  're  going  to  engage  them ,COMMA i  think  that  's  what  we've  got  to  do .PERIOD and  that  means  we  have  to  really  increase  efficiency  even  more .PERIOD now  that  's  all  very  easy  to  draw  graphs  and  things  like  that ,COMMA but  the  point  is  we  need  to  turn  those  curves .PERIOD and  this  is  where  i  think  we  can  take  a  leaf  out  of  systems  theory ,COMMA systems  engineers ,COMMA where  they  create  feedback  loops ,COMMA put  the  right  information  at  the  right  point  of  time .PERIOD human  beings  are  very  motivated  by  the  now .PERIOD you  put  a  smart  meter  in  your  home ,COMMA and  you  see  how  much  electricity  you  're  using  right  now ,COMMA how  much  it  's  costing  you ,COMMA your  kids  go  around  and  turn  the  lights  off  pretty  quickly .PERIOD what  would  that  look  like  for  society ?QUESTIONMARK why  is  it ,COMMA on  the  radio  news  every  evening ,COMMA i  hear  the  ftse  100 ,COMMA the  dow  jones ,COMMA the  dollar  pound  ratio ,COMMA i  do  n't  even  know  which  way  the  dollar  pound  ratio  should  go  to  be  good  news .PERIOD and  why  do  i  hear  that ?QUESTIONMARK why  do  n't  i  hear  how  much  energy  britain  used  yesterday ,COMMA or  american  used  yesterday ?QUESTIONMARK did  we  meet  our  three  percent  annual  target  on  reducing  carbon  emissions ?QUESTIONMARK that  's  how  you  create  a  collective  goal .PERIOD you  put  it  out  there  into  the  media  and  start  thinking  about  it .PERIOD and  we  need  positive  feedback  loops  for  increasing  well-being .PERIOD at  a  government  level ,COMMA they  might  create  national  accounts  of  well-being .PERIOD at  a  business  level ,COMMA you  might  look  at  the  well-being  of  your  employees ,COMMA which  we  know  is  really  linked  to  creativity ,COMMA which  is  linked  to  innovation ,COMMA and  we  're  going  to  need  a  lot  of  innovation  to  deal  with  those  environmental  issues .PERIOD at  a  personal  level ,COMMA we  need  these  nudges  too .PERIOD maybe  we  do  n't  quite  need  the  data ,COMMA but  we  need  reminders .PERIOD in  the  uk ,COMMA we  have  a  strong  public  health  message  on  five  fruit  and  vegetables  a  day  and  how  much  exercise  we  should  do ,COMMA never  my  best  thing .PERIOD what  are  these  for  happiness ?QUESTIONMARK what  are  the  five  things  that  you  should  do  every  day  to  be  happier ?QUESTIONMARK we  did  a  project  for  the  government  office  of  science  a  couple  of  years  ago ,COMMA a  big  program  called  the  foresight  program ,COMMA lots  and  lots  of  people ,COMMA involved  lots  of  experts ,COMMA everything  evidence  based ,COMMA a  huge  tome .PERIOD but  a  piece  of  work  we  did  was  on ,COMMA what  five  positive  actions  can  you  do  to  improve  well-being  in  your  life ?QUESTIONMARK and  the  point  of  these  is  they  are ,COMMA not  quite ,COMMA the  secrets  of  happiness ,COMMA but  they  are  things  that  i  think  happiness  will  flow  out  the  side  from .PERIOD and  the  first  of  these  is  to  connect ,COMMA is  that  your  social  relationships  are  the  most  important  cornerstones  of  your  life .PERIOD do  you  invest  the  time  with  your  loved  ones  that  you  could  do ,COMMA and  energy ?QUESTIONMARK keep  building  them .PERIOD the  second  one  is  be  active .PERIOD the  fastest  way  out  of  a  bad  mood ,COMMA step  outside ,COMMA go  for  a  walk ,COMMA turn  the  radio  on  and  dance .PERIOD being  active  is  great  for  our  positive  mood .PERIOD the  third  one  is  take  notice .PERIOD how  aware  are  you  of  things  going  on  around  the  world ,COMMA the  seasons  changing ,COMMA people  around  you ?QUESTIONMARK do  you  notice  what  's  bubbling  up  for  you  and  trying  to  emerge ?QUESTIONMARK based  on  a  lot  of  evidence  for  mindfulness ,COMMA cognitive  behavioral  therapy ,COMMA very  strong  for  our  well  being .PERIOD the  fourth  is  keep  learning  and  keep  is  important ,COMMA learning  throughout  the  whole  life  course .PERIOD older  people  who  keep  learning  and  are  curious ,COMMA they  have  much  better  health  outcomes  than  those  who  start  to  close  down .PERIOD but  it  does  n't  have  to  be  formal  learning .PERIOD it  's  not  knowledge  based .PERIOD it  's  more  curiosity .PERIOD it  can  be  learning  to  cook  a  new  dish ,COMMA picking  up  an  instrument  you  forgot  as  a  child .PERIOD keep  learning .PERIOD and  the  final  one  is  that  most  anti-economic  of  activities ,COMMA but  give .PERIOD our  generosity ,COMMA our  altruism ,COMMA our  compassion ,COMMA are  all  hardwired  to  the  reward  mechanism  in  our  brain .PERIOD we  feel  good  if  we  give .PERIOD you  can  do  an  experiment  where  you  give  two  groups  of  people  a  hundred  dollars  in  the  morning .PERIOD you  tell  one  of  them  to  spend  it  on  themselves  and  one  on  other  people .PERIOD you  measure  their  happiness  at  the  end  of  the  day ,COMMA those  that  have  gone  and  spent  on  other  people  are  much  happier  that  those  that  spent  it  on  themselves .PERIOD and  these  five  ways ,COMMA which  we  put  onto  these  handy  postcards ,COMMA i  would  say ,COMMA do  n't  have  to  cost  the  earth .PERIOD they  do  n't  have  any  carbon  content .PERIOD they  do  n't  need  a  lot  of  material  goods  to  be  satisfied .PERIOD and  so  i  think  it  's  really  quite  feasible  that  happiness  does  not  cost  the  earth .PERIOD now ,COMMA martin  luther  king ,COMMA on  the  eve  of  his  death ,COMMA gave  an  incredible  speech .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA i  know  there  are  challenges  ahead ,COMMA there  may  be  trouble  ahead ,COMMA but  i  fear  no  one .PERIOD i  do  n't  care .PERIOD i  have  been  to  the  mountain  top ,COMMA and  i  have  seen  the  promised  land .PERIOD now ,COMMA he  was  a  preacher ,COMMA but  i  believe  the  environmental  movement  and ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA the  business  community ,COMMA government ,COMMA needs  to  go  to  the  top  of  the  mountain  top ,COMMA and  it  needs  to  look  out ,COMMA and  it  needs  to  see  the  promised  land ,COMMA or  the  land  of  promise ,COMMA and  it  needs  to  have  a  vision  of  a  world  that  we  all  want .PERIOD and  not  only  that ,COMMA we  need  to  create  a  great  transition  to  get  there ,COMMA and  we  need  to  pave  that  great  transition  with  good  things .PERIOD human  beings  want  to  be  happy .PERIOD pave  them  with  the  five  ways .PERIOD and  we  need  to  have  signposts  gathering  people  together  and  pointing  them ,COMMA something  like  the  happy  planet  index .PERIOD and  then  i  believe  that  we  can  all  create  a  world  we  all  want ,COMMA where  happiness  does  not  cost  the  earth .PERIOD so  i  work  in  marketing ,COMMA which  i  love ,COMMA but  my  first  passion  was  physics ,COMMA a  passion  brought  to  me  by  a  wonderful  school  teacher ,COMMA when  i  had  a  little  less  gray  hair .PERIOD so  he  taught  me  that  physics  is  cool  because  it  teaches  us  so  much  about  the  world  around  us .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  spend  the  next  few  minutes  trying  to  convince  you  that  physics  can  teach  us  something  about  marketing .PERIOD so  quick  show  of  hands ,COMMA who  studied  some  marketing  in  university ?QUESTIONMARK who  studied  some  physics  in  university ?QUESTIONMARK pretty  good .PERIOD and  at  school ?QUESTIONMARK okay ,COMMA lots  of  you .PERIOD so ,COMMA hopefully  this  will  bring  back  some  happy ,COMMA or  possibly  some  slightly  disturbing  memories .PERIOD so ,COMMA physics  and  marketing .PERIOD we  'll  start  with  something  very  simple ,COMMA newton  's  law ,COMMA the  force  equals  mass  times  acceleration  this  is  something  that  perhaps  turkish  airlines  should  have  studied  a  bit  more  carefully  before  they  ran  this  campaign .PERIOD but  if  we  rearrange  this  formula  quickly ,COMMA we  can  get  to  acceleration  equals  force  over  mass ,COMMA which  means  that  for  a  larger  particle ,COMMA a  larger  mass ,COMMA it  requires  more  force  to  change  its  direction .PERIOD it  's  the  same  with  brands: .PERIOD the  more  massive  a  brand ,COMMA the  more  baggage  it  has ,COMMA the  more  force  is  needed  to  change  its  positioning .PERIOD and  that  's  one  of  the  reasons  why  arthur  andersen  chose  to  launch  accenture  rather  than  try  to  persuade  the  world  that  andersen  's  could  stand  for  something  other  than  accountancy .PERIOD it  explains  why  hoover  found  it  very  difficult  to  persuade  the  world  that  it  was  more  than  vacuum  cleaners ,COMMA and  why  companies  like  unilever  and  p&ampg  keep  brands  separate ,COMMA like  ariel  and  pringles  and  dove  rather  than  having  one  giant  parent  brand .PERIOD so  the  physics  is  that  the  bigger  the  mass  of  an  object  the  more  force  is  needed  to  change  its  direction .PERIOD the  marketing  is ,COMMA the  bigger  a  brand ,COMMA the  more  difficult  it  is  to  reposition  it .PERIOD so  think  about  a  portfolio  of  brands  or  maybe  new  brands  for  new  ventures .PERIOD now ,COMMA who  remembers  heisenberg  's  uncertainty  principle ?QUESTIONMARK getting  a  little  more  technical  now .PERIOD so  this  says  that  it  's  impossible ,COMMA by  definition ,COMMA to  measure  exactly  the  state ,COMMA ie ,COMMA the  position ,COMMA and  the  momentum  of  a  particle ,COMMA because  the  act  of  measuring  it ,COMMA by  definition ,COMMA changes  it .PERIOD so  to  explain  that ,COMMA if  you've  got  an  elementary  particle  and  you  shine  a  light  on  it ,COMMA then  the  photon  of  light  has  momentum ,COMMA which  knocks  the  particle ,COMMA so  you  do  n't  know  where  it  was  before  you  looked  at  it .PERIOD by  measuring  it ,COMMA the  act  of  measurement  changes  it .PERIOD the  act  of  observation  changes  it .PERIOD it  's  the  same  in  marketing .PERIOD so  with  the  act  of  observing  consumers ,COMMA changes  their  behavior .PERIOD think  about  the  group  of  moms  who  are  talking  about  their  wonderful  children  in  a  focus  group ,COMMA and  almost  none  of  them  buy  lots  of  junk  food .PERIOD and  yet ,COMMA mcdonald  's  sells  hundreds  of  millions  of  burgers  every  year .PERIOD think  about  the  people  who  are  on  accompanied  shops  in  supermarkets ,COMMA who  stuff  their  trolleys  full  of  fresh  green  vegetables  and  fruit ,COMMA but  do  n't  shop  like  that  any  other  day .PERIOD and  if  you  think  about  the  number  of  people  who  claim  in  surveys  to  regularly  look  for  porn  on  the  web ,COMMA it  's  very  few .PERIOD yet ,COMMA at  google ,COMMA we  know  it  's  the  number-one  searched  for  category .PERIOD so  luckily ,COMMA the  science ,COMMA no ,COMMA sorry ,COMMA the  marketing  is  getting  easier .PERIOD luckily ,COMMA with  now  better  point-of-sale  tracking ,COMMA more  digital  media  consumption ,COMMA you  can  measure  more  what  consumers  actually  do ,COMMA rather  than  what  they  say  they  do .PERIOD so  the  physics  is  you  can  never  accurately  and  exactly  measure  a  particle ,COMMA because  the  observation  changes  it .PERIOD the  marketing  is ,COMMA the  message  for  marketing  is ,COMMA that  try  to  measure  what  consumers  actually  do ,COMMA rather  than  what  they  say  they  'll  do  or  anticipate  they  'll  do .PERIOD so  next ,COMMA the  scientific  method ,COMMA an  axiom  of  physics ,COMMA of  all  science ,COMMA says  you  cannot  prove  a  hypothesis  through  observation .PERIOD you  can  only  disprove  it .PERIOD what  this  means  is  you  can  gather  more  and  more  data  around  a  hypothesis  or  a  positioning ,COMMA and  it  will  strengthen  it ,COMMA but  it  will  not  conclusively  prove  it .PERIOD and  only  one  contrary  data  point  can  blow  your  theory  out  of  the  water .PERIOD so  if  we  take  an  example ,COMMA ptolemy  had  dozens  of  data  points  to  support  his  theory  that  the  planets  would  rotate  around  the  earth .PERIOD it  only  took  one  robust  observation  from  copernicus  to  blow  that  idea  out  of  the  water .PERIOD and  there  are  parallels  for  marketing  -- .PERIOD you  can  invest  for  a  long  time  in  a  brand ,COMMA but  a  single  contrary  observation  of  that  positioning  will  destroy  consumers  belief .PERIOD take  bp  -- .PERIOD they  spent  millions  of  pounds  over  many  years  building  up  its  credentials  as  an  environmentally  friendly  brand ,COMMA but  then  one  little  accident .PERIOD think  about  toyota .PERIOD it  was ,COMMA for  a  long  time ,COMMA revered  as  the  most  reliable  of  cars ,COMMA and  then  they  had  the  big  recall  incident .PERIOD and  tiger  woods ,COMMA for  a  long  time ,COMMA the  perfect  brand  ambassador .PERIOD well ,COMMA you  know  the  story .PERIOD so  the  physics  is  that  you  cannot  prove  a  hypothesis ,COMMA but  it  's  easy  to  disprove  it  -- .PERIOD any  hypothesis  is  shaky .PERIOD and  the  marketing  is  that  not  matter  how  much  you've  invested  in  your  brand ,COMMA one  bad  week  can  undermine  decades  of  good  work .PERIOD so  be  really  careful  to  try  and  avoid  the  screw-ups  that  can  undermine  your  brand .PERIOD and  lastly ,COMMA to  the  slightly  obscure  world  of  entropy ,COMMA the  second  law  of  thermodynamics .PERIOD this  says  that  entropy ,COMMA which  is  a  measure  of  the  disorder  of  a  system ,COMMA will  always  increase .PERIOD the  same  is  true  of  marketing .PERIOD if  we  go  back  20  years ,COMMA the  one  message  pretty  much  controlled  by  one  marketing  manager  could  pretty  much  define  a  brand .PERIOD but  where  we  are  today ,COMMA things  have  changed .PERIOD you  can  get  a  strong  brand  image  or  a  message  and  put  it  out  there  like  the  conservative  party  did  earlier  this  year  with  their  election  poster .PERIOD but  then  you  lose  control  of  it .PERIOD with  the  kind  of  digital  comment  creation  and  distribution  tools  that  are  available  now  to  every  consumer ,COMMA it  's  impossible  to  control  where  it  goes .PERIOD your  brand  starts  being  dispersed .PERIOD it  gets  more  chaotic .PERIOD it  's  out  of  your  control .PERIOD i  actually  saw  him  speak ,COMMA he  did  a  good  job .PERIOD but  while  this  may  be  unsettling  for  marketers ,COMMA it  's  actually  a  good  thing .PERIOD this  distribution  of  brand  energy  gets  your  brand  closer  to  the  people ,COMMA more  in  with  the  people .PERIOD it  makes  this  distribution  of  energy  a  democratizing  force ,COMMA which  is  ultimately  good  for  your  brand .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  lesson  from  physics  is  that  entropy  will  always  increase .PERIOD it  's  a  fundamental  law .PERIOD the  message  for  marketing  is  that  your  brand  is  more  dispersed .PERIOD you  cannot  fight  it ,COMMA so  embrace  it  and  find  a  way  to  work  with  it .PERIOD so  to  close ,COMMA my  teacher ,COMMA mr.  vutter ,COMMA told  me  that  physics  is  cool ,COMMA and  hopefully ,COMMA i've  convinced  you  that  physics  can  teach  all  of  us ,COMMA even  in  the  world  of  marketing ,COMMA something  special .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD as  you  pointed  out ,COMMA every  time  you  come  here ,COMMA you  learn  something .PERIOD this  morning ,COMMA the  world  's  experts  from  i  guess  three  or  four  different  companies  on  building  seats ,COMMA i  think  concluded  that  ultimately ,COMMA the  solution  is ,COMMA people  should  n't  sit  down .PERIOD i  could  have  told  them  that .PERIOD yesterday ,COMMA the  automotive  guys  gave  us  some  new  insights .PERIOD they  pointed  out  that ,COMMA i  believe  it  was  between  30  and  50  years  from  today ,COMMA they  will  be  steering  cars  by  wire ,COMMA without  all  that  mechanical  stuff .PERIOD that  's  reassuring .PERIOD they  then  pointed  out  that  there'd  be ,COMMA sort  of ,COMMA the  other  controls  by  wire ,COMMA to  get  rid  of  all  that  mechanical  stuff .PERIOD that  's  pretty  good ,COMMA but  why  not  get  rid  of  the  wires ?QUESTIONMARK then  you  do  n't  need  anything  to  control  the  car ,COMMA except  thinking  about  it .PERIOD i  would  love  to  talk  about  the  technology ,COMMA and  sometime ,COMMA in  what  's  past  the  15  minutes ,COMMA i  'll  be  happy  to  talk  to  all  the  techno-geeks  around  here  about  what  's  in  here .PERIOD but  if  i  had  one  thing  to  say  about  this ,COMMA before  we  get  to  first ,COMMA it  would  be  that  from  the  time  we  started  building  this ,COMMA the  big  idea  was  n't  the  technology .PERIOD it  really  was  a  big  idea  in  technology  when  we  started  applying  it  in  the  ibot  for  the  disabled  community .PERIOD the  big  idea  here  is ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA a  new  piece  of  a  solution  to  a  fairly  big  problem  in  transportation .PERIOD and  maybe  to  put  that  in  perspective ,COMMA there  's  so  much  data  on  this ,COMMA i  'll  be  happy  to  give  it  to  you  in  different  forms .PERIOD you  never  know  what  strikes  the  fancy  of  whom ,COMMA but  everybody  is  perfectly  willing  to  believe  the  car  changed  the  world .PERIOD and  henry  ford ,COMMA just  about  100  years  ago ,COMMA started  cranking  out  model  ts .PERIOD what  i  do  n't  think  most  people  think  about  is  the  context  of  how  technology  is  applied .PERIOD for  instance ,COMMA in  that  time ,COMMA 91  percent  of  america  lived  either  on  farms  or  in  small  towns .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  car ,COMMA the  horseless  carriage  that  replaced  the  horse  and  carriage ,COMMA was  a  big  deal .PERIOD it  went  twice  as  fast  as  a  horse  and  carriage .PERIOD it  was  half  as  long .PERIOD and  it  was  an  environmental  improvement ,COMMA because ,COMMA for  instance ,COMMA in  1903  they  outlawed  horses  and  buggies  in  downtown  manhattan ,COMMA because  you  can  imagine  what  the  roads  look  like  when  you  have  a  million  horses ,COMMA and  a  million  of  them  urinating  and  doing  other  things ,COMMA and  the  typhoid  and  other  problems  created  were  almost  unimaginable .PERIOD so  the  car  was  the  clean  environmental  alternative  to  a  horse  and  buggy .PERIOD it  also  was  a  way  for  people  to  get  from  their  farm  to  a  farm ,COMMA or  their  farm  to  a  town ,COMMA or  from  a  town  to  a  city .PERIOD it  all  made  sense ,COMMA with  91  percent  of  the  people  living  there .PERIOD by  the  1950s ,COMMA we  started  connecting  all  the  towns  together  with  what  a  lot  of  people  claim  is  the  eighth  wonder  of  the  world ,COMMA the  highway  system .PERIOD and  it  is  certainly  a  wonder .PERIOD and  by  the  way ,COMMA as  i  take  shots  at  old  technologies ,COMMA i  want  to  assure  everybody ,COMMA and  particularly  the  automotive  industry ,COMMA who  's  been  very  supportive  of  us ,COMMA that  i  do  n't  think  this  in  any  way  competes  with  airplanes ,COMMA or  cars .PERIOD but  think  about  where  the  world  is  today .PERIOD 50  percent  of  the  global  population  now  lives  in  cities .PERIOD that  's  32  billion  people .PERIOD we've  solved  all  the  transportation  problems  that  have  changed  the  world  to  get  it  to  where  we  are  today .PERIOD 500  years  ago ,COMMA sailing  ships  started  getting  reliable  enough .PERIOD we  found  a

,COMMA we  started  building  cars ,COMMA and  then  over  the  50  years  we've  connected  every  city  to  every  other  city  in  an  extraordinarily  efficient  way ,COMMA and  we  have  a  very  high  standard  of  living  as  a  consequence  of  that .PERIOD but  during  that  entire  process ,COMMA more  and  more  people  have  been  born ,COMMA and  more  and  more  people  are  moving  to  cities .PERIOD china  alone  is  going  to  move  four  to  six  hundred  million  people  into  cities  in  the  next  decade  and  a  half .PERIOD and  so ,COMMA nobody ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA would  argue  that  airplanes ,COMMA in  the  last  50  years ,COMMA have  turned  the  continent  and  the  country  now  into  a  neighborhood .PERIOD and  if  you  just  look  at  how  technology

are  extraordinarily  efficient ,COMMA both  from  an  engineering  point  of  view ,COMMA an  energy  consumption  point  of  view ,COMMA and  a  utility  point  of  view .PERIOD and  we  all  love

not  sustainable .PERIOD if ,COMMA in  china ,COMMA in  the  year  1998 ,COMMA 417  million  people  used  bicycles .PERIOD 17  million  people  used  cars .PERIOD if  five  percent  of  that

,COMMA but  what  's  the  world  fighting  over  right  now ?QUESTIONMARK so  it  seemed  to  me  that  somebody  had  to  work  on  that  last  mile ,COMMA and  it  was  dumb  luck .PERIOD we  were  working  on  ibots .PERIOD but  once  we  made  this ,COMMA we  instantly  decided  it  could  be  a  great  alternative  to  jet  skis .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  the  water .PERIOD or  snowmobiles .PERIOD you  do  n't  need  the  snow .PERIOD or  skiing .PERIOD it  's  just  fun ,COMMA and  people  love  to  move  around  doing  fun  things .PERIOD and  every  one  of  those  industries ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA just  golf  carts  alone  is  a  multi-billion-dollar  industry .PERIOD but  rather  than  go  license  this  off ,COMMA which  is  what  we  normally  do ,COMMA it  seemed  to  me  that  if  we  put  all  our  effort  not  into  the  technology ,COMMA but  into  an  understanding  of  a  world  that  's  solved  all  its  other  problems ,COMMA but  has  somehow  come  to  accept  that  cities ,COMMA which ,COMMA right  back  from  ancient  greece  on ,COMMA were  meant  to  walk  around ,COMMA cities  that  were  architected  and  built  for  people ,COMMA now  have  a  footprint  that ,COMMA while  we've  solved  every  other  transportation  problem ,COMMA and  it  's  like  moore  's  law .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA look  at  the  time  it  took  to  cross  a

between  cities ?QUESTIONMARK what  if  you  could  make  them  fun ,COMMA attractive ,COMMA clean ,COMMA environmentally  friendly ?QUESTIONMARK what  if  it  would  make  it  a  little  bit  more  palatable  to  have  access  via  this ,COMMA as  that  last  link  to  mass  transit ,COMMA to  get  out  to  your  cars  so  we  can  all  live  in  the  suburbs  and  use  our  cars  the  way  we  want ,COMMA and  then  have  our  cities  energized  again ?QUESTIONMARK we  thought  it  would  be  really  neat  to  do  that ,COMMA and  one  of  the  problems  we  really  were  worried  about  is ,COMMA how  do  we  get  legal  on  the  sidewalk ?QUESTIONMARK because  technically  i've  got  motors .PERIOD i've  got  wheels ,COMMA i  'm  a  motor  vehicle .PERIOD i  do  n't  look  like  a  motor  vehicle .PERIOD i  have  the  same  footprint  as  a  pedestrian .PERIOD i  have  the  same  unique  capability  to  deal  with  other  pedestrians  in  a  crowded  space .PERIOD i  took  this  down  to  ground  zero ,COMMA and  knocked  my  way  through  crowds  for  an  hour .PERIOD i  'm  a  pedestrian .PERIOD but  the  law  typically  lags  technology  by  a  generation  or  two ,COMMA and  if  we  get  told  we  do  n't  belong  on  the  sidewalk ,COMMA we  have  two  choices .PERIOD we  're  a  recreational  vehicle  that  does  n't  really  matter ,COMMA and  i  do  n't  spend  my  time  doing  that  kind  of  stuff .PERIOD or  maybe  we  should  be  out  in  the  street  in  front  of  a  greyhound  bus  or  a  vehicle .PERIOD we've  been  so  concerned  about  that ,COMMA we  went  to  the  postmaster  general  of  the  united  states ,COMMA as  the  first  person  we  ever  showed  on  the  outside ,COMMA and  said ,COMMA put  your  people  on  it .PERIOD everybody  trusts  their  postman .PERIOD and  they  belong  on  the  sidewalks ,COMMA and  they  'll  use  it  seriously .PERIOD he  agreed .PERIOD we  went  to  a  number  of  police  departments  that  want  their  police  officers  back  in  the  neighborhood  on  the  beat ,COMMA carrying  70  pounds  of  stuff .PERIOD they  love  it .PERIOD and  i  cannot  believe  a  policeman  is  going  to  give  themselves  a  ticket .PERIOD so  we've  been  working  really ,COMMA really  hard ,COMMA but  we  knew  that  the  technology  would  not  be  as  hard  to  develop  as  an  attitude  about  what  's  important ,COMMA and  how  to  apply  the  technology .PERIOD we  went  out  and  we  found  some  visionary  people  with  enough  money  to  let  us  design  and  build  these  things ,COMMA and  in  hopefully  enough  time  to  get  them  accepted .PERIOD so ,COMMA i  'm  happy ,COMMA really ,COMMA i  am  happy  to  talk  about  this  technology  as  much  as  you  want .PERIOD and  yes ,COMMA it  's  really  fun ,COMMA and  yes ,COMMA you  should  all  go  out  and  try  it .PERIOD but  if  i  could  ask  you  to  do  one  thing ,COMMA it  's  not  to  think  about  it  as  a  piece  of  technology ,COMMA but  just  imagine  that ,COMMA although  we  all  understand  somehow  that  it  's  reasonable  that  we  use  our  4,000-pound  machine ,COMMA which  can  go  60  miles  an  hour ,COMMA that  can  bring  you  everywhere  you  want  to  go ,COMMA and  somehow  it  's  also  what  we  used  for  the  last  mile ,COMMA and  it  's  broken ,COMMA and  it  does  n't  work .PERIOD one  of  the  more  exciting  things  that  occurred  to  us  about  why  it  might  get  accepted ,COMMA happened  out  here  in  california .PERIOD a  few  weeks  ago ,COMMA after  we  launched  it ,COMMA we  were  here  with  a  news  crew  on  venice  beach ,COMMA zipping  up  and  back ,COMMA and  he  's  marveling  at  the  technology ,COMMA and  meanwhile  bicycles  are  zipping  by ,COMMA and  skateboarders  are  zipping  by ,COMMA and  a  little  old  lady ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA if  you  looked  in  the  dictionary ,COMMA a  little  old  lady ,COMMA came  by  me ,COMMA and  now  that  i  'm  on  this ,COMMA i  'm  the  height  of  a  normal  adult  now ,COMMA and  she  just  stops ,COMMA and  the  camera  is  there ,COMMA and  she  looks  up  at  me  and  says ,COMMA can  i  try  that ?QUESTIONMARK and  what  was  i ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA how  are  you  going  to  say  anything ?QUESTIONMARK and  so  i  said ,COMMA sure .PERIOD so  i  get  off ,COMMA and  she  gets  on ,COMMA and  with  a  little  bit  of  the  usual ,COMMA ah ,COMMA then  she  turns  around ,COMMA and  she  goes  about  20  feet ,COMMA and  she  turns  back  around ,COMMA and  she  's  all  smiles .PERIOD and  she  comes  back  to  me  and  she  stops ,COMMA and  she  says ,COMMA finally ,COMMA they  made  something  for  us .PERIOD and  the  camera  is  looking  down  at  her .PERIOD i  'm  thinking ,COMMA wow ,COMMA that  was  great ,COMMA please  lady ,COMMA do  n't  say  another  word .PERIOD and  the  camera  is  down  at  her ,COMMA and  this  guy  has  to  put  the  microphone  in  her  face ,COMMA said ,COMMA what  do  you  mean  by  that ?QUESTIONMARK and  i  figured ,COMMA it  's  all  over  now ,COMMA and  she  looks  up  and  she  says ,COMMA well ,COMMA she  's  still  watching  these  guys  go .PERIOD she  says ,COMMA i  cannot  ride  a  bike ,COMMA no ,COMMA she  says ,COMMA i  cannot  use  a  skateboard ,COMMA and  i've  never  used  roller  blades ,COMMA she  knew  them  by  name .PERIOD she  says ,COMMA and  it  's  been  50  years  since  i  rode  a  bicycle .PERIOD then  she  looks  up ,COMMA she  's  looking  up ,COMMA and  she  says ,COMMA and  i  'm  81  years  old ,COMMA and  i  do  n't  drive  a  car  anymore .PERIOD i  still  have  to  get  to  the  store ,COMMA and  i  cannot  carry  a  lot  of  things .PERIOD and  it  suddenly  occurred  to  me ,COMMA that  among  my  many  fears ,COMMA were  not  just  that  the  bureaucracy  and  the  regulators  and  the  legislators  might  not  get  it ,COMMA it  was  that ,COMMA fundamentally ,COMMA you  believe  there  's  pressure  among  the  people  not  to  invade  the  most  precious  little  bit  of  space  left ,COMMA the  sidewalks  in  these  cities .PERIOD when  you  look  at  the  36  inches  of  legal  requirement  for  sidewalk ,COMMA then  the  eight  foot  for  the  parked  car ,COMMA then  the  three  lanes ,COMMA and  then  the  other  eight  feet ,COMMA it  's ,COMMA that  little  piece  is  all  that  's  there .PERIOD but  she  looks  up  and  says  this ,COMMA and  it  occurs  to  me ,COMMA well ,COMMA kids  are  n't  going  to  mind  these  things ,COMMA and  they  do  n't  vote ,COMMA and  business  people  and  then  young  adults  are  n't  going  to  mind  these  things ,COMMA they  're  pretty  cool ,COMMA so  i  guess  subliminally  i  was  worried  that  it  's  the  older  population  that  's  going  to  worry .PERIOD so ,COMMA having  seen  this ,COMMA and  having  worried  about  it  for  eight  years ,COMMA the  first  thing  i  do  is  pick  up  my  phone  and  ask  our  marketing  and  regulatory  guys ,COMMA call  aarp ,COMMA get  an  appointment  right  away .PERIOD we've  got  to  show  them  this  thing .PERIOD and  they  took  it  to  washington .PERIOD they  showed  them .PERIOD and  they  're  going  to  be  involved  now ,COMMA watching  how  these  things  get  absorbed  in  a  number  of  cities ,COMMA like  atlanta ,COMMA where  we  're  doing  trials  to  see  if  it  really  can ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA help  re-energize  their  downtown .PERIOD the  bottom  line  is ,COMMA whether  you  believe  the  united  nations ,COMMA or  any  of  the  other  think  tanks ,COMMA in  the  next  20  years ,COMMA all  human  population  growth  on  this  planet  will  be  in  cities .PERIOD in

because  if  i  type  design  and  emotion ,COMMA it  says ,COMMA you  do  n't  need  the  and  we  do  it  anyway  so ,COMMA ok .PERIOD so  i  type  design  emotion  and  my  website  was  n't  first  again .PERIOD it  was  third .PERIOD oh  well ,COMMA different  story .PERIOD there  was  this  wonderful  review  in  the  new  york  times  about  the  mini  cooper  automobile .PERIOD it  said ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA this  is  a  car  that  has  lots  of  faults .PERIOD buy  it  anyway .PERIOD it  's  so  much  fun  to  drive .PERIOD and  if  you  look  at  the  inside  of  the  car ,COMMA i  mean ,COMMA i  loved  it ,COMMA i  wanted  to  see  it ,COMMA i  rented  it ,COMMA this  is  me  taking  a  picture  while  my  son  is  driving ,COMMA and  the  inside  of  the  car ,COMMA the  whole  design  is  fun .PERIOD it  's  round ,COMMA it  's  neat .PERIOD the  controls  work  wonderfully .PERIOD so  that  's  my  new  life .PERIOD it  's  all  about  fun .PERIOD i  really  have  the  feeling  that  pleasant  things  work  better ,COMMA and  that  never  made  any  sense  to  me  until  i  finally  figured  out ,COMMA look .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  put  a  plank  on  the  ground .PERIOD so ,COMMA imagine  i  have  a  plank  about  two  feet  wide  and  30  feet  long .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  walk  on  it ,COMMA and  you  see  i  can  walk  on  it  without  looking .PERIOD i  can  go  back  and  forth  and  i  can  jump  up  and  down .PERIOD no  problem .PERIOD now  i  'm  going  to  put  the  plank  300  feet  in  the  air  -- .PERIOD and  i  'm  not  going  to  go  near  it ,COMMA thank  you .PERIOD intense  fear  paralyzes  you .PERIOD it  actually  affects  the  way  the  brain  works .PERIOD so ,COMMA paul  saffo ,COMMA before  his  talk  said  that  he  did  n't  really  have  it  down  until  just  a  few  days  or  hours  before  the  talk ,COMMA and  that  anxiety  was  really  helpful  in  causing  him  to  focus .PERIOD that  's  what  fear  and  anxiety  does .PERIOD it  causes  you  to  be ,COMMA what  's  called  depth-first  processing ,COMMA to  focus ,COMMA not  be  distracted .PERIOD and  i  could  n't  force  myself  across  that .PERIOD now  some  people  can ,COMMA circus  workers ,COMMA steel  workers .PERIOD but  it  really  changes  the  way  you  think .PERIOD and  then ,COMMA a  psychologist ,COMMA alice  isen ,COMMA did  this  wonderful  experiment .PERIOD she  brought  students  in  to  solve  problems .PERIOD so ,COMMA she'd  bring  people  into  the  room ,COMMA and  there'd  be  a  string  hanging  down  here  and  a  string  hanging  down  here .PERIOD it  was  an  empty  room ,COMMA except  for  a  table  with  a  bunch  of  crap  on  it ,COMMA some  papers  and  scissors  and  stuff .PERIOD and  she'd  bring  them  in ,COMMA and  she'd  say ,COMMA this  is  an  iq  test  and  it  determines  how  well  you  do  in  life .PERIOD would  you  tie  those  two  strings  together ?QUESTIONMARK so  they'd  take  one  string  and  they'd  pull  it  over  here  and  they  could  n't  reach  the  other  string .PERIOD still  cannot  reach  it .PERIOD and ,COMMA basically ,COMMA none  of  them  could  solve  it .PERIOD you  bring  in  a  second  group  of  people ,COMMA and  you  say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA before  we  start ,COMMA i  got  this  box  of  candy ,COMMA and  i  do  n't  eat  candy .PERIOD would  you  like  the  box  of  candy ?QUESTIONMARK and  turns  out  they  liked  it ,COMMA and  it  made  them  happy  -- .PERIOD not  very  happy ,COMMA but  a  little  bit  of  happy .PERIOD and  guess  what ,COMMA they  solved  the  problem .PERIOD and  it  turns  out  that  when  you  're  anxious  you  squirt  neural  transmitters  in  the  brain ,COMMA which  focuses  you  makes  you  depth-first .PERIOD and  when  you  're  happy ,COMMA what  we  call  positive  valence ,COMMA you  squirt  dopamine  into  the  prefrontal  lobes ,COMMA which  makes  you  a  breadth-first  problem  solver ,COMMA you  're  more  susceptible  to  interruption .PERIOD you  do  out-of-the-box  thinking .PERIOD that  's  what  brainstorming  is  about ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK with  brainstorming  we  make  you  happy ,COMMA we  play  games ,COMMA and  we  say ,COMMA no  criticism ,COMMA and  you  get  all  these  weird ,COMMA neat  ideas .PERIOD but  in  fact ,COMMA if  that  's  how  you  always  were  you'd  never  get  any  work  done  because  you'd  be  working  along  and  say ,COMMA oh ,COMMA i  got  a  new  way  of  doing  it .PERIOD so  to  get  work  done ,COMMA you've  got  to  set  a  deadline ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK you've  got  be  anxious .PERIOD the  brain  works  differently  if  you  're  happy .PERIOD things  work  better  because  you  're  more  creative .PERIOD you  get  a  little  problem ,COMMA you  say ,COMMA ah ,COMMA i  'll  figure  it  out .PERIOD no  big  deal .PERIOD there  's  something  i  call  the  visceral  level  of  processing ,COMMA and  there  will  be  visceral-level  design .PERIOD biology ,COMMA we  have  co-adapted  through  biology  to  like  bright  colors .PERIOD that  's  especially  good  that  mammals  and  primates  like  fruits  and  bright  plants ,COMMA because  you  eat  the  fruit  and  you  thereby  spread  the  seed .PERIOD there  's  an  amazing  amount  of  stuff  that  's  built  into  the  brain .PERIOD we  dislike  bitter  tastes ,COMMA we  dislike  loud  sounds ,COMMA we  dislike  hot  temperatures ,COMMA cold  temperatures .PERIOD we  dislike  scolding  voices .PERIOD we  dislike  frowning  faces .PERIOD we  like  symmetrical  faces ,COMMA etc ,COMMA etc .PERIOD so  that  's  the  visceral  level .PERIOD in  design ,COMMA you  can  express  visceral  in  lots  of  ways ,COMMA like  the  choice  of  type  fonts  and  the  red  for  hot ,COMMA exciting .PERIOD or  the  1963  jaguar: .PERIOD it  's  actually  a  crummy  car ,COMMA falls  apart  all  the  time ,COMMA but  the  owners  love  it .PERIOD and  it  's  beautiful ,COMMA it  's  in  the  museum  of  modern  art .PERIOD a  water  bottle: .PERIOD you  buy  it  because  of  the  bottle ,COMMA not  because  of  the  water .PERIOD and  when  people  are  finished ,COMMA they  do  n't  throw  it  away .PERIOD they  keep  it  for ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA it  's  like  the  old  wine  bottles ,COMMA you  keep  it  for  decoration  or  maybe  fill  it  with  water  again ,COMMA which  proves  it  's  not  the  water .PERIOD it  's  all  about  the  visceral  experience .PERIOD the  middle  level  of  processing  is  the  behavioral  level  and  that  's  actually  where  most  of  our  stuff  gets  done .PERIOD visceral  is  subconscious ,COMMA you  're  unaware  of  it .PERIOD behavioral  is  subconscious ,COMMA you  're  unaware  of  it .PERIOD almost  everything  we  do  is  subconscious .PERIOD i  'm  walking  around  the  stage ,COMMA i  'm  not  attending  to  the  control  of  my  legs .PERIOD i  'm  doing  a  lot .PERIOD most  of  my  talk  is  subconscious .PERIOD it  has  been  rehearsed  and  thought  about  a  lot .PERIOD most  of  what  we  do  is  subconscious .PERIOD automatic  behavior ,COMMA skilled  behavior ,COMMA is  subconscious ,COMMA controlled  by  the  behavioral  side .PERIOD and  behavioral  design  is  all  about  feeling  in  control ,COMMA which  includes  usability ,COMMA understanding ,COMMA but  also  the  feel  and  heft .PERIOD that  's  why  the  global  knives  are  so  neat .PERIOD they  're  so  nicely  balanced ,COMMA so  sharp ,COMMA that  you  really  feel  you  're  in  control  of  the  cutting .PERIOD or ,COMMA just  driving  a  high-performance  sports  car  over  a  demanding  curb ,COMMA again ,COMMA feeling  that  you  are  in  complete  control  of  the  environment .PERIOD or  the  sensual  feeling .PERIOD this  is  a  kohler  shower ,COMMA a  waterfall  shower ,COMMA and  actually ,COMMA all  those  knobs  beneath  are  also  showerheads .PERIOD it  will  squirt  you  all  around  and  you  can  stay  in  that  shower  for  hours  -- .PERIOD and  not  waste  water ,COMMA by  the  way ,COMMA because  it  recirculates  the  same  dirty  water .PERIOD or  this ,COMMA this  is  a  really  neat  teapot  i  found  at  high  tea  at  the  four  seasons  hotel  in  chicago .PERIOD it  's  a  ronnefeldt  tilting  teapot .PERIOD that  's  kind  of  what  the  teapot  looks  like  but  the  way  you  use  it  is  you  lay  it  on  its  back ,COMMA and  you  put  tea  in ,COMMA and  then  you  fill  it  with  water .PERIOD the  water  then  seeps  over  the  tea .PERIOD and  the  tea  is  sitting  in  this  stuff  to  the  right ,COMMA the  tea  is  to  the  right  of  this  line .PERIOD there  's  a  little  ledge  inside ,COMMA so  the  tea  is  sitting  there  and  the  water  is  filling  it  up  like  that .PERIOD and  when  the  tea  is  ready ,COMMA or  almost  ready ,COMMA you  tilt  it .PERIOD and  that  means  the  tea  is  partially  covered  while  it  completes  the  brewing .PERIOD and  when  it  's  finished ,COMMA you  put  it  vertically ,COMMA and  now  the  tea  is ,COMMA you  remember ,COMMA above  this  line  and  the  water  only  comes  to  here ,COMMA and  so  it  keeps  the  tea  out .PERIOD on  top  of  that ,COMMA it  communicates ,COMMA which  is  what  emotion  does .PERIOD emotion  is  all  about  acting .PERIOD emotion  is  really  about  acting .PERIOD it  's  being  safe  in  the  world .PERIOD cognition  is  about  understanding  the  world ,COMMA emotion  is  about  interpreting  it ,COMMA saying  good ,COMMA bad ,COMMA safe ,COMMA dangerous ,COMMA and  getting  us  ready  to  act ,COMMA which  is  why  the  muscles  tense  or  relax .PERIOD and  that  's  why  we  can  tell  the  emotion  of  somebody  else ,COMMA because  their  muscles  are  acting ,COMMA subconsciously ,COMMA except  that  we've  evolved  to  make  the  facial  muscles  really  rich  with  emotion .PERIOD well ,COMMA this  has  emotions  if  you  like ,COMMA because  it  signals  the  waiter  that ,COMMA hey ,COMMA i  'm  finished .PERIOD see ,COMMA upright .PERIOD and  the  waiter  can  come  by  and  say ,COMMA would  you  like  more  water ?QUESTIONMARK it  's  kind  of  neat .PERIOD what  a  wonderful  design .PERIOD and  the  third  level  is  reflective ,COMMA which  is ,COMMA if  you  like  the  superego ,COMMA it  's  a  little  part  of  the  brain  that  has  no  control  over  what  you  do ,COMMA no  control  over  the ,COMMA does  n't  see  the  senses ,COMMA does  n't  control  the  muscles .PERIOD it  looks  over  what  's  going  on .PERIOD it  's  that  little  voice  in  your  head  that  's  watching  and  saying ,COMMA that  's  good .PERIOD that  's  bad .PERIOD or ,COMMA why  are  you  doing  that ?QUESTIONMARK i  do  n't  understand .PERIOD it  's  that  little  voice  in  your  head  that  's  the  seat  of  consciousness .PERIOD here  's  a  great  reflective  product .PERIOD owners  of  the  hummer  have  said ,COMMA you  know  i've  owned  many  cars  in  my  life ,COMMA all  sorts  of  exotic  cars ,COMMA but  never  have  i  had  a  car  that  attracted  so  much  attention .PERIOD it  's  about  attention .PERIOD it  's  about  their  image ,COMMA not  about  the  car .PERIOD if  you  want  a  more  positive  model ,COMMA this  is  the  gm  car .PERIOD and  the  reason  you  might  buy  it  now  is  because  you  care  about  the  environment .PERIOD and  you  'll  buy  it  to  protect  the  environment ,COMMA even  though  the  first  few  cars  are  going  to  be  really  expensive  and  not  perfected .PERIOD but  that  's  reflective  design  as  well .PERIOD or  an  expensive  watch ,COMMA so  you  can  impress  people ,COMMA oh  gee ,COMMA i  did  n't  know  you  had  that  watch .PERIOD as  opposed  to  this  one ,COMMA which  is  a  pure  behavioral  watch ,COMMA which  probably  keeps  better  time  than  the  $13,000  watch  i  just  showed  you .PERIOD but  it  's  ugly .PERIOD this  is  a  clear  don  norman  watch .PERIOD and  what  's  neat  is  sometimes  you  pit  one  emotion  against  the  other ,COMMA the  visceral  fear  of  falling  against  the  reflective  state  saying ,COMMA it  's  ok .PERIOD it  's  ok .PERIOD it  's  safe .PERIOD it  's  safe .PERIOD if  that  amusement  park  were  rusty  and  falling  apart ,COMMA you'd  never  go  on  the  ride .PERIOD so ,COMMA it  's  pitting  one  against  the  other .PERIOD the  other  neat  thing .PERIOD so  jake  cress  is  this  furniture  maker ,COMMA and  he  makes  this  unbelievable  set  of  furniture .PERIOD and  this  is  his  chair  with  claw ,COMMA and  the  poor  little  chair  has  lost  its  ball  and  it  's  trying  to  get  it  back  before  anybody  notices .PERIOD and  what  's  so  neat  about  it  is  how  you  accept  that  story .PERIOD and  that  's  what  's  nice  about  emotion .PERIOD so  that  's  the  new  me .PERIOD i  'm  only  saying  positive  things  from  now  on .PERIOD i  first  became  fascinated  with  octopus  at  an  early  age .PERIOD i  grew  up  in  mobile ,COMMA alabama  -- .PERIOD somebody  's  got  to  be  from  mobile ,COMMA right ?QUESTIONMARK -- .PERIOD and  mobile  sits  at  the  confluence  of  five  rivers ,COMMA forming  this  beautiful  delta .PERIOD and  the  delta  has  alligators  crawling  in  and  out  of  rivers  filled  with  fish  and  cypress  trees  dripping  with  snakes ,COMMA birds  of  every  flavor .PERIOD it  's  an  absolute  magical  wonderland  to  live  in ,COMMA if  you  're  a  kid  interested  in  animals ,COMMA to  grow  up  in .PERIOD and  this  delta  water  flows  to  mobile  bay ,COMMA and  finally  into  the  gulf  of  mexico .PERIOD and  i  remember  my  first  real  contact  with  octopus  was  probably  at  age  five  or  six .PERIOD i  was  in  the  gulf ,COMMA and  i  was  swimming  around  and  saw  a  little  octopus  on  the  bottom .PERIOD and  i  reached  down  and  picked  him  up ,COMMA and  immediately  became  fascinated  and  impressed  by  its  speed  and  its  strength  and  agility .PERIOD it  was  prying  my  fingers  apart  and  moving  to  the  back  of  my  hand .PERIOD it  was  all  i  could  do  to  hold  onto  this  amazing  creature .PERIOD then  it  sort  of  calmed  down  in  the  palms  of  my  hands  and  started  flashing  colors ,COMMA just  pulsing  all  of  these  colors .PERIOD and  as  i  looked  at  it ,COMMA it  kind  of  tucked  its  arms  under  it ,COMMA raised  into  a  spherical  shape  and  turned  chocolate  brown  with  two  white  stripes .PERIOD i  'm  going ,COMMA my  gosh  i  had  never  seen  anything  like  this  in  my  life .PERIOD so  i  marveled  for  a  moment ,COMMA and  then  decided  it  was  time  to  release  him ,COMMA so  i  put  him  down .PERIOD the  octopus  left  my  hands  and  then  did  the  damnedest  thing: .PERIOD it  landed  on  the  bottom  in  the  rubble  and ,COMMA fwoosh ,COMMA vanished  right  before  my  eyes .PERIOD and  i  knew ,COMMA right  then ,COMMA at  age  six ,COMMA that  is  an  animal  that  i  want  to  learn  more  about .PERIOD so  i  did .PERIOD and  i  went  off  to  college  and  got  a  degree  in  marine  zoology ,COMMA and  then  moved  to  hawaii  and  entered  graduate  school  at  the  university  of  hawaii .PERIOD and  while  a  student  at  hawaii ,COMMA i  worked  at  the  waikiki  aquarium .PERIOD and  the  aquarium  had  a  lot  of  big  fish  tanks  but  not  a  lot  of  invertebrate  displays ,COMMA and  being  the  spineless  guy ,COMMA i  thought ,COMMA well  i  'll  just  go  out  in  the  field  and  collect  these  wonderful  animals  i  had  been  learning  about  as  a  student  and  bring  them  in ,COMMA and  i  built  these  elaborate  sets  and  put  them  on  display .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  fish  in  the  tanks  were  gorgeous  to  look  at ,COMMA but  they  did  n't  really  interact  with  people .PERIOD but  the  octopus  did .PERIOD if  you  walked  up  to  an  octopus  tank ,COMMA especially  early  in  the  morning  before  anyone  arrived ,COMMA the  octopus  would  rise  up  and  look  at  you  and  you  're  thinking ,COMMA is  that  guy  really  looking  at  me ?QUESTIONMARK he  is  looking  at  me  and  you  walk  up  to  the  front  of  the  tank .PERIOD then  you  realize  that  these  animals  all  have  different  personalities: .PERIOD some  of  them  would  hold  their  ground .PERIOD others  would  slink  into  the  back  of  the  tank  and  disappear  in  the  rocks .PERIOD and  one  in  particular ,COMMA this  amazing  animal .PERIOD i  went  up  to  the  front  of  the  tank ,COMMA and  he  's  just  staring  at  me .PERIOD and  he  had  little  horns  come  up  above  his  eyes .PERIOD so  i  went  right  up  to  the  front  of  the  tank  -- .PERIOD i  was  three  or  four  inches  from  the  front  glass  -- .PERIOD and  the  octopus  was  sitting  on  a  perch ,COMMA a  little  rock ,COMMA and  he  came  off  the  rock  and  he  also  came  down  right  to  the  front  of  the  glass .PERIOD so  i  was  staring  at  this  animal  about  six  or  seven  inches  away ,COMMA and  at  that  time  i  could  actually  focus  that  close .PERIOD now  as  i  look  at  my  fuzzy  fingers  i  realize  those  days  are  long  gone .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA there  we  were ,COMMA staring  at  each  other ,COMMA and  he  reaches  down  and  grabs  an  armful  of  gravel  and  releases  it  in  the  jet  of  water  entering  the  tank  from  the  filtration  system ,COMMA and ,COMMA chk  chk  chk  chk  chk ,COMMA this  gravel  hits  the  front  of  the  glass  and  falls  down .PERIOD he  reaches  up ,COMMA takes  another  armful  of  gravel ,COMMA releases  it ,COMMA chk  chk  chk  chk  chk ,COMMA same  thing .PERIOD then  he  lifts  another  arm  and  i  lift  an  arm .PERIOD then  he  lifts  another  arm  and  i  lift  another  arm .PERIOD and  then  i  realize  the  octopus  won  the  arms  race ,COMMA because  i  was  out  and  he  had  six  left .PERIOD but  the  only  way  i  can  describe  what  i  was  seeing  that  day  was  that  this  octopus  was  playing ,COMMA which  is  a  pretty  sophisticated  behavior  for  a  mere  invertebrate .PERIOD so ,COMMA about  three  years  into  my  degree ,COMMA a  funny  thing  happened  on  the  way  to  the  office ,COMMA which  actually  changed  the  course  of  my  life .PERIOD a  man  came  into  the  aquarium .PERIOD it  's  a  long  story ,COMMA but  essentially  he  sent  me  and  a  couple  of  friends  of  mine  to  the  south  pacific  to  collect  animals  for  him ,COMMA and  as  we  left ,COMMA he  gave  us  two  16-millimeter  movie  cameras .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA make  a  movie  about  this  expedition  ok ,COMMA a  couple  of  biologists  making  a  movie ,COMMA this  'll  be  interesting .PERIOD and  off  we  went .PERIOD and  we  did ,COMMA we  made  a  movie ,COMMA which  had  to  be  the  worst  movie  ever  made  in  the  history  of  movie  making .PERIOD but  it  was  a  blast .PERIOD i  had  so  much  fun .PERIOD and  i  remember  that  proverbial  light  going  off  in  my  head ,COMMA thinking ,COMMA wait  a  minute .PERIOD maybe  i  can  do  this  all  the  time .PERIOD yeah ,COMMA i  'll  be  a  filmmaker  so  i  literally  came  back  from  that  job ,COMMA quit  school ,COMMA hung  my  filmmaking  shingle  and  just  never  told  anyone  that  i  did  n't  know  what  i  was  doing .PERIOD it  's  been  a  good  ride .PERIOD and  what  i  learned  in  school  though  was  really  beneficial .PERIOD if  you  're  a  wildlife  filmmaker  and  you  're  going  out  into  the  field  to  film  animals ,COMMA especially  behavior ,COMMA it  helps  to  have  a  fundamental  background  on  who  these  animals  are ,COMMA how  they  work  and ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA a  bit  about  their  behaviors .PERIOD but  where  i  really  learned  about  octopus  was  in  the  field ,COMMA as  a  filmmaker  making  films  with  them ,COMMA where  you  're  allowed  to  spend  large  periods  of  time  with  the  animals ,COMMA seeing  octopus  being  octopus  in  their  ocean  homes .PERIOD i  remember  i  took  a  trip  to  australia ,COMMA went  to  an  island  called  one  tree  island .PERIOD and  apparently ,COMMA evolution  had  occurred  at  a  pretty  rapid  rate  on  one  tree .PERIOD between  the  time  they  named  it  and  the  time  i  arrived ,COMMA because  i  'm  sure  there  were  at  least  three  trees  on  that  island  when  we  were  there .PERIOD anyway ,COMMA one  tree  is  situated  right  next  to  a  beautiful  coral  reef .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA there  's  a  surge  channel  where  the  tide  is  moving  back  and  forth ,COMMA twice  a  day ,COMMA pretty  rapidly .PERIOD and  there  's  a  beautiful  reef ,COMMA very  complex  reef ,COMMA with  lots  of  animals ,COMMA including  a  lot  of  octopus .PERIOD and  not  uniquely  but  certainly ,COMMA the  octopus  in  australia  are  masters  at  camouflage .PERIOD as  a  matter  of  fact ,COMMA there  's  one  right  there .PERIOD so  our  first  challenge  was  to  find  these  things ,COMMA and  that  was  a  challenge ,COMMA indeed .PERIOD but  the  idea  is ,COMMA we  were  there  for  a  month  and  i  wanted  to  acclimate  the  animals  to  us .PERIOD so  that  we  could  see  behaviors  without  disturbing  them .PERIOD so  the  first  week  was  pretty  much  spent  just  getting  as  close  as  we  could ,COMMA every  day  a  little  closer ,COMMA a  little  closer ,COMMA a  little  closer .PERIOD and  you  knew  what  the  limit  was ,COMMA they  would  start  getting  twitchy  and  you'd  back  up ,COMMA come  back  in  a  few  hours .PERIOD and  after  the  first  week ,COMMA they  ignored  us .PERIOD it  was  like ,COMMA i  do  n't  know  what  that  thing  is ,COMMA but  he  's  no  threat  to  me  so  they  went  on  about  their  business .PERIOD and  from  a  foot  away ,COMMA we  're  watching  mating  and  courting  and  fighting  and  it  is  just  an  unbelievable  experience .PERIOD and  one  of  the  most  fantastic  displays  that  i  remember ,COMMA or  at  least  visually ,COMMA was  a  foraging  behavior .PERIOD and  they  had  a  lot  of  different  techniques  that  they  would  use  for  foraging .PERIOD but  this  particular  one  used  vision .PERIOD and  they  would  see  a  coral  head ,COMMA maybe  10  feet  away ,COMMA and  start  moving  over  toward  that  coral  head .PERIOD and  i  do  n't  know  whether  they  actually  saw  crab  in  it ,COMMA or  imagined  that  one  might  be ,COMMA but  whatever  the  case ,COMMA they  would  leap  off  the  bottom  and  go  through  the  water  and  land  right  on  top  of  this  coral  head ,COMMA and  then  the  web  between  the  arms  would  completely  engulf  the  coral  head ,COMMA and  they  would  fish  out ,COMMA swim  for  crabs .PERIOD and  as  soon  as  the  crabs  touched  the  arm ,COMMA it  was  lights  out .PERIOD and  i  always  wondered  what  happened  under  that  web .PERIOD so  we  created  a  way  to  find  out .PERIOD and  i  got  my  first  look  at  that  famous  beak  in  action .PERIOD it  was  fantastic .PERIOD if  you  're  going  to  make  a  lot  of  films  about  a  particular  group  of  animals ,COMMA you  might  as  well  pick  one  that  's  fairly  common .PERIOD and  octopus  are ,COMMA they  live  in  all  the  oceans .PERIOD they  also  live  deep .PERIOD and  i  cannot  say  octopus  are  responsible  for  my  really  strong  interest  in  getting  in  subs  and  going  deep ,COMMA but  whatever  the  case ,COMMA i  like  that .PERIOD it  's  like  nothing  you've  ever  done .PERIOD if  you  ever  really  want  to  get  away  from  it  all  and  see  something  that  you  have  never  seen ,COMMA and  have  an  excellent  chance  of  seeing  something  no  one  has  ever  seen ,COMMA get  in  a  sub .PERIOD you  climb  in ,COMMA seal  the  hatch ,COMMA turn  on  a  little  oxygen ,COMMA turn  on  the  scrubber ,COMMA which  removes  the  co2  in  the  air  you  breathe ,COMMA and  they  chuck  you  overboard .PERIOD down  you  go .PERIOD there  's  no  connection  to  the  surface  apart  from  a  pretty  funky  radio .PERIOD and  as  you  go  down ,COMMA the  washing  machine  at  the  surface  calms  down .PERIOD and  it  gets  quiet .PERIOD and  it  starts  getting  really  nice .PERIOD and  as  you  go  deeper ,COMMA that  lovely ,COMMA blue  water  you  were  launched  in  gives  way  to  darker  and  darker  blue .PERIOD and  finally ,COMMA it  's  a  rich  lavender ,COMMA and  after  a  couple  of  thousand  feet ,COMMA it  's  ink  black .PERIOD

,COMMA as  far  as  i  'm  concerned ,COMMA without  question ,COMMA the  most  bizarre  designs  and  outrageous  behaviors  are  in  the  animals  that  live  in  the  mid-water  community .PERIOD but  we  're  just  going  to  zip  right  past  this  area ,COMMA this  area  that  includes  about  95  percent  of  the  living  space  on  our  planet  and  go  to  the  mid-ocean  ridge ,COMMA which  i  think  is  even  more  extraordinary .PERIOD the  mid-ocean  ridge  is  a  huge  mountain  range ,COMMA 40,000  miles  long ,COMMA snaking  around  the  entire  globe .PERIOD and  they  're  big  mountains ,COMMA thousands  of  feet  tall ,COMMA some  of  which  are  tens  of  thousands  of  feet  and  bust  through  the  surface ,COMMA creating  islands  like  hawaii .PERIOD and  the  top  of  this  mountain  range  is  splitting  apart ,COMMA creating  a  rift  valley .PERIOD and  when  you  dive  into  that  rift  valley ,COMMA that  's  where  the  action  is  because  literally  thousands  of  active  volcanoes  are  going  off  at  any  point  in  time  all  along  this  40,000  mile  range .PERIOD and  as  these  tectonic  plates  are  spreading  apart ,COMMA magma ,COMMA lava  is  coming  up  and  filling  those  gaps .PERIOD and  you  're  looking  land ,COMMA new  land ,COMMA being  created  right  before  your  eyes .PERIOD and  over  the  tops  of  them  is  3,000

yellowstone .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA this  whole  area  is  like  a  yellowstone  national  park  with  all  of  the  trimmings .PERIOD and  this  vent  fluid  is  about  600  or  700  degrees  f .PERIOD the  surrounding  water  is  just  a  couple  of  degrees  above  freezing .PERIOD so  it  immediately  cools ,COMMA and  it  can  no  longer  hold  in  suspension  all  of  the  material

.PERIOD and  all  along  the  sides  of  these  chimneys  is  shimmering  with  heat  and  loaded  with  life .PERIOD you've  got  black  smokers  going  all  over  the  place  and  chimneys  that  have  tube  worms  that  might  be  eight  to  10  feet  long .PERIOD and  out  of  the  tops  of  these  tube  worms  are  these  beautiful  red  plumes .PERIOD and  living  amongst  the  tangle  of  tube  worms  is  an  entire  community  of  animals ,COMMA shrimp ,COMMA fish ,COMMA lobsters ,COMMA crab ,COMMA clams  and  swarms  of  arthropods  that  are  playing  that  dangerous  game  between

.PERIOD it  made  scientists  rethink  where  life  on  earth  might  have  actually  begun .PERIOD and  before  the  discovery  of  these  vents ,COMMA all  life  on  earth ,COMMA the  key  to  life  on  earth ,COMMA was  believed  to  be  the  sun  and  photosynthesis .PERIOD but  down  there ,COMMA there  is  no  sun ,COMMA there  is  no  photosynthesis .PERIOD it  's  chemosynthetic

another  planet .PERIOD it  's  amazing  to  think  that  this  is  actually  on  earth .PERIOD it  looks  like  aliens  in  an  alien  environment .PERIOD but  you  go  back  to  the  same  vent

creating  a  really  nice  ghost  town ,COMMA an  eerie ,COMMA spooky  ghost  town ,COMMA but  essentially  devoid  of  animals ,COMMA of  course .PERIOD but  10  miles  down  the  ridge .PERIOD pshhh .PERIOD there  's  another  volcano  going .PERIOD and  there  's  a  whole  new  hydrothermal  vent  community  that  has  been  formed .PERIOD and  this  kind  of  life  and  death  of  hydrothermal  vent  communities  is  going  on  every  30  or  40  years  all  along  the  ridge .PERIOD and  that  ephemeral  nature  of  the  hydrothermal  vent  community  is  n't  really  different  from  some  of  the  areas  that  i've  seen  in  35  years  of  traveling  around ,COMMA making  films .PERIOD where  you  go  and  film  a  really  nice  sequence  at  a  bay .PERIOD and  you  go  back ,COMMA and  i  'm  at  home ,COMMA and  i  'm  thinking ,COMMA okay ,COMMA what  can  i  shoot .PERIOD ah .PERIOD i  know  where  i  can  shoot  that .PERIOD there  's  this  beautiful  bay ,COMMA lots  of  soft  corals  and  stomatopods  and  you  show  up ,COMMA and  it  's  dead .PERIOD there  's  no  coral ,COMMA algae  growing  on  it ,COMMA and  the  water  's  pea  soup .PERIOD you  think ,COMMA well ,COMMA what  happened  and  you  turn  around ,COMMA and  there  's  a  hillside  behind  you  with  a  neighborhood  going  in ,COMMA and  bulldozers  are  pushing  piles  of  soil  back  and  forth .PERIOD and  over  here  there  's  a  golf  course  going  in .PERIOD and  this  is  the  tropics .PERIOD it  's  raining  like  crazy  here .PERIOD so  this  rainwater  is  flooding  down  the

 soup .PERIOD but ,COMMA encouragingly ,COMMA i've  seen  just  the  opposite .PERIOD i've  been  to  a  place  that  was  a  pretty  trashed  bay .PERIOD and  i  looked  at  it ,COMMA just  said ,COMMA yuck ,COMMA and  go  and  work  on  the  other  side  of  the  island .PERIOD five  years  later ,COMMA come  back ,COMMA and  that  same  bay  is  now  gorgeous .PERIOD it  's  beautiful .PERIOD it  's  got  living  coral ,COMMA fish  all  over  the  place ,COMMA crystal  clear  water ,COMMA and  you  go ,COMMA how  did  that  happen  well ,COMMA how  it  happened  is  the  local  community  galvanized .PERIOD they  recognized  what  was  happening  on  the  hillside  and  put  a  stop  to  it .PERIOD enacted  laws  and  made  permits  required  to  do  responsible  construction  and  golf  course  maintenance  and  stopped  the  sediments  flowing  into  the  bay ,COMMA and  stopped  the  chemicals  flowing  into  the  bay ,COMMA and  the  bay  recovered .PERIOD the  ocean  has  an  amazing  ability  to  recover ,COMMA if  we  'll  just  leave  it  alone .PERIOD i  think  margaret  mead  said  it  best .PERIOD she  said  that  a  small  group  of  thoughtful

of  grassroots  organizations .PERIOD i've  been  to  a  lot  of  lectures  where ,COMMA at  the  end  of  it ,COMMA inevitably ,COMMA one  of  the  first  questions  that  comes  up  is ,COMMA but ,COMMA but  what  can  i  do ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  an  individual .PERIOD i  'm  one  person .PERIOD and  these  problems  are  so  large  and  global ,COMMA and  it  's  just  overwhelming  fair

actually .PERIOD what  do  you  really  care  about  that  is  n't  right  where  you  live ?QUESTIONMARK and  fix  it .PERIOD create  a  healing  zone  in  your  neighborhood  and  encourage  others  to  do  the  same .PERIOD and  maybe  these  healing  zones  can  sprinkle  a  map ,COMMA little  dots  on  a  map .PERIOD and  in  fact ,COMMA the  way  that  we  can  communicate  today ,COMMA where  alaska  is  instantly  knowing  what  's  going  on  in  china ,COMMA and  the  kiwis  did  this ,COMMA and  then  over  in  england  they  tried  to .PERIOD and  everybody  is  talking  to  everyone  else  -- .PERIOD it  's  not  isolated  points  on  a  map  anymore ,COMMA it  's  a  network  we've  created .PERIOD and  maybe  these  healing  zones  can  start  growing ,COMMA and  possibly  even  overlap ,COMMA and  good  things  can  happen .PERIOD so  that  's  how  i  answer  that  question .PERIOD look  in  your  own  backyard ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA look  in  the  mirror .PERIOD what  can  you  do  that  is  more  responsible  than  what  you  're  doing  now ?QUESTIONMARK and  do  that ,COMMA and  spread  the  word .PERIOD the  vent  community  animals  cannot  really  do  much  about  the  life  and  death  that  's  going  on  where  they  live ,COMMA but  up  here  we  can .PERIOD in  theory ,COMMA we  're  thinking ,COMMA rational  human  beings .PERIOD and  we  can  make  changes  to  our  behavior  that  will  influence  and  affect  the  environment ,COMMA like  those  people  changed  the  health  of  that  bay .PERIOD now ,COMMA sylvia  's  ted  prize  wish  was

spots ,COMMA she  calls  them .PERIOD and  i  applaud  that .PERIOD i  loudly  applaud  that .PERIOD and  it  's  my  hope  that  some  of  these  hope  spots  can  be  in  the  deep  ocean ,COMMA an

place  in  his  country .PERIOD that  post-apartheid  rainbow  nation ,COMMA a  thousand  people  were  dying  on  a  daily  basis  and  that  the  front  line  victims ,COMMA the  most  vulnerable  of  all ,COMMA were  women  and  children .PERIOD this  was  a  huge  impact  on  my  mind .PERIOD because  i  am  a  woman  and  i  am  a  mother ,COMMA and  i  had  n't  realized  that  the  hiv/aids  pandemic  was  directly  affecting  women  in  such  a  way .PERIOD and  so  i  committed ,COMMA when  i  left  south  africa ,COMMA when  i  left  capetown ,COMMA i  told  myself ,COMMA this  is  going  to  be  something  that  i  have  to  talk  about .PERIOD i  have  to  serve  and  so ,COMMA subsequently  i  participated  in  every  single  46664  event  that  i  could  take  part

because  of  the  stigma ,COMMA by  wearing  this  t-shirt  i  say ,COMMA yes ,COMMA we  can  talk  about  this  issue .PERIOD it  does  n't  have  to  be  in  the  closet  i  became  a  member  of

.PERIOD and  here  i  am  with  a  pregnant  woman ,COMMA who  is  hiv  positive  and  we  're  smiling ,COMMA both  of  us  are  smiling ,COMMA because  we  're  very  confident ,COMMA because  we

mankind  to  fly  like  a  bird .PERIOD birds  are  very  agile .PERIOD they  fly ,COMMA not  with  rotating  components ,COMMA so  they  fly  only  by  flapping  their  wings .PERIOD so  we  looked  at  the  birds ,COMMA and  we  tried  to  make  a  model  that  is  powerful ,COMMA ultralight ,COMMA and  it  must  have  excellent  aerodynamic  qualities  that  would  fly  by  its  own  and  only  by  flapping  its  wings .PERIOD so  what  would  be  better  than  to  use  the  herring  gull ,COMMA in  its  freedom ,COMMA circling  and  swooping  over  the  sea ,COMMA and  to  use  this  as  a  role  model ?QUESTIONMARK so  we  bring  a  team  together .PERIOD there  are  generalists  and  also  specialists  in  the  field  of  aerodynamics  in  the  field  of  building  gliders .PERIOD and  the  task  was  to  build  an  ultralight  indoor-flying  model  that  is  able  to  fly  over  your  heads .PERIOD so  be  careful  later  on .PERIOD and  this  was  one  issue ,COMMA to  build  it  that  lightweight  that  no  one  would  be  hurt  if  it  fell  down .PERIOD so  why  do  we  do  all  this ?QUESTIONMARK we  are  a  company  in  the  field  of  automation ,COMMA and  we'd  like  to  do  very  lightweight  structures  because  that  's  energy  efficient .PERIOD and  we'd  like  to  learn  more  about  pneumatics  and  air  flow  phenomena .PERIOD so  i  now  would  like  you  to  put  your  seat  belts  on  and  put  your  hats  on .PERIOD so  maybe  we  'll  try  it  once ,COMMA to  fly  a  smartbird .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD so  we  can  now  look  at  the  smartbird .PERIOD so  here  is  one  without  a  skin .PERIOD we  have  a  wingspan  of  about  two  meters .PERIOD the  length  is  one  meter  and  six ,COMMA and  the  weight ,COMMA it  is  only  450  grams .PERIOD and  it  is  all  out  of  carbon  fiber .PERIOD in  the  middle  we  have  a  motor ,COMMA and  we  also  have  a  gear  in  it .PERIOD and  we  use  the  gear  to  transfer  the  circulation  of  the  motor .PERIOD so  within  the  motor ,COMMA we  have  three  hall  sensors ,COMMA so  we  know  exactly  where  the  wing  is .PERIOD and  if  we  now  beat  up  and  down .PERIOD we  have  the  possibility  to  fly  like  a  bird .PERIOD so  if  you  go  down ,COMMA you  have  the  large  area  of  propulsion .PERIOD and  if  you  go  up ,COMMA the  wings  are  not  that  large ,COMMA and  it  is  easier  to  get  up .PERIOD so ,COMMA the  next  thing  we  did ,COMMA or  the  challenges  we  did ,COMMA was  to  coordinate  this  movement .PERIOD we  have  to  turn  it ,COMMA go  up  and  go  down .PERIOD we  have  a  split  wing .PERIOD with  a  split  wing  we  get  the  lift  at  the  upper  wing ,COMMA and  we  get  the  propulsion  at  the  lower  wing .PERIOD also ,COMMA we  see  how  we  measure  the  aerodynamic  efficiency .PERIOD we  had  knowledge  about  the  electromechanical  efficiency  and  then  we  can  calculate  the  aerodynamic  efficiency .PERIOD so  therefore ,COMMA it  rises  up  from  passive  torsion  to  active  torsion ,COMMA from  30  percent  up  to  80  percent .PERIOD next  thing  we  have  to  do ,COMMA we  have  to  control  and  regulate  the  whole  structure .PERIOD only  if  you  control  and  regulate  it ,COMMA you  will  get  that  aerodynamic  efficiency .PERIOD so  the  overall  consumption  of  energy  is  about  25  watts  at  takeoff  and  16  to  18  watts  in  flight .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD bruno  giussani ,COMMA markus ,COMMA i  think  that  we  should  fly  it  once  more .PERIOD markus  fischer ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA sure .PERIOD whoa ,COMMA dude .PERIOD check  out  those  killer  equations .PERIOD sweet .PERIOD actually ,COMMA for  the  next  18  minutes  i  'm  going  to  do  the  best  i  can  to  describe  the  beauty  of  particle  physics  without  equations .PERIOD it  turns  out  there  's  a  lot  we  can  learn  from  coral .PERIOD coral  is  a  very  beautiful  and  unusual  animal .PERIOD each  coral  head  consists  of  thousand  of  individual  polyps .PERIOD these  polyps  are  continually  budding  and  branching  into  genetically  identical  neighbors .PERIOD if  we  imagine  this  to  be  a  hyper-intelligent  coral ,COMMA we  can  single  out  an  individual  and  ask  him  a  reasonable  question .PERIOD we  can  ask  how  exactly  he  got  to  be  in  this  particular  location  compared  to  his  neighbors  -- .PERIOD if  it  was  just  chance ,COMMA or  destiny ,COMMA or  what ?QUESTIONMARK now ,COMMA after  admonishing  us  for  turning  the  temperature  up  too  high ,COMMA he  would  tell  us  that  our  question  was  completely  stupid .PERIOD these  corals  can  be  quite  kind  of  mean ,COMMA you  see ,COMMA and  i  have  surfing  scars  to  prove  that .PERIOD but  this  polyp  would  continue  and  tell  us  that  his  neighbors  were  quite  clearly  identical  copies  of  him .PERIOD that  he  was  in  all  these  other  locations  as  well ,COMMA but  experiencing  them  as  separate  individuals .PERIOD for  a  coral ,COMMA branching  into  different  copies  is  the  most  natural  thing  in  the  world .PERIOD unlike  us ,COMMA a  hyper-intelligent  coral  would  be  uniquely  prepared  to  understand  quantum  mechanics .PERIOD the  mathematics  of  quantum  mechanics  very  accurately  describes  how  our  universe  works .PERIOD and  it  tells  us  our  reality  is  continually  branching  into  different  possibilities ,COMMA just  like  a  coral .PERIOD it  's  a  weird  thing  for  us  humans  to  wrap  our  minds  around ,COMMA since  we  only  ever  get  to  experience  one  possibility .PERIOD this  quantum  weirdness  was  first  described  by  erwin  schrödinger  and  his  cat .PERIOD the  cat  likes  this  version  better .PERIOD in  this  setup ,COMMA schrödinger  is  in  a  box  with  a  radioactive  sample .PERIOD that ,COMMA by  the  laws  of  quantum  mechanics ,COMMA branches  into  a  state  in  which  it  is  radiated  and  a  state  in  which  it  is  not .PERIOD in  the  branch  in  which  the  sample  radiates ,COMMA it  sets  off  a  trigger  that  releases  poison  and  schrödinger  is  dead .PERIOD but  in  the  other  branch  of  reality ,COMMA he  remains  alive .PERIOD these  realities  are  experienced  separately  by  each  individual .PERIOD as  far  as  either  can  tell ,COMMA the  other  one  does  n't  exist .PERIOD this  seems  weird  to  us ,COMMA because  each  of  us  only  experiences  an  individual  existence ,COMMA and  we  do  n't  get  to  see  other  branches .PERIOD it  's  as  if  each  of  us ,COMMA like  schrödinger  here ,COMMA are  a  kind  of  coral  branching  into  different  possibilities .PERIOD the  mathematics  of  quantum  mechanics  tells  us  this  is  how  the  world  works  at  tiny  scales .PERIOD it  can  be  summed  up  in  a  single  sentence ,COMMA everything  that  can  happen ,COMMA does .PERIOD that  's  quantum  mechanics .PERIOD but  this  does  not  mean  everything  happens .PERIOD the  rest  of  physics  is  about  describing  what  can  happen  and  what  cannot .PERIOD what  physics  tells  us  is  that  everything  comes  down  to  geometry  and  the  interactions  of  elementary  particles .PERIOD and  things  can  happen  only  if  these  interactions  are  perfectly  balanced .PERIOD now  i  'll  go  ahead  and  describe  how  we  know  about  these  particles ,COMMA what  they  are  and  how  this  balance  works .PERIOD in  this  machine ,COMMA a  beam  of  protons  and  anti-protons  are  accelerated  to  near  the  speed  of  light  and  brought  together  in  a  collision ,COMMA producing  a  burst  of  pure  energy .PERIOD this  energy  is  immediately  converted  into  a  spray  of  subatomic  particles ,COMMA with  detectors  and  computers  used  to  figure  out  their  properties .PERIOD this  enormous  machine ,COMMA the  large  hadron  collider  at  cern  in  geneva  -- .PERIOD has  a  circumference  of  17  miles  and ,COMMA when  it  's  operating ,COMMA draws  five  times  as  much  power  as  the  city  of  monterey .PERIOD we  cannot  predict  specifically  what  particles  will  be  produced .PERIOD in  any  individual  collision .PERIOD quantum  mechanics  tells  us  all  possibilities  are  realized .PERIOD but  physics  does  tell  us  what  particles  can  be  produced .PERIOD these  particles  must  have  just  as  much  mass  and  energy  as  is  carried  in  by  the  proton  and  anti-proton .PERIOD any  particles  more  massive  than  this  energy  limit  are  n't  produced ,COMMA and  remain  invisible  to  us .PERIOD this  is  why  this  new  particle  accelerator  is  so  exciting .PERIOD it  's  going  to  push  this  energy  limit  seven  times  beyond  what  's  ever  been  done  before ,COMMA so  we  're  going  to  get  to  see  some  new  particles  very  soon .PERIOD but  before  talking  about  what  we  might  see ,COMMA let  me  describe  the  particles  we  already  know  of .PERIOD there  's  a  whole  zoo  of  subatomic  particles .PERIOD most  of  us  are  familiar  with  electrons .PERIOD a  lot  of  people  in  this  room  make  a  good  living .PERIOD pushing  them  around .PERIOD but  the  electron  also  has  a  neutral  partner  called  the  neutrino ,COMMA with  no  electric  charge  and  a  very  tiny  mass .PERIOD in  contrast ,COMMA the  up-and-down  quarks  have  very  large  masses ,COMMA and  combine  in  threes  to  make  the  protons  and  neutrons .PERIOD inside  atoms .PERIOD all  of  these  matter  particles  come  in  left-  and  right-handed  varieties ,COMMA and  have  anti-particle  partners  that  carry  opposite  charges .PERIOD these  familiar  particles  also  have  less  familiar  second  and  third  generations ,COMMA which  have  the  same  charges  as  the  first  but  have  much  higher  masses .PERIOD these  matter  particles  all  interact  with  the  various  force  particles .PERIOD the  electromagnetic  force  interacts  with  electrically  charged  matter .PERIOD via  particles  called  photons .PERIOD there  is  also  a  very  weak  force  called ,COMMA rather  unimaginatively ,COMMA the  weak  force ,COMMA that  interacts  only  with  left-handed  matter .PERIOD the  strong  force  acts  between  quarks  which  carry  a  different  kind  of  charge ,COMMA called  color  charge ,COMMA and  come  in  three  different  varieties ,COMMA red ,COMMA green  and  blue .PERIOD you  can  blame  murray  gell-mann  for  these  names  -- .PERIOD they  're  his  fault .PERIOD finally ,COMMA there  's  the  force  of  gravity ,COMMA which  interacts  with  matter  via  its  mass  and  spin .PERIOD the  most  important  thing  to  understand  here  is  that  there  's  a  different  kind  of  charge  associated  with  each  of  these  forces .PERIOD these  four  different  forces  interact  with  matter  according  to  the  corresponding  charges  that  each  particle  has .PERIOD a  particle  that  has  n't  been  seen  yet ,COMMA but  we  're  pretty  sure  exists ,COMMA is  the  higgs  particle ,COMMA which  gives  masses  to  all  these  other  particles .PERIOD the  main  purpose  of  the  large  hadron  collider  is  to  see  this  higgs  particle ,COMMA and  we  're  almost  certain  it  will .PERIOD but  the  greatest  mystery  is  what  else  we  might  see .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  show  you  one  beautiful  possibility  towards  the  end  of  this  talk .PERIOD now ,COMMA if  we  count  up  all  these  different  particles  using  their  various  spins  and  charges ,COMMA there  are  226 .PERIOD that  's  a  lot  of  particles  to  keep  track  of .PERIOD and  it  seems  strange  that  nature  would  have  so  many  elementary  particles .PERIOD but  if  we  plot  them  out  according  to  their  charges ,COMMA some  beautiful  patterns  emerge .PERIOD the  most  familiar  charge  is  electric  charge .PERIOD electrons  have  an  electric  charge ,COMMA a  negative  one .PERIOD and  quarks  have  electric  charges  in  thirds .PERIOD so  when  two  up  quarks  and  a  down  quark  are  combined  to  make  a  proton ,COMMA it  has  a  total  electric  charge  of  plus  one .PERIOD these  particles  also  have  anti-particles ,COMMA which  have  opposite  charges .PERIOD now ,COMMA it  turns  out  the  electric  charge  is  actually  a  combination  of  two  other  charges ,COMMA hypercharge  and  weak  charge .PERIOD if  we  spread  out  the  hypercharge  and  weak  charge  and  plot  the  charges  of  particles  in  this  two-dimensional  charge  space ,COMMA the  electric  charge  is  where  these  particles  sit  along  the  vertical  direction .PERIOD the  electromagnetic  and  weak  forces  interact  with  matter  according  to  their  hypercharge  and  weak  charge .PERIOD which  make  this  pattern .PERIOD this  is  called  the  unified  electroweak  model ,COMMA and  it  was  put  together  back  in  1967 .PERIOD the  reason  most  of  us  are  only  familiar  with  electric  charge  and  not  both  of  these  is  because  of  the  higgs  particle .PERIOD the  higgs ,COMMA over  here  on  the  left ,COMMA has  a  large  mass  and  breaks  the  symmetry  of  this  electroweak  pattern .PERIOD it  makes  the  weak  force  very  weak  by  giving  the  weak  particles  a  large  mass .PERIOD since  this  massive  higgs  sits  along  the  horizontal  direction  in  this  diagram ,COMMA the  photons  of  electromagnetism  remain  massless  and  interact  with  electric  charge  along  the  vertical  direction  in  this  charge  space .PERIOD so  the  electromagnetic  and  weak  forces  are  described  by  this  pattern  of  particle  charges  in  two-dimensional  space .PERIOD we  can  include  the  strong  force  by  spreading  out  its  two  charge  directions  and  plotting  the  charges  of  the  force  particles  in  quarks  along  these  directions .PERIOD the  charges  of  all  known  particles  can  be  plotted  in  a  four-dimensional  charge  space ,COMMA and  projected  down  to  two  dimensions  like  this  so  we  can  see  them .PERIOD whenever  particles  interact ,COMMA nature  keeps  things  in  a  perfect  balance  along  all  four  of  these  charge  directions .PERIOD if  a  particle  and  an  anti-particle  collide ,COMMA it  creates  a  burst  of  energy  and  a  total  charge  of  zero  in  all  four  charge  directions .PERIOD at  this  point ,COMMA anything  can  be  created  as  long  as  it  has  the  same  energy  and  maintains  a  total  charge  of  zero .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA this  weak  force  particle  and  its  anti-particle  can  be  created  in  a  collision .PERIOD in  further  interactions ,COMMA the  charges  must  always  balance .PERIOD one  of  the  weak  particles  could  decay  into  an  electron  and  an  anti-neutrino ,COMMA and  these  three  still  add  to  zero  total  charge .PERIOD nature  always  keeps  a  perfect  balance .PERIOD so  these  patterns  of  charges  are  not  just  pretty .PERIOD they  tell  us  what  interactions  are  allowed  to  happen .PERIOD and  we  can  rotate  this  charge  space  in  four  dimensions  to  get  a  better  look  at  the  strong  interaction .PERIOD which  has  this  nice  hexagonal  symmetry .PERIOD in  a  strong  interaction ,COMMA a  strong  force  particle ,COMMA such  as  this  one ,COMMA interacts  with  a  colored  quark ,COMMA such  as  this  green  one ,COMMA to  give  a  quark  with  a  different  color  charge ,COMMA this  red  one .PERIOD and  strong  interactions  are  happening  millions  of  times  each  second  in  every  atom  of  our  bodies ,COMMA holding  the  atomic  nuclei  together .PERIOD but  these  four  charges  corresponding  to  three  forces .PERIOD are  not  the  end  of  the  story .PERIOD we  can  also  include  two  more  charges .PERIOD corresponding  to  the  gravitational  force .PERIOD when  we  include  these ,COMMA each  matter  particle  has  two  different  spin  charges ,COMMA spin-up  and  spin-down .PERIOD so  they  all  split ,COMMA and  give  a  nice  pattern  in  six-dimensional  charge  space .PERIOD we  can  rotate  this  pattern  in  six  dimensions ,COMMA and  see  that  it  's  quite  pretty .PERIOD right  now ,COMMA this  pattern  matches  our  best  current  knowledge  of  how  nature  is  built  at  the  tiny  scales  of  these  elementary  particles .PERIOD this  is  what  we  know  for  certain .PERIOD some  of  these  particles  are  at  the  very  limit  of  what  we've  been  able  to  reach  with  experiments .PERIOD from  this  pattern ,COMMA we  already  know  the  particle  physics  of  these  tiny  scales .PERIOD the  way  the  universe  works  with  these  tiny  scales  is  very  beautiful .PERIOD but  now  i  'm  going  to  discuss  some  new  and  old  ideas  about  things  we  do  n't  know  yet .PERIOD we  want  to  expand  this  pattern  using  mathematics  alone ,COMMA and  see  if  we  can  get  our  hands  on  the  whole  enchilada .PERIOD we  want  to  find  all  the  particles  and  forces  that  make  a  complete  picture  of  our  universe .PERIOD and  we  want  to  use  this  picture  to  predict  new  particles  that  we  'll  see  when  experiments  reach  higher  energies .PERIOD so  there  's  an  old  idea  in  particle  physics  that  this  known  pattern  of  charges ,COMMA which  is  not  very  symmetric ,COMMA could  emerge  from  a  more  perfect  pattern  that  gets  broken ,COMMA similar  to  how  the  higgs  particle  breaks  the  electroweak  pattern .PERIOD to  give  electromagnetism .PERIOD in  order  to  do  this ,COMMA we  need  to  introduce  new  forces  with  new  charge  directions .PERIOD when  we  introduce  a  new  direction ,COMMA we  get  to  guess  what  charges  the  particles  have  along  this  direction ,COMMA and  then  we  can  rotate  it  in  with  the  others .PERIOD if  we  guess  wisely ,COMMA we  can  construct  the  standard  charges  in  six  charge  dimensions  as  a  broken  symmetry  of  this  more  perfect  pattern  in  seven  charge  dimensions .PERIOD this  particular  choice  corresponds  to  a  grand  unified  theory  introduced  by  pati  and  salam  in  1973 .PERIOD when  we  look  at  this  new  unified  pattern ,COMMA we  can  see  a  couple  of  gaps  where  particles  seem  to  be  missing .PERIOD this  is  the  way  theories  of  unification  work .PERIOD a  physicist  looks  for  larger ,COMMA more  symmetric  patterns  that  include  the  established  pattern  as  a  subset .PERIOD the  larger  pattern  allows  us  to  predict  the  existence  of  particles  that  have  never  been  seen .PERIOD this  unification  model  predicts  the  existence  of  these  two  new  force  particles ,COMMA which  should  act  a  lot  like  the  weak  force ,COMMA only  weaker .PERIOD now  we  can  rotate  this  set  of  charges  in  seven  dimensions  and  consider  an  odd  fact  about  the  matter  particles ,COMMA the  second  and  third  generations  of  matter  have  exactly  the  same  charges  in  six-dimensional  charge  space  as  the  first  generation .PERIOD these  particles  are  not  uniquely  identified  by  their  six  charges .PERIOD they  sit  on  top  of  one  another  in  the  standard  charge  space .PERIOD however ,COMMA if  we  work  in  eight-dimensional  charge  space ,COMMA then  we  can  assign  unique  new  charges  to  each  particle .PERIOD then  we  can  spin  these  in  eight  dimensions ,COMMA and  see  what  the  whole  pattern  looks  like .PERIOD here  we  can  see  the  second  and  third  generations  of  matter  now  related  to  the  first  generation  by  a  symmetry  called  triality .PERIOD this  particular  pattern  of  charges  in  eight  dimensions  is  actually  part  of  the  most  beautiful  geometric  structure  in  mathematics .PERIOD it  's  a  pattern  of  the  largest  exceptional  lie  group ,COMMA e8 .PERIOD this  lie  group  is  a  smooth ,COMMA curved  shape  with  248  dimensions .PERIOD each  point  in  this  pattern  corresponds  to  a  symmetry  of  this  very  complex  and  beautiful  shape .PERIOD one  small  part  of  this  e8  shape  can  be  used  to  describe  the  curved  space-time  of  einstein  's  general  relativity .PERIOD explaining  gravity .PERIOD together  with  quantum  mechanics ,COMMA the  geometry  of  this  shape  could  describe  everything  about  how  the  universe  works  at  the  tiniest  scales .PERIOD the  pattern  of  this  shape  living  in  eight-dimensional  charge  space  is  exquisitely  beautiful ,COMMA and  it  summarizes  thousands  of  possible  interactions  between  these  elementary  particles ,COMMA each  of  which  is  just  a  facet  of  this  complicated  shape .PERIOD as  we  spin  it ,COMMA we  can  see  many  of  the  other  intricate  patterns .PERIOD contained  in  this  one .PERIOD and  with  a  particular  rotation ,COMMA we  can  look  down  through  this  pattern  in  eight  dimensions  along  a  symmetry  axis  and  see  all  the  particles  at  once .PERIOD it  's  a  very  beautiful  object ,COMMA and  as  with  any  unification ,COMMA we  can  see  some  holes  where  new  particles  are  required .PERIOD by  this  pattern .PERIOD there  are  20  gaps  where  new  particles  should  be ,COMMA two  of  which  have  been  filled  by  the  pati-salam  particles .PERIOD from  their  location  in  this  pattern ,COMMA we  know  that  these  new  particles  should  be  scalar  fields  like  the  higgs  particle ,COMMA but  have  color  charge  and  interact  with  the  strong  force .PERIOD filling  in  these  new  particles  completes  this  pattern ,COMMA giving  us  the  full  e8 .PERIOD this  e8  pattern  has  very  deep  mathematical  roots .PERIOD it  's  considered  by  many  to  be  the  most  beautiful  structure .PERIOD in  mathematics .PERIOD it  's  a  fantastic  prospect  that  this  object  of  great  mathematical  beauty  could  describe  the  truth  of  particle  interactions  at  the  smallest  scales  imaginable .PERIOD and  this  idea  that  nature  is  described  by  mathematics  is  not  at  all  new .PERIOD in  1623 ,COMMA galileo  wrote  this ,COMMA nature  's  grand  book ,COMMA which  stands  continually  open  to  our  gaze ,COMMA is  written  in  the  language  of  mathematics .PERIOD its  characters  are  triangles ,COMMA circles  and  other  geometrical  figures ,COMMA without  which  it  is  humanly  impossible  to  understand  a  single  word  of  it .PERIOD without  these ,COMMA one  is  wandering  around  in  a  dark  labyrinth .PERIOD i  believe  this  to  be  true ,COMMA and  i've  tried  to  follow  galileo  's  guidance  in  describing  the  mathematics  of  particle  physics  using  only  triangles ,COMMA circles  and  other  geometrical  figures .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA when  other  physicists  and  i  actually  work  on  this  stuff ,COMMA the  mathematics  can  resemble  a  dark  labyrinth .PERIOD but  it  's  reassuring  that  at  the  heart  of  this  mathematics  is  pure ,COMMA beautiful  geometry .PERIOD joined  with  quantum  mechanics ,COMMA this  mathematics  describes  our  universe  as  a  growing  e8  coral ,COMMA with  particles  interacting  at  every  location  in  all  possible  ways  according  to  a  beautiful  pattern .PERIOD and  as  more  of  the  pattern  comes  into  view  using  new  machines  like  the  large  hadron  collider ,COMMA we  may  be  able  to  see  whether  nature  uses  this  e8  pattern  or  a  different  one .PERIOD this  process  of  discovery  is  a  wonderful  adventure  to  be  involved  in .PERIOD if  the  lhc  finds  particles  that  fit  this  e8  pattern ,COMMA that  will  be  very ,COMMA very  cool .PERIOD if  the  lhc  finds  new  particles ,COMMA but  they  do  n't  fit  this  pattern ,COMMA well ,COMMA that  will  be  very  interesting ,COMMA but  bad  for  this  e8  theory .PERIOD and ,COMMA of  course ,COMMA bad  for  me  personally .PERIOD now  how  bad  would  that  be ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA pretty  bad .PERIOD but  predicting  how  nature  works  is  a  very  risky  game .PERIOD this  theory  and  others  like  it  are  long  shots .PERIOD one  does  a  lot  of  hard  work  knowing  that  most  of  these  ideas  probably  wo  n't  end  up  being  true  about  nature .PERIOD that  's  what  doing  theoretical  physics  is  like: .PERIOD there  are  a  lot  of  wipeouts .PERIOD in  this  regard ,COMMA new  physics  theories  are  a  lot  like  start-up  companies .PERIOD as  with  any  large  investment ,COMMA it  can  be  emotionally  difficult  to  abandon  a  line  of  research  when  it  is  n't  working  out .PERIOD but  in  science ,COMMA if  something  is  n't  working ,COMMA you  have  to  toss  it  out  and  try  something  else .PERIOD now ,COMMA the  only  way  to  maintain  sanity  and  achieve  happiness  in  the  midst  of  this  uncertainty  is  to  keep  balance  and  perspective  in  life .PERIOD i've  tried  the  best  i  can  to  live  a  balanced  life .PERIOD i  try  to  balance  my  life  equally  between  physics ,COMMA love  and  surfing ,COMMA my  own  three  charge  directions .PERIOD this  way ,COMMA even  if  the  physics  i  work  on  comes  to  nothing ,COMMA i  still  know  i've  lived  a  good  life .PERIOD and  i  try  to  live  in  beautiful  places .PERIOD for  most  of  the  past  ten  years  i've  lived  on  the  island  of  maui ,COMMA a  very  beautiful  place .PERIOD now  it  's  one  of  the  greatest  mysteries  in  the

.PERIOD this  was  a  view  from  my  home  office  on  maui .PERIOD and  this  is  another ,COMMA and  another .PERIOD and  you  may  have  noticed  that  these  beautiful  views  are  similar ,COMMA but  in  slightly  different  places .PERIOD that  's  because  this  used  to  be  my  home  and  office  on  maui .PERIOD i've  chosen  a  very  unusual  life .PERIOD but  not  worrying  about  rent  allowed  me  to  spend  my  time .PERIOD doing  what  i  love .PERIOD living  a  nomadic  existence  has  been  hard  at  times ,COMMA but  it  's  allowed  me  to  live  in  beautiful  places  and  keep  a  balance  in  my  life  that  i've  been  happy  with .PERIOD it  allows  me  to  spend  a  lot  of  my  time  hanging  out  with  hyper-intelligent  coral .PERIOD but  i  also  greatly  enjoy  the  company  of  hyper-intelligent  people .PERIOD so  i  'm  very  happy  to  have  been  invited  here  to  ted .PERIOD thank  you  very  much .PERIOD chris  anderson ,COMMA i  probably  understood  two  percent  of  that ,COMMA but  i  still  absolutely  loved  it .PERIOD so  i  'm  going  to  sound  dumb .PERIOD your  theory  of  everything ,COMMA garrett  lisi ,COMMA i  'm  used  to  coral .PERIOD ca ,COMMA that  's  right .PERIOD the  reason  it  's  got  a  few  people  at  least  excited  is  because ,COMMA if  you  're  right ,COMMA it  brings  gravity  and  quantum  theory  together .PERIOD so  are  you  saying  that  we  should  think  of  the  universe ,COMMA at  its  heart ,COMMA that  the  smallest  things  that  there  are ,COMMA are  somehow  an  e8  object  of  possibility ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA is  there  a  scale  to  it ,COMMA at  the  smallest  scale ,COMMA or   ?QUESTIONMARK gl ,COMMA well ,COMMA right  now  the  pattern  i  showed  you  that  corresponds  to  what  we  know  about  elementary  particle  physics ,COMMA that  already  corresponds  to  a  very  beautiful  shape .PERIOD and  that  's  the  one  that  i  said  we  knew  for  certain .PERIOD and  that  shape  has  remarkable  similarities ,COMMA and  the  way  it  fits  into  this  e8  pattern  could  be  the  rest  of  the  picture .PERIOD and  these  patterns  of  points  that  i've  shown  for  you  actually  represent  symmetries  of  this  high-dimensional  object  that  would  be  warping  and  moving  and  dancing  over  the  space  time  that  we  experience .PERIOD and  that  would  be  what  explains  all  these  elementary  particles  that  we  see .PERIOD ca ,COMMA but  a  string  theorist ,COMMA as  i  understand  it ,COMMA explains  electrons  in  terms  of  much  smaller  strings  vibrating ,COMMA i  know  you  do  n't  like  string  theory ,COMMA vibrating  inside  it .PERIOD how  should  we  think  of  an  electron  in  relation  to  e8 ?QUESTIONMARK gl ,COMMA no ,COMMA it  would  be  one  of  the  symmetries  of  this  e8  shape .PERIOD so  what  's  happening  is ,COMMA as  the  shape  is  moving  over  space-time ,COMMA it  's  twisting .PERIOD and  the  direction  it  's  twisting  as  it  moves  is  what  particle  we  see .PERIOD so  it  would  be ,COMMA ca ,COMMA the  size  of  the  e8  shape ,COMMA how  does  that  relate  to  the  electron ?QUESTIONMARK i  kind  of  feel  like  i  need  that  for  my  picture .PERIOD is  it  bigger ?QUESTIONMARK is  it  smaller ?QUESTIONMARK gl ,COMMA well ,COMMA as  far  as  we  know  electrons  are  point  particles ,COMMA so  this  would  be  going  down  to  the  smallest  possible  scales .PERIOD so  the  way  these  things  are  explained  in  quantum  field  theory  is ,COMMA all  possibilities  are  expanding  and  developing  at  once .PERIOD and  this  is  why  i  use  the  analogy  to  coral .PERIOD and  in  this  way ,COMMA the  way  that  e8  comes  in  is  it  will  be  as  a  shape  that  's  attached  at  each  point  in  space-time .PERIOD and ,COMMA as  i  said ,COMMA the  way  the  shape  twists ,COMMA the  directional  along  which  way  the  shape  is  twisting  as  it  moves  over  this  curved  surface ,COMMA is  what  the  elementary  particles  are ,COMMA themselves .PERIOD so  through  quantum  field  theory ,COMMA they  manifest  themselves  as  points  and  interact  that  way .PERIOD i  do  n't  know  if  i  'll  be  able  to  make  this  any  clearer .PERIOD ca ,COMMA it  does  n't  really  matter .PERIOD it  's  evoking  a  kind  of  sense  of  wonder ,COMMA and  i  certainly  want  to  understand  more  of  this .PERIOD but  thank  you  so  much  for  coming .PERIOD that  was  absolutely  fascinating .PERIOD those  of  you  who  know  me  know  how  passionate  i  am  about  opening  the  space  frontier .PERIOD so  when  i  had  the  chance  to  give  the  world  's  expert  in  gravity  the  experience  of  zero  gravity ,COMMA it  was  incredible .PERIOD and  i  want  to  tell  you  that  story .PERIOD i  first  met  him  through  the  archon  x  prize  for  genomics .PERIOD it  's  a  competition  we  're  holding ,COMMA the  second  x  prize ,COMMA for  the  first  team  to  sequence  100  human  genomes  in  10  days .PERIOD we  have  something  called  the  genome  100 ,COMMA 100  individuals  we  're  sequencing  as  part  of  that .PERIOD craig  venter  chairs  that  event .PERIOD and  i  met  professor  hawking ,COMMA and  he  said  his  dream  was  to  travel  into  space .PERIOD and  i  said ,COMMA i  cannot  take  you  there ,COMMA but  i  can  take  you  into  weightlessness  into  zero-g .PERIOD and  he  said ,COMMA on  the  spot ,COMMA absolutely ,COMMA yes .PERIOD well ,COMMA the  only  way  to  experience  zero-g  on  earth  is  actually  with  parabolic  flight ,COMMA weightless  flight .PERIOD you  take  an  airplane ,COMMA you  fly  over  the  top ,COMMA you  're  weightless  for  25  seconds .PERIOD come  back  down ,COMMA you  weigh  twice  as  much .PERIOD you  can  get  eight ,COMMA 10  minutes  of  weightlessness ,COMMA how  nasa  's  trained  their  astronauts  for  so  long .PERIOD we  set  out  to  do  this .PERIOD it  took  us  11  years  to  become  operational .PERIOD and  we  announced  that  we  were  going  to  fly  stephen  hawking .PERIOD we  had  one  government  agency  and  one  company  aircraft  operator  say ,COMMA you  're  crazy ,COMMA do  n't  do  that ,COMMA you  're  going  kill  the  guy .PERIOD and  he  wanted  to  go .PERIOD we  worked  hard  to  get  all  the  permissions .PERIOD and  six  months  later ,COMMA we  sat  down  at  kennedy  space  center .PERIOD we  had  a  press  conference ,COMMA we  announced  our  intent  to  do  one  zero-g  parabola ,COMMA give  him  25  seconds  of  zero-g .PERIOD and  if  it  went  really  well ,COMMA we  might  do  three  parabolas .PERIOD well ,COMMA we  asked  him  why  he  wanted  to  go  up  and  do  this .PERIOD and  what  he  said ,COMMA for  me ,COMMA was  very  moving .PERIOD he  said ,COMMA life  on  earth  is  at  an  ever-increasing  risk  of  being  wiped  out  by  disaster .PERIOD i  think  the  human  race  does  n't  have  a  future  if  it  does  n't  go  into  space .PERIOD i  therefore  want  to  encourage  public  interest  in  space .PERIOD we  took  him  out  to  the  kennedy  space  center ,COMMA up  inside  the  nasa  vehicle ,COMMA into  the  back  of  the  zero-g  airplane .PERIOD we  had  about  20  people  who  made  donations ,COMMA we  raised  $150,000  in  donations  for  children  's  charities ,COMMA who  flew  with  us .PERIOD a  few  tedsters  here .PERIOD we  set  up  a  whole  er .PERIOD we  had  four  emergency  room  doctors  and  two  nurses  on  board  the  airplane .PERIOD we  were  monitoring  his  po2  of  his  blood ,COMMA his  heart  rate ,COMMA his  blood  pressure .PERIOD we  had  everything  all  set  in  case  of  an  emergency .PERIOD god  knows ,COMMA you  do  n't  want  to  hurt  this  world-renowned  expert .PERIOD we  took  off  from  the  shuttle  landing  facility ,COMMA where  the  shuttle  takes  off  and  lands .PERIOD and  my  partner  byron  lichtenberg  and  i  carefully  suspended  him  into  zero-g .PERIOD once  he  was  there ,COMMA we  let  him  go  to  experience  what  weightlessness  was  truly  like .PERIOD and  after  that  first  parabola ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA the  doc  said  everything  is  great .PERIOD he  was  smiling ,COMMA and  we  said  go .PERIOD so  we  did  a  second  parabola .PERIOD and  a  third .PERIOD we  actually  floated  an  apple  in  homage  to  sir  isaac  newton  because  professor  hawking  holds  the  same  chair  at  cambridge  that  isaac  newton  did .PERIOD and  we  did  a  fourth ,COMMA and  a  fifth  and  a  sixth .PERIOD and  a  seventh  and  an  eighth .PERIOD and  this  man  does  not  look  like  a  65-year-old  wheelchair-bound  man .PERIOD he  was  so  happy .PERIOD we  are  living  on  a  precious  jewel ,COMMA and  it  's  during  our  lifetime  that  we  're  moving  off  this  planet .PERIOD please  join  us  in  this  epic  adventure .PERIOD thank  you  so  much .PERIOD today  i'd  like  to  show  you  the  future  of  the  way  we  make  things .PERIOD i  believe  that  soon  our  buildings  and  machines  will  be  self-assembling ,COMMA replicating  and  repairing  themselves .PERIOD so  i  'm  going  to  show  you  what  i  believe  is  the  current  state  of  manufacturing ,COMMA and  then  compare  that  to  some  natural  systems .PERIOD so  in  the  current  state  of  manufacturing ,COMMA we  have  skyscrapers ,COMMA two  and  a  half  years  of  assembly  time ,COMMA 500,000  to  a  million  parts ,COMMA fairly  complex ,COMMA new ,COMMA exciting  technologies  in  steel ,COMMA concrete ,COMMA glass .PERIOD we  have  exciting  machines  that  can  take  us  into  space ,COMMA five  years  of  assembly  time ,COMMA 25  million  parts .PERIOD but  on  the  other  side ,COMMA if  you  look  at  the  natural  systems ,COMMA we  have  proteins  that  have  two  million  types ,COMMA can  fold  in  10,000  nanoseconds ,COMMA or  dna  with  three  billion  base  pairs  we  can  replicate  in  roughly  an  hour .PERIOD so  there  's  all  of  this  complexity  in  our  natural  systems ,COMMA but  they  're  extremely  efficient ,COMMA far  more  efficient  than  anything  we  can  build ,COMMA far  more  complex  than  anything  we  can  build .PERIOD they  're  far  more  efficient  in  terms  of  energy .PERIOD they  hardly  ever  make  mistakes .PERIOD and  they  can  repair  themselves  for  longevity .PERIOD so  there  's  something  super  interesting  about  natural  systems .PERIOD and  if  we  can  translate  that  into  our  built  environment ,COMMA then  there  's  some  exciting  potential  for  the  way  that  we  build  things .PERIOD and  i  think  the  key  to  that  is  self-assembly .PERIOD so  if  we  want  to  utilize  self-assembly  in  our  physical  environment ,COMMA i  think  there  's  four  key  factors .PERIOD the  first  is  that  we  need  to  decode  all  of  the  complexity  of  what  we  want  to  build ,COMMA so  our  buildings  and  machines .PERIOD and  we  need  to  decode  that  into  simple  sequences ,COMMA basically  the  dna  of  how  our  buildings  work .PERIOD then  we  need  programmable  parts  that  can  take  that  sequence  and  use  that  to  fold  up ,COMMA or  reconfigure .PERIOD we  need  some  energy  that  's  going  to  allow  that  to  activate ,COMMA allow  our  parts  to  be  able  to  fold  up  from  the  program .PERIOD and  we  need  some  type  of  error  correction  redundancy  to  guarantee  that  we  have  successfully  built  what  we  want .PERIOD so  i  'm  going  to  show  you  a  number  of  projects  that  my  colleagues  and  i  at  mit  are  working  on  to  achieve  this  self-assembling  future .PERIOD the  first  two  are  the  macrobot  and  decibot .PERIOD so  these  projects  are  large-scale  reconfigurable  robots ,COMMA 8  ft ,COMMA 12  ft .PERIOD long  proteins .PERIOD they  're  embedded  with  mechanical  electrical  devices ,COMMA sensors .PERIOD you  decode  what  you  want  to  fold  up  into ,COMMA into  a  sequence  of  angles ,COMMA so  negative  120 ,COMMA negative  120 ,COMMA 0 ,COMMA 0 ,COMMA 120 ,COMMA negative  120 ,COMMA something  like  that .PERIOD so  a  sequence  of  angles ,COMMA or  turns ,COMMA and  you  send  that  sequence  through  the  string .PERIOD each  unit  takes  its  message ,COMMA so  negative  120  -- .PERIOD it  rotates  to  that ,COMMA checks  if  it  got  there  and  then  passes  it  to  its  neighbor .PERIOD so  these  are  the  brilliant  scientists ,COMMA engineers ,COMMA designers  that  worked  on  this  project .PERIOD and  i  think  it  really  brings  to  light ,COMMA is  this  really  scalable ?QUESTIONMARK i  mean ,COMMA thousands  of  dollars ,COMMA lots  of  man  hours  made  to  make  this  eight-foot  robot .PERIOD can  we  really  scale  this  up ?QUESTIONMARK can  we  really  embed  robotics  into  every  part ?QUESTIONMARK the  next  one  questions  that  and  looks  at  passive  nature ,COMMA or  passively  trying  to  have  reconfiguration  programmability .PERIOD but  it  goes  a  step  further ,COMMA and  it  tries  to  have  actual  computation .PERIOD it  basically  embeds  the  most  fundamental  building  block  of  computing ,COMMA the  digital  logic  gate ,COMMA directly  into  your  parts .PERIOD so  this  is  a  nand  gate .PERIOD you  have  one  tetrahedron  which  is  the  gate  that  's  going  to  do  your  computing ,COMMA and  you  have  two  input  tetrahedrons .PERIOD one  of  them  is  the  input  from  the  user ,COMMA as  you  're  building  your  bricks .PERIOD the  other  one  is  from  the  previous  brick  that  was  placed .PERIOD and  then  it  gives  you  an  output  in  3d  space .PERIOD so  what  this  means  is  that  the  user  can  start  plugging  in  what  they  want  the  bricks  to  do .PERIOD it  computes  on  what  it  was  doing  before  and  what  you  said  you  wanted  it  to  do .PERIOD and  now  it  starts  moving  in  three-dimensional  space ,COMMA so  up  or  down .PERIOD so  on  the  left-hand  side ,COMMA 1,1  input  equals  0  output ,COMMA which  goes  down .PERIOD on  the  right-hand  side ,COMMA 0,0  input  is  a  1  output ,COMMA which  goes  up .PERIOD and  so  what  that  really  means  is  that  our  structures  now  contain  the  blueprints  of  what  we  want  to  build .PERIOD so  they  have  all  of  the  information  embedded  in  them  of  what  was  constructed .PERIOD so  that  means  that  we  can  have  some  form  of  self-replication .PERIOD in  this  case  i  call  it  self-guided  replication ,COMMA because  your  structure  contains  the  exact  blueprints .PERIOD if  you  have  errors ,COMMA you  can  replace  a  part .PERIOD all  the  local  information  is  embedded  to  tell  you  how  to  fix  it .PERIOD so  you  could  have  something  that  climbs  along  and  reads  it  and  can  output  at  one  to  one .PERIOD it  's  directly  embedded .PERIOD there  's  no  external  instructions .PERIOD so  the  last  project  i  'll  show  is  called  biased  chains ,COMMA and  it  's  probably  the  most  exciting  example  that  we  have  right  now  of  passive  self-assembly  systems .PERIOD so  it  takes  the  reconfigurability  and  programmability  and  makes  it  a  completely  passive  system .PERIOD so  basically  you  have  a  chain  of  elements .PERIOD each  element  is  completely  identical ,COMMA and  they  're  biased .PERIOD so  each  chain ,COMMA or  each  element ,COMMA wants  to  turn  right  or  left .PERIOD so  as  you  assemble  the  chain ,COMMA you  're  basically  programming  it .PERIOD you  're  telling  each  unit  if  it  should  turn  right  or  left .PERIOD so  when  you  shake  the  chain ,COMMA it  then  folds  up  into  any  configuration  that  you've  programmed  in ,COMMA so  in  this  case ,COMMA a  spiral ,COMMA or  in  this  case ,COMMA two  cubes  next  to  each  other .PERIOD so  you  can  basically  program  any  three-dimensional  shape ,COMMA or  one-dimensional ,COMMA two-dimensional ,COMMA up  into  this  chain  completely  passively .PERIOD so  what  does  this  tell  us  about  the  future ?QUESTIONMARK i  think  that  it  's  telling  us  that  there  's  new  possibilities  for  self-assembly ,COMMA replication ,COMMA repair  in  our  physical  structures ,COMMA our  buildings ,COMMA machines .PERIOD there  's  new  programmability  in  these  parts .PERIOD and  from  that  you  have  new  possibilities  for  computing .PERIOD we  'll  have  spatial  computing .PERIOD imagine  if  our  buildings ,COMMA our  bridges ,COMMA machines ,COMMA all  of  our  bricks  could  actually  compute .PERIOD that  's  amazing  parallel  and  distributed  computing  power ,COMMA new  design  possibilities .PERIOD so  it  's  exciting  potential  for  this .PERIOD so  i  think  these  projects  i've  showed  here  are  just  a  tiny  step  towards  this  future ,COMMA if  we  implement  these  new  technologies  for  a  new  self-assembling  world .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  'm  a  filmmaker .PERIOD for  the  last  8  years ,COMMA i  have  dedicated  my  life  to  documenting  the  work  of  israelis  and  palestinians  who  are  trying  to  end  the  conflict  using  peaceful  means .PERIOD when  i  travel  with  my  work  across  europe  and  the  united  states ,COMMA one  question  always  comes  up ,COMMA where  is  the  palestinian  gandhi ?QUESTIONMARK why  are  n't  palestinians  using  nonviolent  resistance ?QUESTIONMARK the  challenge  i  face  when  i  hear  this  question  is  that  often  i  have  just  returned  from  the  middle  east  where  i  spent  my  time  filming  dozens  of  palestinians  who  are  using  nonviolence  to  defend  their  lands  and  water  resources  from  israeli  soldiers  and  settlers .PERIOD these  leaders  are  trying  to  forge  a  massive  national  nonviolent  movement  to  end  the  occupation  and  build  peace  in  the  region .PERIOD yet ,COMMA most  of  you  have  probably  never  heard  about  them .PERIOD this  divide  between  what  's  happening  on  the  ground  and  perceptions  abroad  is  one  of  the  key  reasons  why  we  do  n't  have  yet  a  palestinian  peaceful  resistance  movement  that  has  been  successful .PERIOD so  i  'm  here  today  to  talk  about  the  power  of  attention ,COMMA the  power  of  your  attention ,COMMA and  the  emergence  and  development  of  nonviolent  movements  in  the  west  bank ,COMMA gaza  and  elsewhere ,COMMA but  today ,COMMA my  case  study  is  going  to  be  palestine .PERIOD i  believe  that  what  's  mostly  missing  for  nonviolence  to  grow  is  not  for  palestinians  to  start  adopting  nonviolence ,COMMA but  for  us  to  start  paying  attention  to  those  who  already  are .PERIOD allow  me  to  illustrate  this  point  by  taking  you  to  this  village  called  budrus .PERIOD about  seven  years  ago ,COMMA they  faced  extinction ,COMMA because  israel  announced  it  would  build  a  separation  barrier ,COMMA and  part  of  this  barrier  would  be  built  on  top  of  the  village .PERIOD they  would  lose  40  percent  of  their  land  and  be  surrounded ,COMMA so  they  would  lose  free  access  to  the  rest  of  the  west  bank .PERIOD through  inspired  local  leadership ,COMMA they  launched  a  peaceful  resistance  campaign  to  stop  that  from  happening .PERIOD let  me  show  you  some  brief  clips ,COMMA so  you  have  a  sense  for  what  that  actually  looked  like  on  the  ground .PERIOD palestinian  woman ,COMMA we  were  told  the  wall  would  separate  palestine  from  israel .PERIOD here  in  budrus ,COMMA we  realized  the  wall  would  steal  our  land .PERIOD israeli  man ,COMMA the  fence  has ,COMMA in  fact ,COMMA created  a  solution  to  terror .PERIOD man ,COMMA today  you  're  invited  to  a  peaceful  march .PERIOD you  are  joined  by  dozens  of  your  israeli  brothers  and  sisters .PERIOD israeli  activist ,COMMA nothing  scares  the  army  more  than  nonviolent  opposition .PERIOD woman ,COMMA we  saw  the  men  trying  to  push  the  soldiers ,COMMA but  none  of  them  could  do  that .PERIOD but  i  think  the  girls  could  do  it .PERIOD fatah  party  member ,COMMA we  must  empty  our  minds  of  traditional  thinking .PERIOD hamas  party  member ,COMMA we  were  in  complete  harmony ,COMMA and  we  wanted  to  spread  it  to  all  of  palestine .PERIOD chanting ,COMMA one  united  nation .PERIOD fatah ,COMMA hamas  and  the  popular  front .PERIOD news  anchor ,COMMA the  clashes  over  the  fence  continue .PERIOD reporter ,COMMA israeli  border  police  were  sent  to  disperse  the  crowd .PERIOD they  were  allowed  to  use  any  force  necessary .PERIOD man ,COMMA these  are  live  bullets .PERIOD it  's  like  fallujah .PERIOD shooting  everywhere .PERIOD israeli  activist ,COMMA i  was  sure  we  were  all  going  to  die .PERIOD but  there  were  others  around  me  who  were  n't  even  cowering .PERIOD israeli  soldier ,COMMA a  nonviolent  protest  is  not  going  to  stop  the  unclear .PERIOD protester ,COMMA this  is  a  peaceful  march .PERIOD there  is  no  need  to  use  violence .PERIOD chanting ,COMMA we  can  do  it .PERIOD we  can  do  it .PERIOD we  can  do  it .PERIOD julia  bacha ,COMMA when  i  first  heard  about  the  story  of  budrus ,COMMA i  was  surprised  that  the  international  media  had  failed  to  cover  the  extraordinary  set  of  events  that  happened  seven  years  ago ,COMMA in  2003 .PERIOD what  was  even  more  surprising  was  the  fact  that  budrus  was  successful .PERIOD the  residents ,COMMA after  10  months  of  peaceful  resistance ,COMMA convinced  the  israeli  government  to  move  the  route  of  the  barrier  off  their  lands  and  to  the  green  line ,COMMA which  is  the  internationally  recognized  boundary  between  israel  and  the  palestinian  territories .PERIOD the  resistance  in  budrus  has  since  spread  to  villages  across  the  west  bank  and  to  palestinian  neighborhoods  in  jerusalem .PERIOD yet  the  media  remains  mostly  silent  on  these  stories .PERIOD this  silence  carries  profound  consequences  for  the  likelihood  that  nonviolence  can  grow ,COMMA or  even  survive ,COMMA in  palestine .PERIOD violent  resistance  and  nonviolent  resistance  share  one  very  important  thing  in  common .PERIOD they  are  both  a  form  of  theater  seeking  an  audience  to  their  cause .PERIOD if  violent  actors  are  the  only  ones  constantly  getting  front-page  covers  and  attracting  international  attention  to  the  palestinian  issue ,COMMA it  becomes  very  hard  for  nonviolent  leaders  to  make  the  case  to  their  communities  that  civil  disobedience  is  a  viable  option  in  addressing  their  plight .PERIOD the  power  of  attention  is  probably  going  to  come  as  no  surprise  to  the  parents  in  the  room .PERIOD the  surest  way  to  make  your  child  throw  increasingly  louder  tantrums  is  by  giving  him  attention  the  first  time  he  throws  a  fit .PERIOD the  tantrum  will  become  what  childhood  psychologists  call  a  functional  behavior ,COMMA since  the  child  has  learned  that  he  can  get  parental  attention  out  of  it .PERIOD parents  can  incentivize  or  disincentivize  behavior  simply  by  giving  or  withdrawing  attention  to  their  children .PERIOD but  that  's  true  for  adults  too .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA the  behavior  of  entire  communities  and  countries  can  be  influenced ,COMMA depending  on  where  the  international  community  chooses  to  focus  its  attention .PERIOD i  believe  that  at  the  core  of  ending  the  conflict  in  the  middle  east  and  bringing  peace  is  for  us  to  transform  nonviolence  into  a  functional  behavior  by  giving  a  lot  more  attention  to  the  nonviolent  leaders  on  the  ground  today .PERIOD in  the  course  of  taking  my  film  to  villages  in  the  west  bank ,COMMA in  gaza  and  in  east  jerusalem ,COMMA i  have  seen  the  impact  that  even  one  documentary  film  can  have  in  influencing  the  transformation .PERIOD in  a  village  called  wallajeh ,COMMA which  sits  very  close  to  jerusalem ,COMMA the  community  was  facing  a  very  similar  plight  to  budrus .PERIOD they  were  going  to  be  surrounded ,COMMA lose  a  lot  of  their  lands  and  not  have  freedom  of  access ,COMMA either  to  the  west  bank  or  jerusalem .PERIOD they  had  been  using  nonviolence  for  about  two  years  but  had  grown  disenchanted  since  nobody  was  paying  attention .PERIOD so  we  organized  a  screening .PERIOD a  week  later ,COMMA they  held  the  most  well-attended  and  disciplined  demonstration  to  date .PERIOD the  organizers  say  that  the  villagers ,COMMA upon  seeing  the  story  of  budrus  documented  in  a  film ,COMMA felt  that  there  were  indeed  people  following  what  they  were  doing ,COMMA that  people  cared .PERIOD so  they  kept  on  going .PERIOD on  the  israeli  side ,COMMA there  is  a  new  peace  movement  called  solidariot ,COMMA which  means  solidarity  in  hebrew .PERIOD the  leaders  of  this  movement  have  been  using  budrus  as  one  of  their  primary  recruiting  tools .PERIOD they  report  that  israelis  who  had  never  been  active  before ,COMMA upon  seeing  the  film ,COMMA understand  the  power  of  nonviolence  and  start  joining  their  activities .PERIOD the  examples  of  wallajeh  and  the  solidariot  movement  show  that  even  a  small-budget  independent  film  can  play  a  role  in  transforming  nonviolence  into  a  functional  behavior .PERIOD now  imagine  the  power  that  big  media  players  could  have  if  they  started  covering  the  weekly  nonviolent
