i  'm  a  savant ,COMMA or  more  precisely ,COMMA a  high-functioning  autistic  savant .PERIOD it  's  a  rare  condition .PERIOD and  rarer  still  when  accompanied ,COMMA as  in  my  case ,COMMA by  self-awareness  and  a  mastery  of  language .PERIOD very  often  when  i  meet  someone  and  they  learn  this  about  me  there  's  a  certain  kind  of  awkwardness .PERIOD i  can  see  it  in  their  eyes .PERIOD they  want  to  ask  me  something .PERIOD and  in  the  end ,COMMA quite  often ,COMMA the  urge  is  stronger  than  they  are  and  they  blurt  it  out ,COMMA if  i  give  you  my  date  of  birth ,COMMA can  you  tell  me  what  day  of  the  week  i  was  born  on ?QUESTIONMARK or  they  mention  cube  roots  or  ask  me  to  recite  a  long  number  or  long  text .PERIOD i  hope  you  'll  forgive  me  if  i  do  n't  perform  a  kind  of  one-man  savant  show  for  you  today .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  talk  instead  about  something  far  more  interesting  than  dates  of  birth  or  cube  roots ,COMMA a  little  deeper  and  a  lot  closer ,COMMA to  my  mind ,COMMA than  work .PERIOD i  want  to  talk  to  you  briefly  about  perception .PERIOD when  he  was  writing  the  plays  and  the  short  stories  that  would  make  his  name ,COMMA anton  chekhov  kept  a  notebook  in  which  he  noted  down  his  observations  of  the  world  around  him ,COMMA little  details  that  other  people  seem  to  miss .PERIOD every  time  i  read  chekhov  and  his  unique  vision  of  human  life ,COMMA i  'm  reminded  of  why  i  too  became  a  writer .PERIOD in  my  books ,COMMA i  explore  the  nature  of  perception  and  how  different  kinds  of  perceiving  create  different  kinds  of  knowing  and  understanding .PERIOD here  are  three  questions  drawn  from  my  work .PERIOD rather  than  try  to  figure  them  out ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  ask  you  to  consider  for  a  moment  the  intuitions  and  the  gut  instincts  that  are  going  through  your  head  and  your  heart  as  you  look  at  them .PERIOD for  example ,COMMA the  calculation .PERIOD can  you  feel  where  on  the  number  line  the  solution  is  likely  to  fall ?QUESTIONMARK or  look  at  the  foreign  word  and  the  sounds .PERIOD can  you  get  a  sense  of  the  range  of  meanings  that  it  's  pointing  you  towards ?QUESTIONMARK and  in  terms  of  the  line  of  poetry ,COMMA why  does  the  poet  use  the  word  hare  rather  than  rabbit ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  asking  you  to  do  this  because  i  believe  our  personal  perceptions ,COMMA you  see ,COMMA are  at  the  heart  of  how  we  acquire  knowledge .PERIOD aesthetic  judgments ,COMMA rather  than  abstract  reasoning ,COMMA guide  and  shape  the  process  by  which  we  all  come  to  know  what  we  know .PERIOD i  'm  an  extreme  example  of  this .PERIOD my  worlds  of  words  and  numbers  blur  with  color ,COMMA emotion  and  personality .PERIOD as  juan  said ,COMMA it  's  the  condition  that  scientists  call  synesthesia ,COMMA an  unusual  cross-talk  between  the  senses .PERIOD here  are  the  numbers  one  to  12  as  i  see  them ,COMMA every  number  with  its  own  shape  and  character .PERIOD one  is  a  flash  of  white  light .PERIOD six  is  a  tiny  and  very  sad  black  hole .PERIOD the  sketches  are  in  black  and  white  here ,COMMA but  in  my  mind  they  have  colors .PERIOD three  is  green .PERIOD four  is  blue .PERIOD five  is  yellow .PERIOD i  paint  as  well .PERIOD and  here  is  one  of  my  paintings .PERIOD it  's  a  multiplication  of  two  prime  numbers .PERIOD three-dimensional  shapes  and  the  space  they  create  in  the  middle  creates  a  new  shape ,COMMA the  answer  to  the  sum .PERIOD what  about  bigger  numbers ?QUESTIONMARK well  you  cannot  get  much  bigger  than  pi ,COMMA the  mathematical  constant .PERIOD it  's  an  infinite  number ,COMMA literally  goes  on  forever .PERIOD in  this  painting  that  i  made  of  the  first  20  decimals  of  pi ,COMMA i  take  the  colors  and  the  emotions  and  the  textures  and  i  pull  them  all  together  into  a  kind  of  rolling  numerical  landscape .PERIOD but  it  's  not  only  numbers  that  i  see  in  colors .PERIOD words  too ,COMMA for  me ,COMMA have  colors  and  emotions  and  textures .PERIOD and  this  is  an  opening  phrase  from  the  novel  lolita .PERIOD and  nabokov  was  himself  synesthetic .PERIOD and  you  can  see  here  how  my  perception  of  the  sound  l  helps  the  alliteration  to  jump  right  out .PERIOD another  example ,COMMA a  little  bit  more  mathematical .PERIOD and  i  wonder  if  some  of  you  will  notice  the  construction  of  the  sentence  from  the  great  gatsby .PERIOD there  is  a  procession  of  syllables ,COMMA wheat ,COMMA one .PERIOD prairies ,COMMA two .PERIOD lost  swede  towns ,COMMA three ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three .PERIOD and  this  effect  is  very  pleasant  on  the  mind ,COMMA and  it  helps  the  sentence  to  feel  right .PERIOD let  's  go  back  to  the  questions  i  posed  you  a  moment  ago .PERIOD 64  multiplied  by  75 .PERIOD if  some  of  you  play  chess ,COMMA you  'll  know  that  64  is  a  square  number ,COMMA and  that  's  why  chessboards ,COMMA eight  by  eight ,COMMA have  64  squares .PERIOD so  that  gives  us  a  form  that  we  can  picture ,COMMA that  we  can  perceive .PERIOD what  about  75 ?QUESTIONMARK well  if  100 ,COMMA if  we  think  of  100  as  being  like  a  square ,COMMA 75  would  look  like  this .PERIOD so  what  we  need  to  do  now  is  put  those  two  pictures  together  in  our  mind ,COMMA something  like  this .PERIOD 64  becomes  6,400 .PERIOD and  in  the  right-hand  corner ,COMMA you  do  n't  have  to  calculate  anything .PERIOD four  across ,COMMA four  up  and  down ,COMMA it  's  16 .PERIOD so  what  the  sum  is  actually  asking  you  to  do  is  16 ,COMMA 16 ,COMMA 16 .PERIOD that  's  a  lot  easier  than  the  school  taught  you  to  do  math ,COMMA i  'm  sure .PERIOD it  's  16 ,COMMA 16 ,COMMA 16 ,COMMA 48 ,COMMA 4,800 ,COMMA 4,000 ,COMMA the  answer  to  the  sum .PERIOD easy  when  you  know  how .PERIOD the  second  question  was  an  icelandic  word .PERIOD i  'm  assuming  there  are  not  many  people  here  who  speak  icelandic .PERIOD so  let  me  narrow  the  choices  down  to  two .PERIOD is  it  a  happy  word ,COMMA or  a  sad  word ?QUESTIONMARK what  do  you  say ?QUESTIONMARK okay .PERIOD some  people  say  it  's  happy .PERIOD most  people ,COMMA a  majority  of  people ,COMMA say  sad .PERIOD and  it  actually  means  sad .PERIOD why  do ,COMMA statistically ,COMMA a  majority  of  people  say  that  a  word  is  sad ,COMMA in  this  case ,COMMA heavy  in  other  cases ?QUESTIONMARK in  my  theory ,COMMA language  evolves  in  such  a  way  that  sounds  match ,COMMA correspond  with  the  subjective ,COMMA with  the  personal  intuitive  experience  of  the  listener .PERIOD let  's  have  a  look  at  the  third  question .PERIOD it  's  a  line  from  a  poem  by  john  keats .PERIOD words ,COMMA like  numbers ,COMMA express  fundamental  relationships  between  objects  and  events  and  forces  that  constitute  our  world .PERIOD it  stands  to  reason  that  we ,COMMA existing  in  this  world ,COMMA should  in  the  course  of  our  lives  absorb  intuitively  those  relationships .PERIOD and  poets ,COMMA like  other  artists ,COMMA play  with  those  intuitive  understandings .PERIOD in  the  case  of  hare ,COMMA it  's  an  ambiguous  sound  in  english .PERIOD it  can  also  mean  the  fibers  that  grow  from  a  head .PERIOD and  if  we  think  of  that ,COMMA let  me  put  the  picture  up ,COMMA the  fibers  represent  vulnerability .PERIOD they  yield  to  the  slightest  movement  or  motion  or  emotion .PERIOD so  what  you  have  is  an  atmosphere  of  vulnerability  and  tension .PERIOD the  hare  itself ,COMMA the  animal ,COMMA not  a  cat ,COMMA not  a  dog ,COMMA a  hare ,COMMA why  a  hare ?QUESTIONMARK because  think  of  the  picture ,COMMA not  the  word ,COMMA the  picture .PERIOD the  overlong  ears ,COMMA the  overlarge  feet ,COMMA helps  us  to  picture ,COMMA to  feel  intuitively ,COMMA what  it  means  to  limp  and  to  tremble .PERIOD so  in  these  few  minutes ,COMMA i  hope  i've  been  able  to  share  a  little  bit  of  my  vision  of  things ,COMMA and  to  show  you  that  words  can  have  colors  and  emotions ,COMMA numbers ,COMMA shapes  and  personalities .PERIOD the  world  is  richer ,COMMA vaster  than  it  too  often  seems  to  be .PERIOD i  hope  that  i've  given  you  the  desire  to  learn  to  see  the  world  with  new  eyes .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  'm  a  contemporary  artist  with  a  bit  of  an  unexpected  background .PERIOD i  was  in  my  20s  before  i  ever  went  to  an  art  museum .PERIOD i  grew  up  in  the  middle  of  nowhere  on  a  dirt  road  in  rural  arkansas ,COMMA an  hour  from  the  nearest  movie  theater .PERIOD and  i  think  it  was  a  great  place  to  grow  up  as  an  artist ,COMMA because  i  grew  up  around  quirky ,COMMA colorful  characters  who  were  great  at  making  with  their  hands .PERIOD and  my  childhood  is  more  hick  than  i  could  ever  possibly  relate  to  you ,COMMA and  also  more  intellectual  than  you  would  ever  expect .PERIOD for  instance ,COMMA me  and  my  sister ,COMMA when  we  were  little ,COMMA we  would  compete  to  see  who  could  eat  the  most  squirrel  brains .PERIOD but  on  the  other  side  of  that  though ,COMMA we  were  big  readers  in  our  house .PERIOD and  if  the  tv  was  on ,COMMA we  were  watching  a  documentary .PERIOD and  my  dad  is  the  most  voracious  reader  i  know .PERIOD he  can  read  a  novel  or  two  a  day .PERIOD but  when  i  was  little ,COMMA i  remember ,COMMA he  would  kill  flies  in  our  house  with  my  bb  gun .PERIOD and  what  was  so  amazing  to  me  about  that ,COMMA well  he  would  be  in  his  recliner ,COMMA would  holler  for  me  to  fetch  the  bb  gun ,COMMA and  i'd  go  get  it .PERIOD and  what  was  amazing  to  me ,COMMA well  it  was  pretty  kickass .PERIOD he  was  killing  a  fly  in  the  house  with  a  gun ,COMMA but  what  was  so  amazing  to  me  was  that  he  knew  just  enough  how  to  pump  it .PERIOD and  he  could  shoot  it  from  two  rooms  away  and  not  damage  what  it  was  on ,COMMA because  he  knew  how  to  pump  it  just  enough  to  kill  the  fly  and  not  damage  what  it  landed  on .PERIOD so  i  should  talk  about  art .PERIOD or  we  'll  be  here  all  day  with  my  childhood  stories .PERIOD i  love  contemporary  art ,COMMA but  i  'm  often  really  frustrated  with  the  contemporary  art  world  and  the  contemporary  art  scene .PERIOD a  few  years  ago ,COMMA i  spent  months  in  europe  to  see  the  major  international  art  exhibitions  that  have  the  pulse  of  what  is  supposed  to  be  going  on  in  the  art  world .PERIOD and  i  was  struck  by  going  to  so  many ,COMMA one  after  the  other ,COMMA with  some  clarity  of  what  it  was  that  i  was  longing  for .PERIOD and  i  was  longing  for  several  things  that  i  was  n't  getting ,COMMA or  not  getting  enough  of .PERIOD but  two  of  the  main  things ,COMMA one  of  it ,COMMA i  was  longing  for  more  work  that  was  appealing  to  a  broad  public ,COMMA that  was  accessible .PERIOD and  the  second  thing  that  i  was  longing  for  was  some  more  exquisite  craftsmanship  and  technique .PERIOD so  i  started  thinking  and  listing  what  all  it  was  that  i  thought  would  make  a  perfect  biennial .PERIOD so  i  decided ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  start  my  own  biennial .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  organize  it  and  direct  it  and  get  it  going  in  the  world .PERIOD so  i  thought ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i  have  to  have  some  criteria  of  how  to  choose  work .PERIOD so  amongst  all  the  criteria  i  have ,COMMA there  's  two  main  things .PERIOD one  of  them ,COMMA i  call  my  mimaw  's  test .PERIOD and  what  that  is  is  i  imagine  explaining  a  work  of  art  to  my  grandmother  in  five  minutes .PERIOD and  if  i  can  explain  it  in  five  minutes ,COMMA then  it  's  too  obtuse  or  esoteric  and  it  has  n't  been  refined  enough  yet .PERIOD it  needs  to  worked  on  until  it  can  speak  fluently .PERIOD and  then  my  other  second  set  of  rules ,COMMA i  hate  to  say  rules  because  it  's  art ,COMMA my  criteria  would  be  the  three  h  's ,COMMA which  is  head ,COMMA heart  and  hands .PERIOD and  great  art  would  have  head ,COMMA it  would  have  interesting  intellectual  ideas  and  concepts .PERIOD it  would  have  heart  in  that  it  would  have  passion  and  heart  and  soul .PERIOD and  it  would  have  hand  in  that  it  would  be  greatly  crafted .PERIOD so  i  started  thinking  about  how  am  i  going  to  do  this  biennial ,COMMA how  am  i  going  to  travel  the  world  and  find  these  artists .PERIOD and  then  i  realized  one  day ,COMMA there  's  an  easier  solution  to  this .PERIOD i  'm  just  going  to  make  the  whole  thing  myself .PERIOD and  so  this  is  what  i  did .PERIOD so  i  thought ,COMMA a  biennial  needs  artists .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  do  an  international  biennial ,COMMA i  need  artists  from  all  around  the  world .PERIOD so  what  i  did  was  i  invented  a  hundred  artists  from  around  the  world .PERIOD i  figured  out  their  bios ,COMMA their  their  passions  in  life  and  their  art  styles ,COMMA and  i  started  making  their  work .PERIOD i  felt ,COMMA oh  this  is  the  kind  of  project  that  i  could  spend  my  whole  life  doing .PERIOD so  i  decided ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  make  this  a  real  biennial .PERIOD it  's  going  to  be  two  years  of  studio  work .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  create  this  in  two  years .PERIOD and  i  have .PERIOD so  i  should  start  to  talk  about  these  guys .PERIOD well  the  range  is  quite  a  bit .PERIOD and  i  'm  such  a  technician ,COMMA so  i  loved  project ,COMMA getting  to  play  with  all  the  techniques .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA in  realist  paintings ,COMMA it  ranges  from  this ,COMMA which  is  kind  of  old  masters  style ,COMMA to  really  realistic  still-life ,COMMA to  this  type  of  painting  where  i  'm  painting  with  a  single  hair .PERIOD and  then  at  the  other  end ,COMMA there  's  performance  and  short  films  and  indoor  installations  like  this  indoor  installation  and  this  one ,COMMA and  outdoor  installations  like  this  one  and  this  one .PERIOD i  know  i  should  mention ,COMMA i  'm  making  all  these  things .PERIOD this  is  n't  photoshopped .PERIOD i  'm  under  the  river  with  those  fish .PERIOD so  now  let  me  introduce  some  of  my  fictional  artists  to  you .PERIOD this  is  nell  remmel .PERIOD nell  is  interested  in  agricultural  processes ,COMMA and  her  work  is  based  in  these  practices .PERIOD this  piece ,COMMA which  is  called  flipped  earth ,COMMA she  was  interested  in  taking  the  sky  and  using  it  to  cleanse  barren  ground .PERIOD and  by  taking  giant  mirrors ,COMMA and  here  she  's  taking  giant  mirrors  and  pulling  them  into  the  dirt .PERIOD and  this  is  22  ft .PERIOD long .PERIOD and  what  i  loved  about  her  work  is ,COMMA when  i  would  walk  around  it  and  look  down  into  the  sky ,COMMA looking  down  to  watch  the  sky ,COMMA and  it  unfolded  in  a  new  way .PERIOD and  probably  the  best  part  of  this  piece  is  at  dusk  and  dawn  when  the  twilight  wedge  has  fallen  and  the  ground  's  dark ,COMMA but  there  's  still  the  light  above ,COMMA bright  above .PERIOD and  so  you  're  standing  there  and  everything  else  is  dark ,COMMA but  there  's  this  portal  that  you  want  to  jump  in .PERIOD this  piece  was  great .PERIOD this  is  in  my  parents  backyard  in  arkansas .PERIOD and  i  love  to  dig  a  hole .PERIOD so  this  piece  was  great  fun ,COMMA because  it  was  two  days  of  digging  in  soft  dirt .PERIOD the  next  artist  is  kay  overstry ,COMMA and  she  's  interested  in  ephemerality  and  transience .PERIOD and  in  her  most  recent  project ,COMMA it  's  called  weather  i  made .PERIOD and  she  's  making  weather  on  her  body  's  scale .PERIOD and  this  piece  is  frost .PERIOD and  what  she  did  was  she  went  out  on  a  cold ,COMMA dry  night  and  breathed  back  and  forth  on  the  lawn  to  leave ,COMMA to  leave  her  life  's  mark ,COMMA the  mark  of  her  life .PERIOD and  so  this  is  five  foot ,COMMA five  inches  of  frost  that  she  left  behind .PERIOD the  sun  rises ,COMMA and  it  melts  away .PERIOD and  that  was  played  by  my  mom .PERIOD so  the  next  artist ,COMMA this  is  a  group  of  japanese  artists ,COMMA a  collective  of  japanese  artists ,COMMA in  tokyo .PERIOD and  they  were  interested  in  developing  a  new ,COMMA alternative  art  space .PERIOD and  they  needed  funding  for  it ,COMMA so  they  decided  to  come  up  with  some  interesting  fundraising  projects .PERIOD one  of  these  is  scratch-off  masterpieces .PERIOD and  so  what  they  're  doing ,COMMA each  of  these  artists  on  a  nine  by  seven-inch  card ,COMMA which  they  sell  for  10  bucks ,COMMA they  drew  original  works  of  art .PERIOD and  you  buy  one ,COMMA and  maybe  you  get  a  real  piece ,COMMA and  maybe  not .PERIOD well  this  has  sparked  a  craze  in  japan ,COMMA because  everyone  's  wanting  a  masterpiece .PERIOD and  the  ones  that  are  the  most  sought  after  are  the  ones  that  are  only  barely  scratched  off .PERIOD and  all  these  works ,COMMA in  some  way ,COMMA talk  about  luck  or  fate  or  chance .PERIOD those  first  two  are  portraits  of  mega-jackpot  winners  years  before  and  after  their  win .PERIOD and  in  this  one  it  's  called  drawing  the  short  stick .PERIOD i  love  these  piece  because  i  have  a  little  cousin  at  home  who  introduced  me ,COMMA which  i  think  is  such  a  great  introduction ,COMMA to  a  friend  one  day  as ,COMMA this  is  my  cousin  shea .PERIOD he  draws  sticks  real  good .PERIOD which  is  one  of  the  best  compliments  ever .PERIOD this  artist  is  gus  weinmueller ,COMMA and  he  's  doing  a  project ,COMMA a  large  project ,COMMA called  art  for  the  peoples .PERIOD and  within  this  project ,COMMA he  's  doing  a  smaller  project  called  artists  in  residence .PERIOD and  what  he  does  is ,COMMA he  spends  a  week  at  a  time  with  a  family .PERIOD and  he  shows  up  on  their  porch ,COMMA their  doorstep ,COMMA with  a  toothbrush  and  pajamas ,COMMA and  he  's  ready  to  spend  the  week  with  them .PERIOD and  using  only  what  's  present ,COMMA he  goes  in  and  makes  a  little  abode  studio  to  work  out  of .PERIOD and  he  spends  that  week  talking  to  the  family  about  what  do  they  think  great  art  is .PERIOD he  has  all  these  discussions  with  their  family .PERIOD and  he  digs  through  everything  they  have ,COMMA and  he  finds  materials  to  make  work .PERIOD and  he  makes  a  work  that  answers  what  they  think  great  art  is .PERIOD for  this  family ,COMMA he  made  this  still-life  painting .PERIOD and  whatever  he  makes  somehow  references  nesting  and  space  and  personal  property .PERIOD this  next  project ,COMMA this  is  by  jaochim  parisvega ,COMMA and  he  's  interested  in ,COMMA he  believes  art  is  everywhere  waiting ,COMMA that  it  just  needs  a  little  bit  of  a  push  to  happen .PERIOD and  he  provides  this  push  by  harnessing  natural  forces ,COMMA like  in  his  series  where  he  used  rain  to  make  paintings .PERIOD this  project  is  called  love  nests .PERIOD what  he  did  was  to  get  wild  birds  to  make  his  art  for  him .PERIOD so  he  put  the  material  in  places  where  the  birds  were  going  to  collect  them ,COMMA and  they  crafted  his  nests  for  him .PERIOD and  this  one  's  called  lovelock  's  nest .PERIOD this  one  's  called  mixtape  love  song  's  nest .PERIOD and  this  one  's  called  lovemaking  nest .PERIOD next  is  sylvia  slater .PERIOD sylvia  's  interested  in  art  training .PERIOD she  's  a  very  serious  swiss  artist .PERIOD and  she  was  thinking  about  her  friends  and  family  who  work  in  chaos-ridden  places  and  developing  countries ,COMMA and  she  was  thinking ,COMMA what  can  i  make  that  would  be  of  value  to  them ,COMMA in  case  something  bad  happens  and  they  have  to  buy  their  way  across  the  border  or  pay  off  a  gunman .PERIOD and  so  she  came  up  with  creating  these  pocket-sized  artworks  that  are  portraits  of  the  person  that  would  carry  them .PERIOD and  you  would  carry  this  around  with  you ,COMMA and  if  everything  went  to  hell ,COMMA you  could  make  payments  and  buy  your  life .PERIOD so  this  life  price  is  for  an  irrigation  non-profit  director .PERIOD so  hopefully  what  happens  is  you  never  use  it ,COMMA and  it  's  an  heirloom  that  you  pass  down .PERIOD and  she  makes  them  so  they  could  either  be  broken  up  into  payments ,COMMA or  they  could  be  like  these ,COMMA which  are  leaves  that  can  be  payments .PERIOD and  so  they  're  valuable .PERIOD this  is  precious  metals  and  gemstones .PERIOD and  this  one  had  to  get  broken  up .PERIOD he  had  to  break  off  a  piece  to  get  out  of  egypt  recently .PERIOD this  is  by  a  duo ,COMMA michael  abernathy  and  bud  holland .PERIOD and  they  're  interested  in  creating  culture ,COMMA just  tradition .PERIOD so  what  they  do  is  they  move  into  an  area  and  try  to  establish  a  new  tradition  in  a  small  geographic  area .PERIOD so  this  is  in  eastern  tennessee ,COMMA and  what  they  decided  was  that  we  need  a  positive  tradition  that  goes  with  death .PERIOD so  they  came  up  with  dig  jigs .PERIOD and  a  dig  jig ,COMMA a  dig  jig  is  where ,COMMA for  a  milestone  anniversary  or  a  birthday ,COMMA you  gather  all  your  friends  and  family  together  and  you  dance  on  where  you  're  going  to  be  buried .PERIOD and  we  got  a  lot  of  attention  when  we  did  it .PERIOD i  talked  my  family  into  doing  this ,COMMA and  they  did  n't  know  what  i  was  doing .PERIOD and  i  was  like ,COMMA get  dressed  for  a  funeral .PERIOD we  're  going  to  go  do  some  work .PERIOD and  so  we  got  to  the  grave  and  made  this ,COMMA which  was  hilarious ,COMMA the  attention  that  we  got .PERIOD so  what  happens  is  you  dance  on  the  grave .PERIOD and  after  you've  done  your  dance ,COMMA everyone  toasts  you  and  tells  you  how  great  you  are .PERIOD and  you  in  essence  have  a  funeral  that  you  get  to  be  present  for .PERIOD that  's  my  mom  and  dad .PERIOD this  is  by  jason  birdsong .PERIOD he  is  interested  in  how  we  see  as  an  animal ,COMMA how  we  are  interested  in  mimicry  and  camouflage .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA we  look  down  a  dark  alley  or  a  jungle  path ,COMMA trying  to  make  out  a  face  or  a  creature .PERIOD we  just  have  that  natural  way  of  seeing .PERIOD and  he  plays  with  this  idea .PERIOD and  this  piece ,COMMA those  are  n't  actually  leaves .PERIOD they  're  butterfly  specimens  who  have  a  natural  camouflage .PERIOD so  he  pairs  these  up .PERIOD there  's  another  pile  of  leaves .PERIOD those  are  actually  all  real  butterfly  specimens .PERIOD and  he  pairs  these  up  with  paintings .PERIOD like  this  is  a  painting  of  a  snake  in  a  box .PERIOD so  you  open  the  box  and  you  think ,COMMA who ,COMMA there  's  a  snake  in  there .PERIOD but  it  's  actually  a  painting .PERIOD so  he  makes  these  interesting  conversations  about  realism  and  mimicry  and  our  drive  to  be  fooled  by  great  camouflage

started  a  few  years  ago  getting  involved  in  health  care  and  attending  meetings  as  just  a  casual  observer ,COMMA i  noticed  that  people  would  talk  about  patients  as  if  it  was

percent  of  how  we  actually  take  care  of  our  bodies .PERIOD well  he  also  saw  that  when  health  care  turns  to  medical  care  because  of  a  more  serious  disease ,COMMA the  key  thing  that  holds  us  back  is  access  to  information .PERIOD and  when  the  web  came  along ,COMMA that  changed  everything ,COMMA because  not  only  could  we  find  information ,COMMA we  could  find  other  people  like  ourselves  who  could  gather ,COMMA who  could  bring  us  information .PERIOD and  he  coined  this  term  e-patients ,COMMA equipped ,COMMA engaged ,COMMA

 that  red  oval ,COMMA that  shadow  was  not  supposed  to  be  there .PERIOD to  make  a  long  story  short ,COMMA i  said ,COMMA so  you  need  me  to  get  back  in  there ?QUESTIONMARK he  said ,COMMA yeah ,COMMA we  're  going  to  need  to  do  a  ct  scan  of  your  chest .PERIOD and  in  parting  i  said ,COMMA is  there  anything  i  should  do ?QUESTIONMARK he  said ,COMMA think  about

.PERIOD but  what  we  saw ,COMMA this  is  an  mri  image .PERIOD this  is  much  sharper  than  an  ultrasound  would  be .PERIOD what  we  saw  in  that  kidney  was  that  big  blob  there .PERIOD and  there  were  actually  two  of  these .PERIOD one  was  growing  out  the  front  and  it  had  already  erupted ,COMMA and  it  latched  onto  the  bowel .PERIOD one  was  growing  out  the  back ,COMMA and  it  attached  to  the  soleus  muscle ,COMMA which  is  a  big  muscle  in  the  back  that  i'd  never  heard  of ,COMMA but  all  of  a  sudden  i  cared  about  it .PERIOD i  went

you  guys  to  get  married  prematurely  just  so  you  can  do  it  while  dad  's  still  alive .PERIOD it  's  really  serious .PERIOD because  if  you  wonder  why  patients  are  motivated  and

.PERIOD very  quickly  they  told  me ,COMMA kidney  cancer  is  an  uncommon  disease .PERIOD get  yourself  to  a  specialist  center .PERIOD there  is  no  cure ,COMMA but  there  's  something

and  do  n't  let  them  give  you  anything  else  first .PERIOD and  by  the  way ,COMMA here  are  four  doctors  in  your  part  of  the  united  states  who  offer  it  and  their  phone  numbers .PERIOD how  amazing  is  that ?QUESTIONMARK here  's  the  thing .PERIOD here  we  are ,COMMA four  years  later ,COMMA you  cannot  find  a  website  that  gives  patients  that  information .PERIOD

,COMMA again  i  mentioned ,COMMA where  does  my  body  end ?QUESTIONMARK my  oncologist  and  i  talk  a  lot  these  days ,COMMA because  i  try  to  keep  my  talks  technically  accurate .PERIOD and  he  said ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA the  immune  system  is  good  at  detecting  invaders ,COMMA bacteria  coming  from  outside ,COMMA but  when  it  's  your  own  tissue  that  you've  grown ,COMMA it  's  a  whole  different  thing .PERIOD and  i  went  through  a  mental  exercise  actually ,COMMA because  i  started  a  patient  support  community  of  my  own  on  a  website ,COMMA

sizes  plummeted  in  between .PERIOD just  incredible .PERIOD who  knows  what  we  'll  be  able  to  do  when  we  learn  to  make  more  use  of  it .PERIOD the  punch  line  is  that  a  year  and  a  half  later ,COMMA i  was  there  when  this  magnificent  young  woman ,COMMA my  daughter ,COMMA got  married .PERIOD and  when  she  came  down  those  steps ,COMMA and  it  was  just  her

,COMMA you  know ,COMMA if  i  have  a  nutrition  facts  label  on  the  side  of  a  cereal  box ,COMMA why  cannot  there  be  something  that  simple  telling  every  new  nurse  who  comes  on

,COMMA how  am  i  going  to  sell  more  cars  and  trucks ?QUESTIONMARK but  today  i  worry  about ,COMMA what  if  all  we  do  is  sell  more  cars  and  trucks ?QUESTIONMARK what  happens  when  the  number  of  vehicles  on  the  road  doubles ,COMMA triples ,COMMA or  even  quadruples ?QUESTIONMARK my  life  is  guided  by  two  great  passions ,COMMA and  the  first  is  automobiles .PERIOD i  literally  grew  up  with  the  ford  motor  company .PERIOD i  thought  it  was  so  cool  as  a  little  boy  when  my  dad  would  bring  home  the  latest  ford  or  lincoln  and  leave  it  in  the  driveway .PERIOD and  i  decided  about  that  time ,COMMA about  age  10 ,COMMA that  it  would  be  really  cool  if  i  was  a  test  driver .PERIOD so  my  parents  would  go  to  dinner .PERIOD they'd  sit  down ,COMMA i'd  sneak  out  of  the  house .PERIOD i'd  jump  behind  the  wheel  and  take  the  new  model  around  the  driveway ,COMMA and  it  was  a  blast .PERIOD and  that  went  on  for  about  two  years ,COMMA until ,COMMA i  think  i  was  about  12 ,COMMA my  dad  brought  home  a  lincoln  mark  iii .PERIOD and  it  was  snowing  that  day .PERIOD so  he  and  mom  went  to  dinner .PERIOD and  i  snuck  out  and  thought  it'd  be  really  cool  to  do  donuts  or  even  some  figure-eights  in  the  snow .PERIOD my  dad  finished  dinner  early  that  evening .PERIOD and  he  was  walking  to  the  front  hall  and  out  the  front  door  just  about  the  same  time  i  hit  some  ice  and  met  him  at  the  front  door  with  the  car ,COMMA and  almost  ended  up  in  the  front  hall .PERIOD so  it  kind  of  cooled  my  test  driving  for  a  little  while .PERIOD but  i  really  began  to  love  cars  then .PERIOD and  my  first  car  was  a  1975  electric-green  mustang .PERIOD and  even  though  the  color  was  pretty  hideous ,COMMA i  did  love  the  car ,COMMA and  it  really  cemented  my  love  affair  with  cars  that  's  continued  on  to  this  day .PERIOD but  cars  are  really  more  than  a  passion  of  mine .PERIOD they  quite  literally  in  my  blood .PERIOD my  great  grandfather  was  henry  ford ,COMMA and  on  my  mother  's  side ,COMMA my  great  grandfather  was  harvey  firestone .PERIOD so  when  i  was  born ,COMMA i  guess  you  could  say  expectations  were  kind  of  high  for  me .PERIOD but  my  great  grandfather ,COMMA henry  ford ,COMMA really  believed  that  the  mission  of  the  ford  motor  company  was  to  make  people  's  lives  better  and  make  cars  affordable  so  that  everyone  could  have  them .PERIOD because  he  believed  that ,COMMA with  mobility ,COMMA comes  freedom  and  progress .PERIOD and  that  's  a  belief  that  i  share .PERIOD my  other  great  passion  is  the  environment .PERIOD and  as  a  young  boy ,COMMA i  used  to  go  up  to  northern  michigan  and  fish  in  the  rivers  that  hemingway  fished  in  and  then  later  wrote  about .PERIOD and  it  really  struck  me  as  the  years  went  by ,COMMA in  a  very  negative  way ,COMMA when  i  would  go  to  some  stream  that  i'd  loved ,COMMA and  was  used  to  walking  through  this  field  that  was  once  filled  with  fireflies ,COMMA and  now  had  a  strip  mall  or  a  bunch  of  condos  on  it .PERIOD and  so  even  at  a  young  age ,COMMA that  really  resonated  with  me .PERIOD and  the  whole  notion  of  environmental  preservation ,COMMA at  a  very  basic  level ,COMMA sunk  in  with  me .PERIOD as  a  high-schooler ,COMMA i  started  to  read  authors  like  thoreau  and  aldo  leopold  and  edward  abbey .PERIOD and  i  really  began  to  develop  a  deeper  appreciation  of  the  natural  world .PERIOD but  it  never  really  occurred  to  me  that  my  love  of  cars  and  trucks  would  ever  be  in  conflict  with  nature .PERIOD and  that  was  true  until  i  got  to  college .PERIOD and  when  i  got  to  college ,COMMA you  can  imagine  my  surprise  when  i  would  go  to  class  and  a  number  of  my  professors  would  say  that  ford  motor  company  and  my  family  was  everything  that  was  wrong  with  our  country .PERIOD they  thought  that  we  were  more  interested ,COMMA as  an  industry ,COMMA in  profits ,COMMA rather  than  progress ,COMMA and  that  we  filled  the  skies  with  smog ,COMMA and  frankly ,COMMA we  were  the  enemy .PERIOD i  joined  ford  after  college ,COMMA after  some  soul  searching  whether  or  not  this  is  really  the  right  thing  to  do .PERIOD but  i  decided  that  i  wanted  to  go  and  see  if  i  could  affect  change  there .PERIOD and  as  i  look  back  over  30  years  ago ,COMMA it  was  a  little  naive  to  think  at  that  age  that  i  could ,COMMA but  i  wanted  to .PERIOD and  i  really  discovered  that  my  professors  were  n't  completely  wrong .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA when  i  got  back  to  detroit ,COMMA my  environmental  leanings  were  n't  exactly  embraced  by  those  in  my  own  company ,COMMA and  certainly  by  those  in  the  industry .PERIOD i  had  some  very  interesting  conversations ,COMMA as  you  can  imagine .PERIOD there  were  some  within  ford  who  believed  that  all  this  ecological  nonsense  should  just  disappear  and  that  i  needed  to  stop  hanging  out  with  environmental  wackos .PERIOD i  was  considered  a  radical .PERIOD and  i  'll  never  forget  the  day  i  was  called  in  by  a  member  of  top  management  and  told  to  stop  associating  with  any  known  or  suspected  environmentalists .PERIOD of  course ,COMMA i  had  no  intention  of  doing  that .PERIOD and  i  kept  speaking  out  about  the  environment .PERIOD and  it  really  was  the  topic  that  we  now  today  sustainability .PERIOD and  in  time ,COMMA my  views  went  from  controversial  to  more  or  less  consensus  today .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA i  think  most  people  in  the  industry  understand  that  we've  got  to  get  on  with  it .PERIOD and  the  good  news  is  today  we  are  tackling  the  big  issues ,COMMA of  cars  and  the  environment ,COMMA not  only  at  ford ,COMMA but  really  as  an  industry .PERIOD we  're  pushing  fuel  efficiency  to  new  heights .PERIOD and  with  new  technology ,COMMA we  're  reducing ,COMMA and  i  believe ,COMMA someday  will  eliminate ,COMMA co2  emissions .PERIOD we  're  starting  to  sell  electric  cars ,COMMA which  is  great .PERIOD we  're  developing  alternative  power  trains  that  are  going  to  make  cars  affordable  in  every  sense  of  the  word ,COMMA economically ,COMMA socially  and  environmentally .PERIOD and  actually ,COMMA although  we've  got  a  long  way  to  go  and  a  lot  of  work  to  do ,COMMA i  can  see  the  day  where  my  two  great  passions ,COMMA cars  and  the  environment ,COMMA actually  come  into  harmony .PERIOD but  unfortunately ,COMMA as  we  're  on  our  way  to  solving  one  monstrous  problem ,COMMA and  as  i  said ,COMMA we  're  not  there  yet .PERIOD we've  got  a  lot  of  work  to  do ,COMMA but  i  can  see  where  we  will ,COMMA but  even  as  we  're  in  the  process  of  doing  that ,COMMA another  huge  problem  is  looming ,COMMA and  people  are  n't  noticing .PERIOD and  that  is  the  freedom  of  mobility  that  my  great  grandfather  brought  to  people  is  now  being  threatened ,COMMA just  as  the  environment  is .PERIOD the  problem ,COMMA put  in  its  simplest  terms ,COMMA is  one  of  mathematics .PERIOD today  there  are  approximately  68  billion  people  in  the  world .PERIOD and  within  our  lifetime ,COMMA that  number  's  going  to  grow  to  about  nine  billion .PERIOD and  at  that  population  level ,COMMA our  planet  will  be  dealing  with  the  limits  of  growth .PERIOD and  with  that  growth  comes  some  severe  practical  problems ,COMMA one  of  which  is  our  transportation  system  simply  wo  n't  be  able  to  deal  with  it .PERIOD when  we  look  at  the  population  growth  in  terms  of  cars ,COMMA it  becomes  even  clearer .PERIOD today  there  are  about  800  million  cars  on  the  road  worldwide .PERIOD but  with  more  people  and  greater  prosperity  around  the  world ,COMMA that  number  's  going  to  grow  to  between  two  and  four  billion  cars  by  mid  century .PERIOD and  this  is  going  to  create  the  kind  of  global  gridlock  that  the  world  has  never  seen  before .PERIOD now  think  about  the  impact  that  this  is  going  to  have  on  our  daily  lives .PERIOD today  the  average  american  spends  about  a  week  a  year  stuck  in  traffic  jams .PERIOD and  that  's  a  huge  waste  of  time  and  resources .PERIOD but  that  's  nothing  compared  to  what  's  going  on  in  the  nations  that  are  growing  the  fastest .PERIOD today  the  average  driver  in  beijing  has  a  five-hour  commute .PERIOD and  last  summer ,COMMA many  of  you  probably  saw  this ,COMMA there  was  a  hundred-mile  traffic  jam  that  took  11  days  to  clear  in  china .PERIOD in  the  decades  to  come ,COMMA 75  percent  of  the  world  's  population  will  live  in  cities ,COMMA and  50  of  those  cities  will  be  of  10  million  people  or  more .PERIOD so  you  can  see  the  size  of  the  issue  that  we  're  facing .PERIOD when  you  factor  in  population  growth ,COMMA it  's  clear  that  mobility  model  that  we  have  today  simply  will  not  work  tomorrow .PERIOD frankly ,COMMA four  billion  clean  cars  on  the  road  are  still  four  billion  cars .PERIOD and  a  traffic  jam  with  no  emissions  is  still  a  traffic  jam .PERIOD so ,COMMA if  we  make  no  changes  today ,COMMA what  does  tomorrow  look  like ?QUESTIONMARK well  i  think  you  probably  already  have  the  picture .PERIOD traffic  jams  are  just  a  symptom  of  this  challenge ,COMMA and  they  're  really  very ,COMMA very  inconvenient ,COMMA but  that  's  all  they  are .PERIOD but  the  bigger  issue  is  that  global  gridlock  is  going  to  stifle  economic  growth  and  our  ability  to  deliver  food  and  health  care ,COMMA particularly  to  people  that  live  in  city  centers .PERIOD and  our  quality  of  life  is  going  to  be  severely  compromised .PERIOD so  what  's  going  to  solve  this ?QUESTIONMARK well  the  answer  is  n't  going  to  be  more  of  the  same .PERIOD my  great  grandfather  once  said  before  he  invented  the  model  t ,COMMA if  i  had  asked  people  then  what  they  wanted ,COMMA they  would  have  answered ,COMMA we  want  faster  horses  so  the  answer  to  more  cars  is  simply  not  to  have  more  roads .PERIOD when  america  began  moving  west ,COMMA we  did  n't  add  more  wagon  trains ,COMMA we  built  railroads .PERIOD and  to  connect  our  country  after  world  war  ii ,COMMA we  did  n't  build  more  two-lane  highways ,COMMA we  built  the  interstate  highway  system .PERIOD today  we  need  that  same  leap  in  thinking  for  us  to  create  a  viable  future .PERIOD we  are  going  to  build  smart  cars ,COMMA but  we  also  need  to  build  smart  roads ,COMMA smart  parking ,COMMA smart  public  transportation  systems  and  more .PERIOD we  do  n't  want  to  waste  our  time  sitting  in  traffic ,COMMA sitting  at  toll  booths  or  looking  for  parking  spots .PERIOD we  need  an  integrated  system  that  uses  real  time  data  to  optimize  personal  mobility  on  a  massive  scale  without  hassle  or  compromises  for  travelers .PERIOD and  frankly ,COMMA that  's  the  kind  of  system  that  's  going  to  make  the  future  of  personal  mobility  sustainable .PERIOD now  the  good  news  is  some  of  this  work  has  already  begun  in  different  parts  of  the  world .PERIOD the  city  of  masdar  in  abu  dhabi  uses  driverless  electric  vehicles  that  can  communicate  with  one  another ,COMMA and  they  go  underneath  the  city  streets .PERIOD and  up  above ,COMMA you've  got  a  series  of  pedestrian  walkways .PERIOD on  new  york  city  's  34th  st ,COMMA gridlock  will  soon  be  replaced  with  a  connected  system  of  vehicle-specific  corridors .PERIOD pedestrian  zones  and  dedicated  traffic  lanes  are  going  to  be  created ,COMMA and  all  of  this  will  cut  down  the  average  rush  hour  commute  to  get  across  town  in  new  york  from  about  an  hour  today  at  rush  hour  to  about  20  minutes .PERIOD now  if  you  look  at  hong  kong ,COMMA they  have  a  very  interesting  system  called  octopus  there .PERIOD it  's  a  system  that  really  ties  together  all  the  transportation  assets  into  a  single  payment  system .PERIOD so  parking  garages ,COMMA buses ,COMMA trains ,COMMA they  all  operate  within  the  same  system .PERIOD now  shared  car  services  are  also  springing  up  around  the  world .PERIOD and  these  efforts ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA are  great .PERIOD they  're  relieving  congestion ,COMMA and  they  're  frankly  starting  to  save  some  fuel .PERIOD these  are  all  really  good  ideas  that  will  move  us  forward .PERIOD but  what  really  inspires  me  is  what  's  going  to  be  possible  when  our  cars  can  begin  talking  to  each  other .PERIOD very  soon ,COMMA the  same  systems  that  we  use  today  to  bring  music  and  entertainment  and  gps  information  into  our  vehicles  are  going  to  be  used  to  create  a  smart  vehicle  network .PERIOD every  morning  i  drive  about  30  miles  from  my  home  in  ann  arbor  to  my  office  in  dearborn ,COMMA michigan .PERIOD and  every  night  i  go  home ,COMMA my  commute  is  a  total  crap  shoot .PERIOD and  i  often  have  to  leave  the  freeway  and  look  for  different  ways  for  me  to  try  and  make  it  home .PERIOD but  very  soon  we  're  going  to  see  the  days  when  cars  are  essentially  talking  to  each  other .PERIOD so  if  the  car  ahead  of  me  on  i-94  hits  traffic ,COMMA it  will  immediately  alert  my  car  and  tell  my  car  to  reroute  itself  to  get  me  home  in  the  best  possible  way .PERIOD and  these  systems  are  being  tested  right  now ,COMMA and  frankly  they  're  going  to  be  ready  for  prime  time  pretty  soon .PERIOD but  the  potential  of  a  connected  car  network  is  almost  limitless .PERIOD one  day  very  soon ,COMMA you  're  going  to  be  able  to  plan  a  trip  downtown  and  your  car  will  be  connected  to  a  smart  parking  system .PERIOD so  you  get  in  your  car ,COMMA and  as  you  get  in  your  car ,COMMA your  car  will  reserve  you  a  parking  spot  before  you  arrive ,COMMA no  more  driving  around  looking  for  one ,COMMA which  frankly  is  one  of  the  biggest  users  of  fuel  in  today  's  cars  in  urban  areas  is  looking  for  parking  spots .PERIOD or  think  about  being  in  new  york  city  and  tracking  down  an  intelligent  cab  on  your  smart  phone  so  you  do  n't  have  to  wait  in  the  cold  to  hail  one .PERIOD or  being  at  a  future  ted  conference  and  having  your  car  talk  to  the  calendars  of  everybody  here  and  telling  you  all  the  best  route  to  take  home  and  when  you  should  leave ,COMMA so  that  you  can  all  arrive  at  your  next  destination  on  time .PERIOD this  is  the  kind  of  technology  that  will  merge  millions  of  individual  vehicles  into  a  single  system .PERIOD so  i  think  it  's  clear  we  have  the  beginnings  of  a  solution  to  this  enormous  problem .PERIOD but  as  we  found  out  with  addressing  co2  issues ,COMMA and  also  fossil  fuels ,COMMA there  is  no  one  silver  bullet .PERIOD the  solution  is  not  going  to  be  more  cars ,COMMA more  roads  or  a  new  rail  system .PERIOD it  can  only  be  found ,COMMA i  believe ,COMMA in  a  global  network  of  interconnected  solutions .PERIOD now  i  know  we  can  develop  the  technology  that  's  going  to  make  this  work ,COMMA but  we've  got  to  be  willing  to  get  out  there  and  seek  out  the  solutions ,COMMA whether  that  means  vehicle  sharing  or  public  transportation  or  some  other  way  we  have  n't  even  thought  of  yet ,COMMA our  overall  transportation  mix  and  infrastructure  must  support  all  the  future  options .PERIOD we  need  our  best  and  our  brightest  to  start  entertaining  this  issue .PERIOD companies ,COMMA entrepreneurs ,COMMA venture  capitalists ,COMMA they  all  need  to  understand  this  is  a  huge  business  opportunity ,COMMA as  well  as  an  enormous  social  problem .PERIOD and  just  as  these  groups  embrace  the  green  energy  challenge ,COMMA and  it  's  really  been  amazing  to  me  to  watch  how  much  brain  power ,COMMA how  much  money  and  how  much  serious  thought  has ,COMMA really  over  the  last  three  years ,COMMA just  poured  into  the  green  energy  field .PERIOD we  need  that  same  kind  of  passion  and  energy  to  attack  global  gridlock .PERIOD but  we  need  people  like  all  of  you  in  this  room ,COMMA leading  thinkers .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA frankly  i  need  all  of  you  to  think  about  how  you  can  help  solve  this  huge  issue .PERIOD and  we  need  people  from  all  walks  of  life .PERIOD not  just  inventors ,COMMA we  need  policymakers  and  government  officials  to  also  think  about  how  they  're  going  to  respond  to  this  challenge .PERIOD this  is  n't  going  to  be  solved  by  any  one  person  or  one  group .PERIOD it  's  going  to  really  require  a  national  energy  policy ,COMMA frankly  for  each  country ,COMMA because  the  solutions  in  each  country  are  going  to  be  different  based  upon  income  levels ,COMMA traffic  jams  and  also  how  integrated  the  systems  already  are .PERIOD but  we  need  to  get  going ,COMMA and  we  need  to  get  going  today .PERIOD and  we  must  have  an  infrastructure  that  's  designed  to  support  this  flexible  future .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA we've  come  a  long  way .PERIOD since  the  model  t ,COMMA most  people  never  traveled  more  than  25  miles  from  home  in  their  entire  life  time .PERIOD and  since  then ,COMMA the  automobile  has  allowed  us  the  freedom  to  choose  where  we  live ,COMMA where  we  work ,COMMA where  we  play  and  frankly  when  we  just  go  out  and  want  to  move  around .PERIOD we  do  n't  want  to  regress  and  lose  that  freedom .PERIOD we  're  on  our  way  to  solving ,COMMA and  as  i  said  earlier ,COMMA i  know  we've  got  a  long  way  to  go ,COMMA the  one  big  issue  that  we  're  all  focused  on  that  threatens  it ,COMMA and  that  's  the  environmental  issue ,COMMA but  i  believe  we  all  must  turn  all  of  our  effort  and  all  of  our  ingenuity  and  determination  to  help  now  solve  this  notion  of  global  gridlock .PERIOD because  in  doing  so ,COMMA we  're  going  to  preserve  what  we've  really  come  to  take  for  granted ,COMMA which  is  the  freedom  to  move  and  move  very  effortlessly  around  the  world .PERIOD and  it  frankly  will  enhance  our  quality  of  life  if  we  fix  this .PERIOD because ,COMMA if  you  can  envision ,COMMA as  i  do ,COMMA a  future  of  zero  emissions  and  freedom  to  move  around  the  country  and  around  the  world  like  we  take  for  granted  today ,COMMA that  's  worth  the  hard  work  today  to  preserve  that  for  tomorrow .PERIOD i  believe  we  're  at  our  best  when  we  're  confronted  with  big  issues .PERIOD this  is  a  big  one ,COMMA and  it  wo  n't  wait .PERIOD so  let  's  get  started  now .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD the  highline  is  an  old ,COMMA elevated  rail  line  that  runs  for  a  mile  and  a  half  right  through  manhattan .PERIOD and  it  was  originally  a  freight  line  that  ran  down  10th  ave .PERIOD and  it  became  known  as  death  avenue  because  so  many  people  were  run  over  by  the  trains  that  the  railroad  hired  a  guy  on  horseback  to  run  in  front ,COMMA and  he  became  known  as  the  west  side  cowboy .PERIOD but  even  with  a  cowboy ,COMMA about  one  person  a  month  was  killed  and  run  over .PERIOD so  they  elevated  it .PERIOD they  built  it  30  ft .PERIOD in  the  air ,COMMA right  through  the  middle  of  the  city .PERIOD but  with  the  rise  of  interstate  trucking ,COMMA it  was  used  less  and  less .PERIOD and  by  1980 ,COMMA the  last  train  rode .PERIOD it  was  a  train  loaded  with  frozen  turkeys ,COMMA they  say ,COMMA at  thanksgiving ,COMMA from  the  meatpacking  district .PERIOD and  then  it  was  abandoned .PERIOD and  i  live  in  the  neighborhood ,COMMA and  i  first  read  about  it  in  the  new  york  times ,COMMA in  an  article  that  said  it  was  going  to  be  demolished .PERIOD and  i  assumed  someone  was  working  to  preserve  it  or  save  it  and  i  could  volunteer ,COMMA but  i  realized  no  one  was  doing  anything .PERIOD i  went  to  my  first  community  board  meeting ,COMMA which  i'd  never  been  to  one  before ,COMMA and  sat  next  to  another  guy  named  joshua  david ,COMMA who  's  a  travel  writer .PERIOD and  at  the  end  of  the  meeting ,COMMA we  realized  we  were  the  only  two  people  that  were  sort  of  interested  in  the  project .PERIOD most  people  wanted  to  tear  it  down .PERIOD so  we  exchanged  business  cards ,COMMA and  we  kept  calling  each  other  and  decided  to  start  this  organization ,COMMA friends  of  the  high  line .PERIOD and  the  goal  at  first  was  just  saving  it  from  demolition ,COMMA but  then  we  also  wanted  to  figure  out  what  we  could  do  with  it .PERIOD and  what  first  attracted  me ,COMMA or  interested  me ,COMMA was  this  view  from  the  street ,COMMA which  is  this  steel  structure ,COMMA sort  of  rusty ,COMMA this  industrial  relic .PERIOD but  when  i  went  up  on  top ,COMMA it  was  a  mile  and  a  half  of  wildflowers  running  right  through  the  middle  of  manhattan  with  views  of  the  empire  state  building  and  the  statue  of  liberty  and  the  hudson  river .PERIOD and  that  's  really  where  we  started ,COMMA the  idea  coalesced  around ,COMMA let  's  make  this  a  park ,COMMA and  let  's  have  it  be  sort  of  inspired  by  this  wildscape .PERIOD at  the  time ,COMMA there  was  a  lot  of  opposition .PERIOD mayor  giuliani  wanted  to  tear  it  down .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  fast-forward  through  a  lot  of  lawsuits  and  a  lot  of  community  engagement .PERIOD mayor  bloomberg  came  in  office ,COMMA he  was  very  supportive ,COMMA but  we  still  had  to  make  the  economic  case .PERIOD this  was  after  9/11 .PERIOD the  city  was  in  tough  times .PERIOD so  we  commissioned  an  economic  feasibility  study  to  try  to  make  the  case .PERIOD and  it  turns  out ,COMMA we  got  those  numbers  wrong .PERIOD we  thought  it  would  cost  100  million  dollars  to  build .PERIOD so  far  it  's  cost  about  150  million .PERIOD and  the  main  case  was ,COMMA this  is  going  to  make  good  economic  sense  for  the  city .PERIOD so  we  said  over  a  20-year  time  period ,COMMA the  value  to  the  city  in  increased  property  values  and  increased  taxes  would  be  about  250  million .PERIOD that  was  enough .PERIOD it  really  got  the  city  behind  it .PERIOD it  turns  out  we  were  wrong  on  that .PERIOD now  people  estimate  it  's  created  about  a  half  a  billion  dollars ,COMMA or  will  create  about  a  half  a  billion  dollars ,COMMA in  tax  revenues  for  the  city .PERIOD we  did  a  design  competition ,COMMA selected  a  design  team .PERIOD we  worked  with  them  to  really  create  a  design  that  was  inspired  by  that  wildscape .PERIOD there  's  three  sections .PERIOD we  opened  the  fist  section  in  2009 .PERIOD it  's  been  successful  beyond  our  dreams .PERIOD last  year  we  had  about  two  million  people ,COMMA which  is  about  10  times  what  we  ever  estimated .PERIOD this  is  one  of  my  favorite  features  in  section  one .PERIOD it  's  this  amphitheater  right  over  10th  ave .PERIOD and  the  first  section  ends  at  20th  st .PERIOD right  now .PERIOD the  other  thing ,COMMA it  's  generated ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA a  lot  of  economic  value .PERIOD it  's  also  inspired ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA a  lot  of  great  architecture .PERIOD there  's  a  point ,COMMA you  can  stand  here  and  see  buildings  by  frank  gehry ,COMMA jean  nouvel ,COMMA shigeru  ban ,COMMA neil  denari .PERIOD and  the  whitney  is  moving  downtown  and  is  building  their  new  museum  right  at  the  base  of  the  high  line .PERIOD and  this  has  been  designed  by  renzo  piano .PERIOD and  they  're  going  to  break  ground  in  may .PERIOD and  we've  already  started  construction  on  section  two .PERIOD this  is  one  of  my  favorite  features ,COMMA this  flyover  where  you  're  eight  feet  off  the  surface  of  the  high  line ,COMMA running  through  a  canopy  of  trees .PERIOD the  high  line  used  to  be  covered  in  billboards ,COMMA and  so  we've  taken  a  playful  take  where ,COMMA instead  of  framing  advertisements ,COMMA it  's  going  to  frame  people  in  views  of  the  city .PERIOD this  was  just  installed  last  month .PERIOD and  then  the  last  section  was  going  to  go  around  the  rail  yards ,COMMA which  is  the  largest  undeveloped  site  in  manhattan .PERIOD and  the  city  has  planned ,COMMA for  better  or  for  worse ,COMMA 12  million  square-feet  of  development  that  the  high  line  is  going  to  ring  around .PERIOD but  what  really ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA makes  the  high  line  special  is  the  people .PERIOD and  honestly ,COMMA even  though  i  love  the  designs  that  we  were  building ,COMMA i  was  always  frightened  that  i  would  n't  really  love  it ,COMMA because  i  fell  in  love  with  that  wildscape ,COMMA and  how  could  you  recreate  that  magic ?QUESTIONMARK but  what  i  found  is  it  's  in  the  people  and  how  they  use  it  that ,COMMA to  me ,COMMA makes  it  so  special .PERIOD just  one  quick  example  is  i  realized  right  after  we  opened  that  there  were  all  these  people  holding  hands  on  the  high  line .PERIOD and  i  realized  new  yorkers  do  n't  hold  hands .PERIOD we  just  do  n't  do  that  outside .PERIOD but  you  see  that  happening  on  the  high  line ,COMMA and  i  think  that  's  the  power  that  public  space  can  have  to  transform  how  people  experience  their  city  and  interact  with  each  other .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD a  few  years  ago ,COMMA i  felt  like  i  was  stuck  in  a  rut ,COMMA so  i  decided  to  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  the  great  american  philosopher ,COMMA morgan  spurlock ,COMMA and  try  something  new  for  30  days .PERIOD the  idea  is  actually  pretty  simple .PERIOD think  about  something  you've  always  wanted  to  add  to  your  life  and  try  it  for  the  next  30  days .PERIOD it  turns  out ,COMMA 30  days  is  just  about  the  right  amount  of  time  to  add  a  new  habit  or  subtract  a  habit ,COMMA like  watching  the  news ,COMMA from  your  life .PERIOD there  's  a  few  things  i  learned  while  doing  these  30-day  challenges .PERIOD the  first  was ,COMMA instead  of  the  months  flying  by ,COMMA forgotten ,COMMA the  time  was  much  more  memorable .PERIOD this  was  part  of  a  challenge  i  did  to  take  a  picture  everyday  for  a  month .PERIOD and  i  remember  exactly  where  i  was  and  what  i  was  doing  that  day .PERIOD i  also  noticed  that  as  i  started  to  do  more  and  harder  30-day  challenges ,COMMA my  self-confidence  grew .PERIOD i  went  from  desk-dwelling  computer  nerd  to  the  kind  of  guy  who  bikes  to  work ,COMMA for  fun .PERIOD even  last  year ,COMMA i  ended  up  hiking  up  mt .PERIOD kilimanjaro ,COMMA the  highest  mountain  in  africa .PERIOD i  would  never  have  been  that  adventurous  before  i  started  my  30-day  challenges .PERIOD i  also  figured  out  that  if  you  really  want  something  badly  enough ,COMMA you  can  do  anything  for  30  days .PERIOD have  you  ever  wanted  to  write  a  novel ?QUESTIONMARK every  november ,COMMA tens  of  thousands  of  people  try  to  write  their  own  50,000  word  novel  from  scratch  in  30  days .PERIOD it  turns  out ,COMMA all  you  have  to  do  is  write  1,667  words  a  day  for  a  month .PERIOD so  i  did .PERIOD by  the  way ,COMMA the  secret  is  not  to  go  to  sleep  until  you've  written  your  words  for  the  day .PERIOD you  might  be  sleep-deprived ,COMMA but  you  'll  finish  your  novel .PERIOD now  is  my  book  the  next  great  american  novel ?QUESTIONMARK no .PERIOD i  wrote  it  in  a  month .PERIOD it  's  awful .PERIOD but  for  the  rest  of  my  life ,COMMA if  i  meet  john  hodgman  at  a  ted  party ,COMMA i  do  n't  have  to  say ,COMMA i  'm  a  computer  scientist .PERIOD no ,COMMA no ,COMMA if  i  want  to  i  can  say ,COMMA i  'm  a  novelist .PERIOD so  here  's  one  last  thing  i'd  like  to  mention .PERIOD i  learned  that  when  i  made  small ,COMMA sustainable  changes ,COMMA things  i  could  keep  doing ,COMMA they  were  more  likely  to  stick .PERIOD there  's  nothing  wrong  with  big ,COMMA crazy  challenges .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA they  're  a  ton  of  fun .PERIOD but  they  're  less  likely  to  stick .PERIOD when  i  gave  up  sugar  for  30  days ,COMMA day  31  looked  like  this .PERIOD so  here  's  my  question  to  you ,COMMA what  are  you  waiting  for ?QUESTIONMARK i  guarantee  you  the  next  30  days  are  going  to  pass  whether  you  like  it  or  not ,COMMA so  why  not  think  about  something  you  have  always  wanted  to  try  and  give  it  a  shot  for  the  next  30  days .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD good  morning  everybody .PERIOD i  work  with  really  amazing  little  itty  bitty  creatures  called  cells .PERIOD and  let  me  tell  you  what  it  's  like  to  grow  these  cells  in  the  lab .PERIOD i  work  in  a  lab  where  we  take  cells  out  of  their  native  environment .PERIOD we  plate  them  into  dishes  that  we  sometimes  call  petri  dishes .PERIOD and  we  feed  them ,COMMA sterilly  of  course ,COMMA with  what  we  call  cell  culture  media ,COMMA which  is  like  their  food ,COMMA and  we  grow  them  in  incubators .PERIOD why  do  i  do  this ?QUESTIONMARK we  observe  the  cells  in  a  plate ,COMMA and  they  're  just  on  the  surface .PERIOD but  what  we  're  really  trying  to  do  in  my  lab  is  to  engineer  tissues  out  of  them .PERIOD what  does  that  even  mean ?QUESTIONMARK well  it  means  growing  an  actual  heart ,COMMA let  's  say ,COMMA or  grow  a  piece  of  bone  that  can  be  put  into  the  body .PERIOD not  only  that ,COMMA but  they  can  also  be  used  for  disease  models .PERIOD and  for  this  purpose ,COMMA traditional  cell  culture  techniques  just  really  are  n't  enough .PERIOD the  cells  are  kind  of  homesick .PERIOD the  dish  does  n't  feel  like  their  home .PERIOD and  so  we  need  to  do  better  at  copying  their  natural  environment  to  get  them  to  thrive .PERIOD we  call  this  the  biomimetic  paradigm ,COMMA copying  nature  in  the  lab .PERIOD let  's  take  the  example  of  the  heart ,COMMA the  topic  of  a  lot  of  my  research .PERIOD what  makes  the  heart  unique ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  heart  beats ,COMMA rhythmically ,COMMA tirelessly ,COMMA faithfully .PERIOD we  copy  this  in  the  lab  by  outfitting  cell  culture  systems  with  electrodes .PERIOD these  electrodes  act  like  mini  pacemakers  to  get  the  cells  to  contract  in  the  lab .PERIOD what  else  do  we  know  about  the  heart ?QUESTIONMARK well  heart  cells  are  pretty  greedy .PERIOD nature  feeds  the  heart  cells  in  your  body  with  a  very ,COMMA very  dense  blood  supply .PERIOD in  the  lab ,COMMA we  micro-pattern  channels  in  the  biomaterials  on  which  we  grow  the  cells .PERIOD and  this  allows  us  to  flow  the  cell  culture  media ,COMMA the  cells  food ,COMMA through  the  scaffolds  where  we  're  growing  the  cells ,COMMA a  lot  like  what  you  might  expect  from  a  capillary  bed  in  the  heart .PERIOD so  this  brings  me  to  lesson  number  one ,COMMA life  can  do  a  lot  with  very  little .PERIOD let  's  take  the  example  of  electrical  stimulation .PERIOD let  's  see  how  powerful  just  one  of  these  essentials  can  be .PERIOD on  the  left ,COMMA we  see  a  tiny  piece  of  beating  heart  tissue  that  i  engineered  from  rat  cells  in  the  lab .PERIOD it  's  about  the  size  of  a  mini  marshmallow .PERIOD and  after  one  week ,COMMA it  's  beating .PERIOD you  can  see  it  in  the  upper  left-hand  corner .PERIOD but  do  n't  worry  if  you  cannot  see  it  so  well .PERIOD it  's  amazing  that  these  cells  beat  at  all .PERIOD but  what  's  really  amazing  is  that  the  cells ,COMMA when  we  electrically  stimulate  them  like  with  a  pacemaker ,COMMA that  they  beat  so  much  more .PERIOD but  that  brings  me  to  lesson  number  two ,COMMA cells  do  all  the  work .PERIOD in  a  sense ,COMMA tissue  engineers  have  a  bit  of  an  identity  crisis  here ,COMMA because  structural  engineers  build  bridges  and  big  things ,COMMA computer  engineers ,COMMA computers ,COMMA but  what  we  are  doing  is  actually  building  enabling  technologies  for  the  cells  themselves .PERIOD what  does  this  mean  for  us ?QUESTIONMARK let  's  do  something  really  simple .PERIOD let  's  remind  ourselves  that  cells  are  not  an  abstract  concept .PERIOD let  's  remember  that  our  cells  sustain  our  lives  in  a  very  real  way .PERIOD we  are  what  we  eat ,COMMA could  easily  be  described  as ,COMMA we  are  what  our  cells  eat .PERIOD and  in  the  case  of  the  flora  in  our  gut ,COMMA these  cells  may  not  even  be  human .PERIOD but  it  's  also  worth  noting  that  cells  also  mediate  our  experience  of  life .PERIOD behind  every  sound ,COMMA sight ,COMMA touch ,COMMA taste  and  smell  is  a  corresponding  set  of  cells  that  receive  this  information  and  interpret  it  for  us .PERIOD it  begs  the  question ,COMMA shall  we  expand  our  sense  of  environmental  stewardship  to  include  the  ecosystem  of  our  own  bodies ?QUESTIONMARK i  invite  you  to  talk  about  this  with  me  further ,COMMA and  in  the  meantime ,COMMA i  wish  you  luck .PERIOD may  none  of  your  non-cancer  cells  become  endangered  species .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD
