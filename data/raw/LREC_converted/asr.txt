i  'm  as  a  font ,COMMA or  more  precisely ,COMMA a  high-functioning  autistic  savant .PERIOD it  's  a  rare  condition .PERIOD and  rarer  still  when  accompanied ,COMMA as  in  my  case ,COMMA by  self-awareness  and  a  mastery  of  language .PERIOD very  often  when  i  meet  someone  and  they've  learned  is  about  me ,COMMA there  's  a  certain  kind  of  awkwardness .PERIOD i  can  see  it  in  their  lives .PERIOD they  want  to  ask  me  something .PERIOD and  in  the  end ,COMMA quite  often ,COMMA the  urge  stronger  than  they  are  and  they  blurted  out ,COMMA if  i  give  you  my  date  of  birth ,COMMA can  it  's  an  order  of  the  week  i  was  born  on .PERIOD well  they  mention  cube  roots  all  asked  me  to  recite  a  long  number  or  long  text .PERIOD i  hope  you  'll  forgive  me ,COMMA if  i  do  n't  perform  a  kind  of  one-man  savant  show  for  you  today .PERIOD i  i  'm  going  to  talk  instead  about  something  far  more  interesting  than  these  of  first  full  cube  roots ,COMMA a  little  deeper  and  a  lot  closer ,COMMA to  my  mind ,COMMA and  work .PERIOD i  want  to  talk  to  you  briefly  about  perception .PERIOD when  he  was  my  team  that  plays  in  the  short  story  step  would  make  his  name ,COMMA anton  chekhov  kept  a  notebook  in  which  he  noted  down  his  observations  of  the  world  around  him ,COMMA little  details  that  other  people  seem  to  miss .PERIOD every  time  i  read  chekhov  and  his  unique  vision  of  human  life ,COMMA i  'm  reminded  of  why  i  too  became  a  light .PERIOD in  my  books ,COMMA i  explore  nature  of  perception  and  how  different  kinds  of  perceiving  create  different  kinds  of  knowing  and  understanding .PERIOD here  are  three  questions  drawn  from  my  work .PERIOD i  love  it  and  try  to  figure  them  out ,COMMA and  going  to  ask  you  to  consider  for  a  moment  the  intuitions  and  the  gut  instincts  they  're  going  through  your  head  and  your  heart  as  you  look  at  them .PERIOD for  example  the  calculation .PERIOD can  you  feel  well  and  the  number  line  the  solution  is  likely  to  fall ?QUESTIONMARK well  look  at  the  four  and  work  and  the  sounds .PERIOD can  you  get  a  sense  of  the  range  of  meanings  but  it  's  pointing  you  towards ?QUESTIONMARK and  in  terms  of  the  line  of  poetry ,COMMA why  does  the  poet  use  the  word  hare  laugh  and  in  love  it ?QUESTIONMARK i  'm  asking  you  to  do  this  because  i  believe  that  our  personal  perceptions ,COMMA you  see ,COMMA like  the  heart  of  how  we  acquire  knowledge .PERIOD aesthetic  judgments ,COMMA rather  than  abstract  reasoning ,COMMA guide  and  shape  the  process  by  which  we  all  come  to  know  what  we  know .PERIOD i  'm  an  extreme  example  of  this .PERIOD my  worlds  of  words  and  numbers  lair  with  color ,COMMA emotion  and  personality .PERIOD as  kwan  said ,COMMA it  's  a  condition  that  scientists  call  soonest  easier ,COMMA when  usual  course  talk  between  the  fences .PERIOD here  are  the  numbers  one  to  twelve  as  i  see  them ,COMMA every  number  with  its  own  shape  and  character .PERIOD one  is  a  flash  of  light  light .PERIOD six  is  a  tiny  and  very  sad  black  hole .PERIOD the  sketches  i  'm  black  and  white  it ,COMMA but  in  my  mind  they  have  come  to  this .PERIOD three  is  going .PERIOD four  is  blue .PERIOD five  is  yellow .PERIOD i  paint  as  well .PERIOD and  here  is  one  of  my  paintings .PERIOD it  's  a  multiplication  of  two  prime  numbers .PERIOD three-dimensional  shapes  and  the  space  they  create  in  the  middle  creates  a  new  shape ,COMMA the  answer  to  the  sum .PERIOD what  about  bigger  numbers .PERIOD well  you  cannot  get  much  bigger  than  empowering ,COMMA the  mathematical  constant .PERIOD it  's  an  infinite  number ,COMMA literally  goes  on  forever .PERIOD in  this  painting  but  i  made  of  the  first  twenty  decimals  of  pi ,COMMA i  take  the  covers  and  the  emotions  and  the  textures  and  i  paula  more  together  into  a  kind  of  rolling  numerical  landscape .PERIOD but  it  's  not  only  numbers  that  i  see  in  countries .PERIOD words  too ,COMMA for  me ,COMMA have  colors  and  emotions  and  textures .PERIOD and  this  is  an  opening  phrase  from  the  novel  lolita .PERIOD and  nabokov  was  himself  soon  is  static .PERIOD and  you  can  see  here  how  my  perception  of  the  sound  l  helps  the  alliteration  to  jump  right  out .PERIOD another  example ,COMMA a  little  bit  more  mathematical .PERIOD when  i  wonder  if  some  of  you  will  notice  the  construction  of  the  sentence  from  the  great  gatsby .PERIOD there  is  a  procession  of  syllables ,COMMA wheat ,COMMA one .PERIOD prairies ,COMMA two .PERIOD lost  swede  towns ,COMMA three ,COMMA one ,COMMA two ,COMMA three .PERIOD and  this  effect  is  very  pleasant  on  the  mind ,COMMA and  it  helps  the  sentence  to  feel  like  it .PERIOD let  's  go  back  to  the  questions  i  posed  your  moments  ago .PERIOD sixty  four  multiplied  by  seventy  five .PERIOD it  so  if  you  played  chess ,COMMA your  know  that  sixty  four  is  a  square  number ,COMMA and  that  's  why  just  forwards ,COMMA eight  by  eight ,COMMA have  sixty  four  squares .PERIOD so  that  gives  us  a  form  that  we  can  picture ,COMMA we  can  perceive .PERIOD about  seventy  five .PERIOD well  it  's  a  hundred ,COMMA we  think  of  a  hundred  as  of  being  a  like  a  square ,COMMA seventy  five  would  look  like  this .PERIOD so  what  we  need  to  do  now  is  put  those  two  pictures  together  in  our  mind ,COMMA something  like  this .PERIOD sixty  four  become  sixty  four  hundred .PERIOD and  in  the  light  hand  corner ,COMMA you  do  n't  have  to  calculate  anything .PERIOD full  across ,COMMA four  up  and  down ,COMMA at  sixteen .PERIOD so  what  the  sum  is  actually  asking  you  to  do  is  sixteen ,COMMA sixteen ,COMMA sixteen .PERIOD that  's  a  lot  easier  than  the  way  that  the  school  taught  you  to  do  math ,COMMA some  show .PERIOD it  's  sixteen ,COMMA sixteen ,COMMA sixteen ,COMMA forty  eight ,COMMA forty  eight  hundred ,COMMA four  thousand  eight  hundred ,COMMA the  answer  to  the  sum .PERIOD easy  when  you  know  how .PERIOD the  second  question  was  an  icelandic  word .PERIOD i  'm  assuming  are  not  many  people  here  who  speak  icelandic .PERIOD so  let  me  now  over  choices  down  to  two .PERIOD is  it  a  happy  word  was  sad  word ?QUESTIONMARK what  you  say ?QUESTIONMARK market .PERIOD some  people  say  it  's  happy .PERIOD most  people ,COMMA a  majority  of  people  say  sad .PERIOD and  it  actually  means  out .PERIOD why  do ,COMMA statistically ,COMMA a  majority  of  people  say  that  a  word  is  sad ,COMMA in  this  case ,COMMA heavy  in  other  cases ?QUESTIONMARK in  my  theory  language  evolves  in  such  a  way  that  sounds  match ,COMMA correspond  with  the  subjective ,COMMA with  the  personal  intuitive  experience  of  the  listener .PERIOD let  's  have  a  look  at  the  the  third  question .PERIOD it  's  a  line  from  a  poem  by  john  keeps .PERIOD words ,COMMA like  numbers ,COMMA express  fundamental  relationships  between  objects  and  events  and  forces  that  constitute  our  world .PERIOD it  stands  to  reason  that  we ,COMMA existing  in  this  well  it ,COMMA should  be  in  the  course  of  our  lives  absorb  intuitively  those  relationships .PERIOD some  poets ,COMMA like  other  artists ,COMMA play  with  those  intuitive  understandings .PERIOD in  the  case  of  hare ,COMMA it  's  an  ambiguous  sound  in  english .PERIOD you  can  also  mean  the  five  a  quote  from  ahead .PERIOD and  if  we  think  of  that ,COMMA we  put  the  picture  up ,COMMA the  five  was  represent  vulnerability .PERIOD there  you  would  to  the  slightest  movement  or  motion  or  emotion .PERIOD so  what  you  have  is  an  atmosphere  of  vulnerability  intention .PERIOD the  hare  itself  the  animal ,COMMA not  a  cat ,COMMA litter  dog ,COMMA hair ,COMMA why  hair ?QUESTIONMARK because  think  of  the  picture ,COMMA not  a  word ,COMMA the  picture .PERIOD the  overlong  ears ,COMMA the  over  large  feet ,COMMA helps  us  to  picture ,COMMA to  feel  intuitively ,COMMA what  it  means  to  limp  and  to  tremble .PERIOD so  in  these  few  minutes ,COMMA i  hope  i've  been  able  to  share  a  little  bit  of  my  vision  of  things ,COMMA and  to  show  you  that  words  can  have  colors  and  emotions ,COMMA numbers ,COMMA shapes  and  personalities .PERIOD the  world  is  richer ,COMMA vaster  than  it  too  often  seems  to  be .PERIOD i  hope  that  i've  given  you  desire  to  learn  to  see  the  world  with  new  eyes .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  play  artist  with  a  bit  of  an  unexpected  background .PERIOD i  was  in  my  twenties  before  i  ever  which  an  art  museum .PERIOD i  grew  up  in  the  middle  of  nowhere  on  a  dirt  road  in  rural  arkansas ,COMMA an  hour  from  the  nearest  movie  theater .PERIOD and  i  think  it  was  a  great  place  to  grow  up  as  an  artist ,COMMA because  i  grew  up  around  quirky ,COMMA colorful  characters  who  are  great  at  making  with  their  hands .PERIOD and  my  childhood  is  more  hick  than  i  could  ever  possibly  relate  to  you ,COMMA and  also  a  more  intellectual  than  you  would  ever  expect .PERIOD for  instance ,COMMA me  and  my  sister ,COMMA we  were  little ,COMMA we  would  compete  to  see  who  could  eat  the  most  squirrel  brains .PERIOD but  it  on  the  other  side  of  that  though ,COMMA we  are  we  are  big  readers  in  our  house .PERIOD and  if  the  tv  was  on  we  're  watching  a  documentary .PERIOD and  my  dad  is  the  most  voracious  reader  i  know .PERIOD you  can  read  a  novel  or  two  a  day .PERIOD but  when  i  was  little ,COMMA i  remember ,COMMA he  would  kill  flies  in  our  house  with  my  bb  gun .PERIOD and  what  was  so  amazing  to  me  about  that ,COMMA what  he  would  be  in  his  recliner ,COMMA would  holler  for  me  to  fetch  that  bb  gun ,COMMA and  i'd  go  get  it .PERIOD and  what  was  amazing  to  me ,COMMA was  a  bullet  was  pretty  kickass ,COMMA he  was  killing  a  fly  in  the  house  with  a  gun ,COMMA but  what  was  so  amazing  to  me  was  that  he  knew  just  enough  how  pump .PERIOD and  he  could  shoot  it  for  you  know  like  two  rooms  away  and  not  damage  what  was  on ,COMMA because  he  knew  how  to  pump  it  just  enough  to  kill  the  fly  and  not  damage  what  it  was  landed  on .PERIOD so  i  should  talk  about  or .PERIOD but  that  will  be  here  all  day  with  my  childhood  stories .PERIOD i  love  contemporary  art ,COMMA but  i  'm  also  doing  really  frustrated  with  the  contemporary  art  world  and  the  contemporary  art  scene .PERIOD a  few  years  ago ,COMMA i  spent  months  in  europe  to  see  the  major  international  art  exhibitions  that  no  have  the  pulse  of  what  is  supposed  to  be  going  on  in  the  art  world .PERIOD and  i  was  struck  by  going  to  so  many ,COMMA one  after  the  other ,COMMA kind  of  with  some  clarity  of  what  it  was  that  i  was  longing  for .PERIOD i  mean  i  'm  going  for  several  things  i  was  n't  getting ,COMMA or  not  getting  enough  love .PERIOD but  to  the  main  things ,COMMA one  of  that ,COMMA i  was  longing  for  more  work  that  was  appealing  to  a  broad  public ,COMMA that  was  accessible .PERIOD and  the  second  thing  that  i  was  going  for  was  more  exquisite  craftsmanship  and  technique .PERIOD so  i  i  started  thinking  and  listing  what  all  it  was  that  i  thought  would  make  a  perfect  biennial .PERIOD so  i  decided ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  start  my  own  biennial .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  organize  and  direct  it  and  get  it  going  in  the  world .PERIOD so  i  thought ,COMMA okay ,COMMA i  have  to  have  some  criteria  of  how  to  choose  work .PERIOD so  amongst  all  the  country  had ,COMMA this  kind  of  two  main  things .PERIOD one  of  them ,COMMA i  call  my  mama  's  test .PERIOD and  what  that  is  is  i  imagine  explaining  a  work  of  art  to  my  grandmother  in  five  minutes .PERIOD and  if  i  can  explain  it  five  minutes ,COMMA then  it  's  it  's  too  obtuse  or  are  as  a  trick  and  it  has  been  refined  enough  yet .PERIOD it  needs  to  be  worked  on  intelligence  speak  fluently .PERIOD and  then  my  other  second  set  of  rules ,COMMA i  hate  to  say  rules  because  it  's  are  caught ,COMMA my  criteria  would  be  the  three  ages ,COMMA which  is  a  head ,COMMA heart  and  hands .PERIOD and  great  art  would  have  hit ,COMMA it  would  have  interesting  intellectual  ideas  and  concepts .PERIOD it  would  have  heart  in  that  it  would  have  passionate  heart  and  soul .PERIOD and  it  would  have  hand  in  that  it  would  be  greatly  crafted .PERIOD so  i  started  thinking  about  poker  hand  this  biennial ,COMMA how  i  'm  going  to  show  how  my  going  to  travel  the  world  and  find  these  artists .PERIOD and  then  i  realized  one  day ,COMMA that  there  's  an  easier  solution  to  this .PERIOD i  'm  just  going  to  make  the  whole  thing  myself .PERIOD and  so  this  is  what  i  did .PERIOD i  i  i  thought ,COMMA okay  biennial  needs  artists .PERIOD number  did  in  international  biennial ,COMMA i  need  artists  from  all  around  the  world .PERIOD so  what  i  did  was  i  invented  a  hundred  artists  from  around  the  world .PERIOD i  figured  out  their  bios ,COMMA their  passions  in  life  and  their  art  styles ,COMMA and  i  started  making  their  work .PERIOD and  so  i  thought  well ,COMMA this  is  kind  of  project  that  i  did  my  whole  life  doing .PERIOD so  i  decided ,COMMA i  'm  going  to  make  this  a  real  biennial .PERIOD it  's  only  two  years  of  studio  work .PERIOD and  i  'm  going  to  create  this  in  two  years .PERIOD in  i  have .PERIOD so  i  i  should  i  should  start  to  talk  about  these  guys .PERIOD well  the  range  is  it  's  quite  a  bit .PERIOD and  i  'm  such  a  technician ,COMMA so  i  love  this  project ,COMMA getting  to  play  with  all  the  techniques .PERIOD so  for  example ,COMMA in  realist  paintings ,COMMA ranges  from  like  this ,COMMA which  is  kind  of  old  masters  style ,COMMA to  really  realistic  still-life ,COMMA to  this  type  of  painting  where  i  'm  painting  with  a  single  hair .PERIOD and  then  at  the  other  end ,COMMA there  's  performance  and  short  sounds  and  endorsed  installations  like  this  indoor  installations  and  this  one ,COMMA and  other  installations  like  this  one  and  this  one .PERIOD a  nice  image ,COMMA i  'm  making  all  these  things .PERIOD this  is  is  n't  publish  opt .PERIOD i  'm  like  under  the  river  with  those  fish .PERIOD so  now  let  me  introduce  some  of  my  fictional  artists  do  you .PERIOD this  is  now  reynolds .PERIOD now  i  was  interested  in  agricultural  processes ,COMMA and  her  work  is  based  in  these  practices .PERIOD this  piece ,COMMA which  is  called  flipped  earth ,COMMA she  was  interested  in  taking  the  sky  and  using  it  to  cleanse  barren  ground .PERIOD and  by  taking  giant  mirrors ,COMMA in  here  she  's  taking  giant  mirrors  and  then  pulling  them  into  the  dirt .PERIOD and  the  great  this  is  twenty  two  feet  long .PERIOD what  i  loved  about  her  work  is ,COMMA when  i  walk  around  it  in  and  look  and  look  down  into  the  sky ,COMMA you  know  looking  down  to  watch  the  sky ,COMMA and  it  folded  in  a  new  way .PERIOD and  probably  the  best  part  of  this  piece  is  at  dusk  and  dawn  when  mike  that  the  twilight  which  is  falling  on  the  ground  stark ,COMMA but  this  the  light  above  bright  above .PERIOD and  so  you  're  standing  there  anything  else  to  start ,COMMA that  there  's  this  portal  that  you  want  to  jump  in .PERIOD and  this  piece  was  great .PERIOD this  is  in  my  parents  backyard  in  arkansas .PERIOD and  i  love  to  dig  a  hole .PERIOD so  this  piece  was  great  fine ,COMMA has  it  was  two  days  of  digging  and  softer .PERIOD the  next  artist  is  scale  over  three ,COMMA and  she  's  interested  enough  to  morality  and  transience .PERIOD and  in  her  most  recent  project ,COMMA it  's  called  weather  i  made .PERIOD and  she  's  making  weather  on  her  body  's  scale .PERIOD and  this  piece  is  prof .PERIOD in  what  she  did  was  human  and  on  a  cold ,COMMA dry  night  in  breed  back  and  forth  on  the  long  island  to  leave ,COMMA to  leave  her  life  's  mark ,COMMA the  marker  of  progress .PERIOD and  so  this  is  five  foot ,COMMA five  inches  of  frost  that  she  left  behind .PERIOD the  sun  rises ,COMMA and  it  melts  away .PERIOD and  that  that  was  played  by  my  mum .PERIOD so  the  next  artist ,COMMA this  is  a  group  of  japanese  artists ,COMMA a  collective  of  japanese  artists ,COMMA in  their  own  and  in  tokyo .PERIOD and  they  were  interested  in  developing  a  new ,COMMA alternative  art  space .PERIOD and  they  needed  funding  for  it ,COMMA so  they  decided  to  come  up  with  some  interesting  fundraising  projects .PERIOD one  of  these  is  scratch-off  masterpieces .PERIOD and  so  so  what  they  're  doing ,COMMA each  of  these  artists  on  a  nine  by  seven  inch  card ,COMMA which  they  sell  for  ten  bucks ,COMMA they  drew  original  works  of  art .PERIOD and  you  buy  one ,COMMA and  maybe  you  get  a  real  peace  and  maybe  not .PERIOD well  this  is  part  of  this  has  sparked  a  craze  in  japan ,COMMA because  everyone  's  wanting  a  masterpiece .PERIOD and  the  ones  that  are  most  sought  after  on  winter  only  barely  scratched  off .PERIOD and  all  these  works ,COMMA in  some  ways ,COMMA talk  about  luck  or  fate  or  chance .PERIOD those  first  two  are  tortured  to  make  a  jackpot  winners  years  before  and  after  their  win .PERIOD and  in  this  one  it  's  called  a  drawing  the  short  stick .PERIOD i  love  this  piece  because  i  have  a  little  cousin  at  home  we  introduced  me ,COMMA which  i  think  it  's  such  a  great  introduction ,COMMA to  friend  one  day  as ,COMMA this  is  my  cousin  j .PERIOD he  draws  sticks  real  the .PERIOD which  is  one  of  the  best  coverage  ever .PERIOD this  artist  as  gusts  wind  miller ,COMMA and  he  's  doing  a  project ,COMMA large  project ,COMMA called  art  for  the  peoples .PERIOD and  within  this  project ,COMMA is  doing  a  smaller  project  called  artists  in  residence .PERIOD and  what  he  does  is ,COMMA he  spends  a  week  at  a  time  with  the  family .PERIOD any  these  shows  up  on  the  shows  up  on  their  porch ,COMMA their  doorstep ,COMMA with  was  a  toothbrush  and  pajamas ,COMMA and  he  's  ready  to  spend  a  week  with  them .PERIOD and  using  only  what  's  present ,COMMA he  goes  in  and  makes  a  little  abode  studio  to  work  out  of .PERIOD on  an  expense  that  week  talking  to  the  family  about  what  they  think  great  art  is .PERIOD yes  all  these  discussions  with  their  family .PERIOD any  digs  through  everything  they  have ,COMMA and  he  finds  materials  to  make  war .PERIOD and  he  makes  a  work  that  answers  what  they  think  great  art  is .PERIOD for  this  family ,COMMA he  made  this  still-life  painting .PERIOD and  whatever  he  makes  somehow  references  nesting  in  and  space  and  personal  property .PERIOD this  next  project ,COMMA is  this  is  by  a  walking  parents  they  go ,COMMA and  he  's  interested  in ,COMMA people  believes  that  art  is  everywhere  waiting ,COMMA that  it  just  needs  a  little  bit  of  a  push  to  happen .PERIOD and  he  provides  this  push  by  harnessing  natural  forces ,COMMA like  in  this  series  we  used  rain  to  make  paintings .PERIOD this  project  is  called  love  nests .PERIOD what  he  did  was  to  get  wild  birds  to  make  is  are  born .PERIOD so  he  put  the  material  in  places  where  the  birds  were  in  the  collective  men ,COMMA they  crafted  his  nests  form .PERIOD and  this  one  's  called  love  locksmiths .PERIOD this  one  's  called  mixtape  love  song  nest .PERIOD and  this  one  's  called  lovemaking  nest .PERIOD next  is  a  belief  later .PERIOD sylvia  's  interested  in  art  training .PERIOD she  's  very  serious  swiss  artist .PERIOD and  she  was  thinking  about  her  friends  and  family  who  are  working  in  my  car  sweden  places  in  developing  countries ,COMMA and  she  was  thinking ,COMMA what  can  i  make  that  would  be  of  value  to  them ,COMMA in  case  you  know  something  bad  happens  and  they  have  to  buy  their  way  across  the  border  or  pay  off  a  gunman .PERIOD and  so  she  came  up  with  creating  these  pocket-sized  artworks  that  are  portraits  of  the  person  that  would  carry  them .PERIOD and  you  would  carry  this  around  with  you ,COMMA and  if  everything  with  the  health ,COMMA and  you  could  make  payments  and  by  your  life .PERIOD so  this  life  price  is  for  an  irrigation  non-profit  director .PERIOD so  hopefully  what  happens  is  you  never  use  it ,COMMA and  it  's  it  's  an  airline  they  passed  down .PERIOD and  she  makes  them  so  they  could  either  be  broken  up  into  payments ,COMMA or  they  could  be  like  these  which  are  leaves  that  can  be  payments .PERIOD until  they  're  valuable .PERIOD this  is  precious  metals  and  gemstones .PERIOD and  this  one  had  to  get  broken  up .PERIOD he  had  to  break  off  a  piece  to  get  out  of  egypt  recently .PERIOD this  is  my  duo ,COMMA michael  abernathy  and  bud  holland .PERIOD and  they  're  interested  in  creating  culture ,COMMA just  tradition .PERIOD so  what  they  do  is  they  move  into  an  area  and  try  to  establish  a  new  tradition  and  a  small  geographic  area .PERIOD so  this  is  in  eastern  tennessee ,COMMA and  what  they  decided  was  that  you  know  we  need  a  positive  tradition  that  goes  with  death .PERIOD so  they  came  up  with  big  gigs .PERIOD and  it  did  did ,COMMA i  did  you  is  where ,COMMA for  a  milestone  anniversary  or  birthday ,COMMA you  are  and  you  get  all  your  friends  and  family  together  and  you  dance  on  where  you  're  going  to  be  buried .PERIOD and  we  we  got  a  lot  of  it  is  a  millimeter  thick  is  this .PERIOD i  talked  my  family  into  doing  this ,COMMA all  that  and  what  i  was  doing .PERIOD like  dress  if  you  know ,COMMA we  're  going  to  go  do  some  work .PERIOD and  so  we  got  to  the  graveyard  and  made  this ,COMMA which  was  whole  areas  of ,COMMA the  attention  that  we  got .PERIOD so  what  happens  is  you  dance  on  the  grave .PERIOD and  then  after  you've  done  your  dance ,COMMA everyone  toast  you  and  tells  you  how  great  you  are .PERIOD new  beans  essence  have  a  funeral  they  to  be  present  for .PERIOD that  's  my  mum  and  dad .PERIOD this  is  my  jason  birdsong .PERIOD he  is  interested  in  how  we  see  as  an  animal ,COMMA how  we  are  interested  in  mimicry  and  camouflage .PERIOD you  know  we  look  down  a  dark  alley  or  jungle  path ,COMMA trying  to  make  out  a  face  or  a  preacher .PERIOD we  said  that  natural  way  of  seeing .PERIOD and  he  plays  with  this  idea .PERIOD and  and  this  piece ,COMMA schools  on  actually  leave .PERIOD there  are  butterfly  specimens  have  a  natural  camouflage .PERIOD so  he  pairs  these  up .PERIOD here  's  another .PERIOD solar  actually  all  real  brick  a  butterfly  specimens .PERIOD and  he  pairs  these  out  with  paintings .PERIOD like  this  is  a  painting  of  a  stake  in  a  box .PERIOD so  you  you  open  the  box  and  you  think ,COMMA well ,COMMA there  's  a  there  's  a  snake  in  there .PERIOD but  it  's  actually  a  painting .PERIOD so  he  makes  these  interesting  conversations  about  realism  in  mimicry  in  our  drive  to  be  fooled  by  great  camouflage .PERIOD the  next  artist  is  hazel  clausen .PERIOD it

the  driveway .PERIOD and  it  i  decided  about  that  time ,COMMA about  age  ten ,COMMA that  would  be  really  cool  if  i  was  a  test  driver .PERIOD so  i  counted  go  to  dinner .PERIOD they'd  sit  down ,COMMA i'd  sneak  out  of  the  house .PERIOD i  jump  behind  the  wheel  and  take  the  new  model  around  the  driveway ,COMMA and  was  a  blast .PERIOD the  net  went  on  for  about  two  years ,COMMA until ,COMMA i  think  there  's  about  twelve ,COMMA my  dad  brought  home  a  a  lincoln  mark  three .PERIOD and  it  was  snowing  that  day .PERIOD so  in  went  to  dinner .PERIOD and  i  stuck  out  and  not  be  really  cool  to  do  doughnuts  and  maybe  even  some  figure  eights  in  the  snow .PERIOD my  dad  finished  in  early  that  evening .PERIOD

but  my  great  grandfather ,COMMA henry  ford ,COMMA really  believe  that  the  mission  of  the  ford  motor  company  was  to  make  people  's  lives  better  and  make  cars  affordable  so  that  everyone  could  happen .PERIOD because  he  believed  that ,COMMA with  mobility ,COMMA comes  freedom  and  progress .PERIOD and  that  's  a  belief  that  i  share .PERIOD well  the  great  passion  is  the  environment .PERIOD and  as  young  boy ,COMMA i  used  to  go  up  to  northern  michigan  and  fish  in  the  rivers  that  hemingway  fished  in  and  then  later  wrote  about .PERIOD and  it  really  struck  me  in  as  the  years  went  by ,COMMA in  a  in  a  very  negative  way ,COMMA when  i  would  go  to  some  stream  that  i'd  loved ,COMMA and  was  used  to  walk  into  this  field  that  was  once  filled  with  fireflies ,COMMA and  now  head  strip  mall  or  about  condos  on  it .PERIOD and  so  even  at  a  young  age ,COMMA that  really  resonated  with  me .PERIOD and  and  the  whole  notion  of  environmental  preservation ,COMMA at  a  very  basic  level ,COMMA sunk  in  with  me .PERIOD as  a  high  school ,COMMA i  started  to  read  authors

that  my  love  of  cars  and  in  trucks  would  ever  be  in  conflict  with  nature .PERIOD and  that  was  true  until  i  got  to  college .PERIOD and  what  i  got  to  college ,COMMA you  can  imagine  my  surprise  when  i  would  go  to  class  and  a  number  of  my  professors  would  say  that  ford  motor  company  and  my  family  was  kind  of  everything  that  was  wrong  with  a  lot  of  our  country .PERIOD they  thought  that  we  were  more  interested ,COMMA as  an  industry ,COMMA in  profits ,COMMA rather  than  progress ,COMMA and  that  we  filled  the  skies  with  smog ,COMMA and  frankly ,COMMA we  were  the  enemy .PERIOD i  joined  ford  after  college ,COMMA after  some  soul-searching  whether  not  this  is  really  the  right  thing  to  do .PERIOD but  i  decided  that  i  wanted  to  go  and  see  if  i  could  affect  change  there .PERIOD and  as  i  look  back  over  thirty  years  ago ,COMMA i  was  a  little  naive  to  think  at  that  age  that  i  could ,COMMA but  i  wanted  to .PERIOD i  really  discovered  that  my  professors  were  completely  wrong .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA when  i  got  back  to  detroit ,COMMA my  environmental  leanings  one  exactly  embraced  by  those  in  my  own  company ,COMMA and  certainly  by  those  in  the  industry .PERIOD i  it  's  very  interesting  conversations ,COMMA are  is  you  can  imagine .PERIOD there  were  some  are  within  ford  who  believed  that  all  this  ecological  nonsense  should  just  disappear  and  that  i  needed  to  stop  hanging  out  with  quote  environmental  wackos .PERIOD i  was  considered  a  radical .PERIOD i  'll  never  forget  the  day  i  was  called  in  by  a  member  of  top  management  and  told  to  stop  associating  with  any  known  or  suspected  environmentalists .PERIOD chris  i  had  no  intention  of  of  doing  that .PERIOD and  i  kept  speaking  out  about  the  environment .PERIOD and  it  really  was  the  topic  that  we  now  today  call  sustainability .PERIOD and  in  time ,COMMA my  views  went  from  controversy  o  two  more  less  consensus  today .PERIOD i  mean ,COMMA i  think  most  people  in  the  industry  understand  that  we've  got  to  get  on  with  it .PERIOD and  the  good  news  is  today  we  are  tackling  the  big  issues ,COMMA of  of  cars  and  the  environment ,COMMA not  only  for ,COMMA the  really  as  an  industry .PERIOD we  're  pushing  fuel  efficiency  to  new  heights .PERIOD there  was  no  technology ,COMMA we  're  reducing ,COMMA and  i  believe ,COMMA someday  we  'll  eliminate ,COMMA co  two  emissions .PERIOD we  're  starting  to  sell  electric  cars ,COMMA which  is  great .PERIOD we  're  developing  alternative  powertrains  that  are  going  to  make  the  our  cars  affordable  in  every  sense  of  the  word ,COMMA economically ,COMMA socially  and  environmentally .PERIOD and  actually ,COMMA although  we've  got  a  long  way  to  go  and  a  lot  of  work  to  do ,COMMA i  can  see  the  day  when  my  two  great  passions ,COMMA cars  and  the  environment ,COMMA actually  come  into  harmony .PERIOD but  unfortunately ,COMMA as  were  our  way  to  solving  one  monstrous  problem ,COMMA and  as  i  said ,COMMA we  're  not  there  yet .PERIOD we've  got  a  lot  of  work  to  do ,COMMA but  i  can  see  where  we  will ,COMMA but  it  even  as  we  're  in  the  process  of  doing  that ,COMMA another  huge  problem  is  looming ,COMMA and  people  are  noticing .PERIOD and  that  is  the  freedom  of  mobility  that  my  great  grandfather  brought  to  people  is  now  being  threatened  just  as  the  environment  is .PERIOD the  problem ,COMMA put  in  its  simplest  terms ,COMMA is  one  of  mathematics .PERIOD today  there  are  approximately  six  point  eight  billion  people  in  the  world .PERIOD and  within  our  lifetime ,COMMA that  number  's  going  to  grow  to  about  nine  billion .PERIOD in  it  that  population  level ,COMMA our  planet  will  be  dealing  with  the  limits  of  growth .PERIOD and  with  that  growth  comes  some  severe  practical  problems ,COMMA one  of  which  is  our  transportation  system  simply  wo  n't  be  able  to  deal  with  that .PERIOD when  we  look  at  the  population  growth  in  terms  of  cars ,COMMA it  becomes  even  clearer .PERIOD today  there  are  about  eight  hundred  million  cars  on  the  road  worldwide .PERIOD and  but  with  more  people  and  greater  prosperity  around  the  world ,COMMA that  number  's  going  to  grow  to  between  two  and  four  billion  cars  by  mid-century .PERIOD and  this  is  going  to  create  the  kind  of  global  gridlock  that  the  world  is  never  seen  before .PERIOD let  's  think  about  the  impact  that  this  is  going  to  have  our  daily  lives .PERIOD today  the  average  american  spends  about  a  week  a  year  stuck  in  traffic  jams .PERIOD and  that  's  a  huge  waste  of  time  and  resources .PERIOD but  that  's  nothing  compared  to  what  's  going  on  in  the  nations  that  are  growing  the  fastest .PERIOD today  the  average  driver  in  beijing  has  a  five  hour  commute .PERIOD and  last  summer ,COMMA many  of  you  probably  saw  this ,COMMA there  was  a  hundred  mile  traffic  jam  that  took  eleven  days  to  clear  in  china .PERIOD in  the  decades  to  come ,COMMA seventy  five  percent  of  the  world  's  population  will  live  in  cities ,COMMA and  fifty  of  those  cities  will  be  of  ten  million  people  or  more .PERIOD so  you  can  see  the  size  of  the  issue  that  we  're  facing .PERIOD when  you  factor  in  population  growth ,COMMA it  's  clear  that  the  mobility  model  that  we  have  today  simply  will  not  work  tomorrow .PERIOD frankly ,COMMA four  billion  clean  cars  on  the  road  are  still  four  billion  cars .PERIOD and  a  traffic  jam  with  no  emissions  is  still  a  traffic  jam .PERIOD so  health ,COMMA if  we  make  no  changes  today ,COMMA what  tomorrow  look  like ?QUESTIONMARK like  think  you  probably  already  have  the  picture .PERIOD traffic  jams  are  just  a  symptom  of  this  challenge ,COMMA and  they  're  really  very ,COMMA very  inconvenient ,COMMA but  that  's  kind  of  all  they  are .PERIOD but  the  bigger  issue  is  that  global  gridlock  is  going  to  stifle  economic  growth  and  our  ability  to  deliver  food  and  health  care ,COMMA particularly  to  people  that  live  in  city  centres .PERIOD and  our  quality  of  life  is  going  to  be  severely  compromised .PERIOD so  what  's  going  to  solve  this ?QUESTIONMARK well  the  answer  is  n't  going  to  be  more  of  the  same .PERIOD my  great  grandfather  once  said  before  he  invented  the  model  t ,COMMA if  i  ask  people  than  what  they  wanted ,COMMA they  would  have  answered ,COMMA we  want  faster  forces .PERIOD so  the  answer  to  more  cars  is  simply  not  to  have  more  roads .PERIOD what  america  began  moving  west ,COMMA we  can  add  more  wagon  trains ,COMMA we  built  railroads .PERIOD and  to  connect  our  country  after  world  war  two ,COMMA we  did  n't  build  more  two-lane  highways ,COMMA we  built  the  interstate  highway  system .PERIOD today  we  need  that  same  leap  and  thinking  for  us  to  create  a  viable  future .PERIOD we  are  going  to  build  smart  cars ,COMMA but  we  also  need  to  build  smart  roads ,COMMA smart  parking ,COMMA smart  public  transportation  systems  and  more .PERIOD we  do  n't  want  to  waste  their  time  sitting  in  traffic ,COMMA sitting  at  all  those  or  looking  for  parking  spots .PERIOD we  need  an  integrated  system  that  uses  real-time  data  to  optimize  personal  mobility  on  a  massive  scale  without  hassle  or  compromises  for  travelers .PERIOD if  i  could  have  the  kind  of  system  that  's  going  to  make  the  future  of  of  personal  mobility  sustainable .PERIOD now  the  good  news  is  some  of  this  work  is  already  begun  in  different  parts  of  the  world .PERIOD the  city  of  mass  star  in  upper  darby  uses  driverless  electric  vehicles  that  can  communicate  with  one  another ,COMMA and  they  go  underneath  the  city  streets .PERIOD up  above ,COMMA you've  got  a  series  of  pedestrian  walkways .PERIOD a  new  york  city  's  thirty  four  street ,COMMA gridlock  will  soon  be  replaced  with  a  connected  system  of  vehicle  specific  orders .PERIOD pedestrian  zones  in  dedicated  traffic  lanes  are  going  to  be  created ,COMMA and  all  of  this  will  look  cut  down  the  average  rush  hour  commute  to  get  across  town  in  new  york  from  about  an  hour  today  at  rush  hour  to  about  twenty  minutes .PERIOD now  if  you  look  at  hong  kong ,COMMA they  have  a  very  interesting  system  paul  arctic  was  there .PERIOD it  's  a  system  that  really  ties  together  all  the  transportation  assets  into  a  single  payment  system .PERIOD so  parking  garages ,COMMA buses ,COMMA trains ,COMMA they  all  operate  within  the  same  system .PERIOD now  shared  power  services  are  also  springing  up  around  the  world .PERIOD and  these  efforts ,COMMA i  think  are  great .PERIOD the  relieving  congestion ,COMMA and  they  're  frankly  starting  to  save  some  fuel .PERIOD these  are  all  really  good  ideas  that  will  move  us  forward .PERIOD but  what  really  inspires  me  is  what  's  really  possible  what  our  cars  can  begin  talking  to  each  other .PERIOD very  soon ,COMMA the  same  system  that  we  use  today  to  bring  music  and  in  entertainment  and  gps  information  into  our  vehicles  are  going  to  be  used  to  create  a  smart  vehicle  network .PERIOD every  morning  i  drive  about  thirty  miles  from  my  home  in  ann  arbor  to  my  office  and  you  're  one ,COMMA michigan .PERIOD and  every  night  i  go  home ,COMMA my  commute  is  a  total  crapshoot .PERIOD and  i  often  have  to  leave  the  freeway  and  look  for  different  ways  for  me  to  try  and  make  it  home .PERIOD but  very  soon  we  're  going  to  see  the  days  when  cars  are  essentially  talking  to  each  other .PERIOD so  if  the  car  ahead  of  me  and  i  ninety  four  hits  traffic ,COMMA it  will  immediately  alert  my  car  and  tell  my  car  to  reroute  itself  to  get  me  home  in  the  best  possible  way .PERIOD and  these  systems  are  being  tested  right  now ,COMMA and  frankly  they  're  going  to  be  ready  for  prime  time  pretty  soon .PERIOD but  the  potential  of  a  connected  car  network  is  almost  live  limitless .PERIOD one  day  very  soon ,COMMA you  'll  be  able  to  plan  a  trip  downtown  in  your  car  will  be  connected  to  a  smart  parking  system .PERIOD so  you  get  your  car ,COMMA and  as  you  get  in  your  car ,COMMA your  car  will  reserve  you  parking  spot  before  you  arrive ,COMMA no  more  driving  around  looking  for  one ,COMMA which  frankly  is  one  of  the  biggest  users  of  fuel  in  today  's  cars  and  in  urban  areas  is  looking  for  parking  spots .PERIOD or  think  about  being  in  new  york  city  and  tracking  down  an  intelligent  cab  on  your  smartphone  so  you  do  n't  have  to  wait  and  the  cold  to  hail  one .PERIOD or  being  in  the  future  ted  conference  and  having  your  car  talk  to  the  calendars  of  everybody  here  and  telling  you  all  the  best  route  to  take  home  and  when  you  should  leave ,COMMA so  the  goal  arriving  here  next  destination  on  time .PERIOD this  is  the  kind  of  technology  that  will  merge  millions  of  individual  vehicles  into  a  single  system .PERIOD so  i  think  it  's  clear  we  have  the  beginnings  of  a  solution  to  this  enormous  problem .PERIOD but  as  we  found  out  with  addressing  co  two  issues ,COMMA and  also  fossil  fuels ,COMMA there  is  no  one  silver  bullet .PERIOD the  solution  is  not  going  to  be  more  cars ,COMMA more  roads  or  new  rail  system .PERIOD it  can  only  be  found ,COMMA i  believe ,COMMA in  a  global  network  of  interconnected  solutions .PERIOD now  i  know  we  can  develop  the  technology  that  's  going  to  make  this  work ,COMMA we  gotta  be  willing  to  get  out  there  and  seek  out  the  solutions ,COMMA whether  that  means  vehicle  sharing  or  public  transportation  or  some  other  way  we  have  n't  even  thought  of  yet ,COMMA our  overall  transportation  mix  an  infrastructure  must  support  all  the  future  options .PERIOD we  need  our  best  and  our  brightest  to  start  entertaining  this  issue .PERIOD companies ,COMMA entrepreneurs ,COMMA venture  capitalists ,COMMA they  all  need  to  understand  this  is  a  huge  business  opportunity ,COMMA is  well  as  an  enormous  social  problem .PERIOD and  just  as  these  groups  embrace  the  green  energy  challenge ,COMMA and  i  was  really  been  amazing  to  me  to  watch  how  much  brain  power ,COMMA how  much  money  and  how  much  serious  thought  is  n't ,COMMA it  over  the  last  three ,COMMA really  three  years  is  poured  into  the  green  energy  field .PERIOD we  need  that  same  kind  of  passion  and  energy  to  attack  global  gridlock .PERIOD we  need  people  like  all  of  you  in  this  room ,COMMA leading  thinkers .PERIOD and  frankly  i  really  need  all  of  you  to  think  about  how  you  can  help  solve  this  this  huge  issue .PERIOD and  we  need  people  from  all  walks  of  life .PERIOD not  just  inventors ,COMMA we  need  policymakers  in  government  officials  to  also  think  about  how  they  're  going  to  respond  to  this  challenge .PERIOD this  is  going  to  be  solved  by  any  one  person  or  one  group .PERIOD it  's  going  to  really  require  a  national  energy  policy  of  frankly  for  each  country ,COMMA because  the  solutions  in  each  country  are  going  to  be  different  based  upon  income  levels ,COMMA traffic  jams  and  also  how  integrated  the  the  systems  already  are .PERIOD but  we  need  to  get  going ,COMMA and  we  need  to  get  going  today .PERIOD and  we  must  have  an  infrastructure  that  's  designed  to  support  this  flexible  future .PERIOD you  know ,COMMA we've  come  a  long  way .PERIOD since  the  model  t ,COMMA most  people  never  traveled  more  than  twenty  five  miles  from  home  and  their  entire  lifetime .PERIOD and  since  then ,COMMA but  the  automobile  has  allowed  us  the  freedom  to  choose  where  we  live ,COMMA where  we  work ,COMMA where  we  play  and  frankly  when  we  just  go  out  and  want  to  move  around .PERIOD we  do  n't  want  to  regress  we  lose  that  freedom .PERIOD we  're  on  our  way  to  solving ,COMMA and  as  i  said  earlier ,COMMA i  know  that  a  long  way  to  go ,COMMA the  one  big  issue  that  we  're  all  focused  on  that  threatens  it ,COMMA and  that  's  the  environmental  issue ,COMMA but  i  believe  we  all  must  turn  all  over  africa  and  all  over  ingenuity  and  determination  to  help  now  solve  this  notion  of  global  gridlock .PERIOD because  in  doing  so ,COMMA we  're  going  to  preserve  what  we've  really  come  to  take  for  granted ,COMMA which  is  the  freedom  to  move  and  move  very  effortlessly  around  the  world .PERIOD and  and  and  frankly  will  enhance  our  quality  of  life  if  we  fix  this .PERIOD because ,COMMA if  you  can  envision ,COMMA as  i  do ,COMMA a  future  of  zero  emissions  in  freedom  to  move  around  the  country  and  around  the  world  like  we  take  for  granted  today ,COMMA that  's  worth  of  hard  work  today  to  preserve  that  for  tomorrow .PERIOD i  believe  we  're  at  our  best  when  we  're  confronted  with  the  issues .PERIOD this  is  a  big  one  and  it  wo  n't  wait .PERIOD so  let  's  get  started  now .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD the  high  line  is  an  old ,COMMA elevated  rail  line  that  runs  for  a  mile  and  a  half  right  through  manhattan .PERIOD and  it  was  originally  a  freight  line  that  ran  down  ten  thousand .PERIOD and  it  became  known  as  death  avenue  because  so  many  people  were  run  over  by  the  trains  that  the  railroad  hired  a  guy  in  first  back  to  run  in  front ,COMMA and  he  became  known  as  the  west  side  cowboy .PERIOD but  even  with  a  cowboy ,COMMA about  one  person  in  a  month  was  killed  and  run  over .PERIOD so  the  elevated  it .PERIOD they  built  a  thirty  feet ,COMMA in  the  air  right  through  the  middle  of  the  city .PERIOD but  with  the  rise  of  interstate  trucking ,COMMA it  was  used  a  less  and  less .PERIOD and  by  nineteen  eighty  the  last  train  rode .PERIOD it  was  a  train  motor  frozen  turkeys ,COMMA they  say ,COMMA at  thanksgiving ,COMMA from  the  meatpacking  district .PERIOD and  that  it  was  abandoned .PERIOD and  i  live  in  the  neighborhood ,COMMA and  i  first  read  about  it  in  the  new  york  times ,COMMA in  articles  that  it  said  it  was  going  to  be  demolished .PERIOD and  i  assume  someone  was  working  to  preserve  it  or  save  it  i  volunteer ,COMMA but  i  realized  no  one  was  doing  anything .PERIOD i  would  my  first  community  board  meeting ,COMMA which  i'd  never  been  to  one  before ,COMMA and  sat  next  to  another  guy  named  joshua  david ,COMMA was  a  travel  writer .PERIOD and  at  the  end  of  the  meeting ,COMMA we  realize  we  're  the  only  two  people  there  were  so  interest  in  the  project .PERIOD was  people  wanted  to  tear  it  down .PERIOD so  we  exchanged  business  cards ,COMMA and  we  kept  calling  each  other  and  decided  to  start  this  organisation ,COMMA friends  of  the  high  line .PERIOD and  the  goal  at  first  was  just  saving  it  from  demolition ,COMMA but  then  we  also  wanted  to  figure  out  what  we  could  do  with  it .PERIOD and  what  first  attracted  me ,COMMA are  interested  me ,COMMA with  this  this  view  from  the  street ,COMMA which  is  this  you  know  steel  structure ,COMMA was  a  rusty ,COMMA this  industrial  relic .PERIOD but  when  i  went  up  on  top ,COMMA it  was  a  mile  and  a  half  of  wildflowers  running  right  through  the  middle  of  manhattan  you  know  with  views  of  the  empire  state  building  and  the  statue  of  liberty  and  had  some  river .PERIOD and  that  's  really  where  we  started ,COMMA the  idea  of  coalesced  around ,COMMA let  's  make  this  a  park ,COMMA and  let  's  have  it  be  sort  of  inspired  by  this  a  wild  skate .PERIOD at  the  time ,COMMA there  was  a  lot  of  opposition .PERIOD mayor  giuliani  wanted  to  tear  it  down .PERIOD i  'm  a  fast  forward  to  a  lot  of  lawsuits  and  a  lot  of  sort  of  community  engagement .PERIOD mayor  bloomberg  came  in  office ,COMMA he  was  very  supportive ,COMMA but  we  still  have  to  make  the  economic  case .PERIOD this  was  after  nine  allowed  in .PERIOD the  city  was  in  tough  times .PERIOD so  we  commissioned  an  economic  feasibility  study  to  try  to  make  the  case .PERIOD and  it  turns  out ,COMMA we  got  those  numbers  wrong .PERIOD we  said  it  would  cost  a  hundred  million  dollars  to  build .PERIOD so  far  it  's  cost  about  a  hundred  and  fifty  million .PERIOD and  the  the  main  case  was ,COMMA this  is  going  to  make  good  economic  sense  for  the  city .PERIOD so  we  said  over  twenty  year  time  period ,COMMA the  value  to  the  city  and  increased  property  values  and  increased  taxes  would  be  about  two  hundred  fifty  million .PERIOD that  was  enough .PERIOD it  really  got  the  city  behind  it .PERIOD it  turns  out  we  were  wrong  on  that .PERIOD now  people  estimate  it  's  created  about  has  a  billion  dollars ,COMMA and  will  create  about  half  a  billion  dollars ,COMMA in  tax  revenues  for  the  city .PERIOD we  did  a  design  competition ,COMMA selected  the  design  team .PERIOD we  worked  with  them  to  really  create  a  design  that  was  inspired  by  that  sort  of  wild  skate .PERIOD there  's  three  sections .PERIOD we  open  the  first  section  in  two  thousand  nine .PERIOD it  's  been  so  successful  beyond  our  dreams .PERIOD last  year  we  had  about  two  million  people ,COMMA which  is  about  ten  times  what  we  ever  estimated .PERIOD this  is  one  of  my  favorite  features  in  section  one .PERIOD it  's  this  amphitheater  right  over  ten  thousand .PERIOD on  the  first  section  in  the  twentieth  street  right  now .PERIOD the  other  thing ,COMMA it  's  generated ,COMMA obviously ,COMMA a  lot  of  economic  value .PERIOD it  's  also  inspired ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA a  lot  of  great  architecture  is .PERIOD there  's  a  point ,COMMA where  you  can  stand  here  and  see  buildings  by  frank  gehry ,COMMA jean  new  bell ,COMMA sugar  bond ,COMMA yields  and  ari .PERIOD and  the  whitney  is  moving  downtown  and  is  building  that  their  new  museum  right  at  the  base  of  the  high  line .PERIOD in  this  is  being  designed  by  renzo  piano .PERIOD and  they  're  going  to  break  ground  in  may .PERIOD and  we've  already  started  construction  on  section  two .PERIOD this  is  one  of  my  favorite  features ,COMMA this  flyover  where  year  eight  feet  off  the  surface  of  the  high  line ,COMMA running  through  a  canopy  of  trees .PERIOD the  high  line  used  to  be  covered  in  billboards ,COMMA and  so  we've  sort  of  taken  a  playful  take  where  instead  of  framing  advertising ,COMMA and  it  's  because  frame  people  and  views  of  the  city .PERIOD this  was  just  installed  last  month .PERIOD and  then  the  last  section  it  was  going  to  go  around  the  rail  yards ,COMMA which  is  the  largest  undeveloped  site  in  manhattan .PERIOD and  the  city  has  planned ,COMMA for  better  for  worse ,COMMA at  twelve  million  square  feet  of  development  the  line  is  going  to  ring  around .PERIOD but  you  know ,COMMA what  really ,COMMA i  think ,COMMA makes  the  high  line  special  is  the  people .PERIOD and  honestly ,COMMA even  though  i  love  the  designs  that  we  're  building ,COMMA i  was  always  frightened  that  i  would  n't  really  love  it ,COMMA because  i  fell  love  without  wild  escape ,COMMA and  how  could  you  re-create  that  magic ?QUESTIONMARK but  what  i  found  is  it  is  it  's  in  the  people  and  how  they  use  it  that ,COMMA to  me ,COMMA makes  it  so  special .PERIOD just  one  quick  example  is  i  realize  right  after  we  opened  that  they  're  all  these  people  holding  hands  on  the  high  line .PERIOD i  realized  new  yorkers  do  n't  hold  his  that .PERIOD we  just  do  n't  do  that  and  outside  fate .PERIOD well  you  see  that  happening  on  the  high  line ,COMMA and  i  think  that  's  you  know  the  power  that  the  public  space  can  have  to  transform  how  people  experience  the  city  and  interact  with  each  other .PERIOD thank  you  for .PERIOD a  few  years  ago ,COMMA i  felt  like  i  was  stuck  in  a  rut ,COMMA so  i  decided  to  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  the  great  american  philosopher ,COMMA morgan  spurlock ,COMMA and  try  something  new  for  thirty  days .PERIOD the  idea  is  actually  pretty  simple .PERIOD think  about  something  you've  always  wanted  to  add  to  your  life  and  try  it  for  the  next  thirty  days .PERIOD it  turns  out ,COMMA thirty  days  is  just  about  the  right  amount  of  time  to  have  new  habit  or  subtract  a  habit ,COMMA like  watching  the  news ,COMMA from  your  life .PERIOD there  's  a  few  things  that  i  learned  while  doing  these  thirty  day  challenges .PERIOD the  first  was ,COMMA instead  of  the  months  flying  by ,COMMA forgotten ,COMMA the  time  was  much  more  memorable .PERIOD this  was  part  of  a  challenge  i  did  to  take  a  picture  every  day  for  a  month .PERIOD and  i  remember  exactly  where  i  was  and  what  i  was  doing  that  day .PERIOD i  also  noticed  that  as  i  started  to  do  more  and  harder  thirty  day  challenges ,COMMA my  self-confidence  grew .PERIOD i  went  from  death  dwelling  computer  nerd  to  the  kind  of  guy  who  bikes  to  work ,COMMA for  fun .PERIOD even  last  year ,COMMA i  ended  up  hiking  up  mount  kilimanjaro ,COMMA the  highest  mountain  in  africa .PERIOD i  would  never  have  been  dead  adventurous  before  i  started  my  thirty  day  challenges .PERIOD i  also  figured  out  that  if  you  really  want  something  badly  enough ,COMMA you  can  do  anything  for  thirty  days .PERIOD if  you  're  wanted  write  a  novel ?QUESTIONMARK every  november ,COMMA tens  of  thousands  of  people  try  to  write  their  own  fifty  thousand  word  novel  from  scratch  in  thirty  days .PERIOD it  turns  out ,COMMA all  you  have  to  do  is  write  sixteen  hundred  and  sixty  seven  words  a  day  for  a  month .PERIOD so  i  did .PERIOD by  the  way ,COMMA the  secret  is  not  to  go  to  sleep  and  so  you've  written  your  words  for  the  day .PERIOD you  might  be  sleep-deprived ,COMMA but  you  'll  finish  a  novel .PERIOD now  is  my  book  the  next  great  american  novel ?QUESTIONMARK now  all  i  wrote  in  a  month .PERIOD it  's  cool .PERIOD but  for  the  rest  of  my  life ,COMMA if  i  meet  john  hodge  and  meditate  party ,COMMA i  do  n't  have  to  say ,COMMA i  'm  a  computer  scientist .PERIOD now ,COMMA now ,COMMA if  i  want  to  i  can  say ,COMMA i  'm  a  novelist .PERIOD so  here  's  one  last  thing  i'd  like  to  mention .PERIOD i  learned  that  when  i  made  small ,COMMA sustainable  changes ,COMMA things  i  could  keep  doing ,COMMA they  're  more  likely  to  stick .PERIOD there  's  nothing  wrong  with  big ,COMMA crazy  challenges .PERIOD in  fact ,COMMA there  a  ton  of  fun .PERIOD but  they  're  less  likely  to  stick .PERIOD when  i  gave  up  sugar  for  thirty  days ,COMMA day  thirty  one  looked  like  this .PERIOD so  here  's  my  question  to  you ,COMMA what  do  you  waiting  for ?QUESTIONMARK i  guarantee  you  the  next  thirty  days  are  going  to  pass  whether  you  like  it  or  not ,COMMA so  why  not  think  about  something  you've  always  wanted  to  try  and  give  it  a  shot  for  the  next  thirty  days .PERIOD thanks .PERIOD good  morning  everybody .PERIOD i  work  with  really  amazing  that  will  itty-bitty  creatures  called  cells .PERIOD and  let  me  tell  you  what  it  's  like  to  grow  these  cells  in  the  lab .PERIOD i  work  in  the  lab  where  we  take  cells  out  of  their  native  environment .PERIOD we  played  them  into  dishes  that  we  sometimes  call  petri  dishes .PERIOD and  we  feed  them ,COMMA stay  early  of  course ,COMMA with  what  we  call  cell  culture  media ,COMMA which  is  like  their  food  and  we  grow  them  in  incubators .PERIOD why  do  i  do  this ?QUESTIONMARK we  observe  the  cells  in  a  plate ,COMMA and  there  know  just  on  the  surface .PERIOD but  what  we  're  really  trying  to  do  in  my  lab  is  to  engineer  tissues  out  of  that .PERIOD what  does  that  even  mean ?QUESTIONMARK well  it  means  growing  in  actual  heart ,COMMA let  's  say ,COMMA or  grow  a  piece  of  bone  that  can  be  put  into  the  body .PERIOD not  only  that ,COMMA but  they  can  also  be  used  for  disease  models .PERIOD i  'm  going  to  purpose ,COMMA traditional  cell  culture  techniques  just  really  are  n't  enough .PERIOD the  cells  are  kind  of  homesick .PERIOD the  dish  does  n't  feel  like  their  home .PERIOD and  so  we  need  to  do  better  at  copying  their  natural  environment  to  get  them  to  thrive .PERIOD we  call  this  the  by  in  the  medical  paradigm ,COMMA copying  nature  in  the  lab .PERIOD let  's  take  the  example  of  the  heart ,COMMA the  topic  of  a  lot  of  my  research .PERIOD what  makes  the  heart  unique ?QUESTIONMARK well ,COMMA the  heart  beats  rhythmically ,COMMA tirelessly ,COMMA faithfully .PERIOD we  copy  this  in  the  land  by  outfitting  cell  culture  systems  with  electrodes .PERIOD these  electrodes  act  like  mini  pacemakers  to  get  the  cells  contract  in  the  lab .PERIOD what  else  do  we  know  about  the  heart ?QUESTIONMARK well  heart  cells  are  pretty  greedy .PERIOD nature  feeds  the  heart  cells  in  your  body  with  a  very ,COMMA very  dense  blood  supply .PERIOD in  the  lab ,COMMA we  might  for  patterns  channels  in  the  by  materials  on  which  we  grow  the  cells .PERIOD and  this  allows  us  to  flow  the  cell  culture  media ,COMMA the  cells  food ,COMMA through  the  scaffolds  were  growing  the  cells ,COMMA a  lot  like  what  you  might  expect  from  a  cap  larry  capillary  bed  in  the  heart .PERIOD so  this  brings  me  to  lesson  number  one ,COMMA life  can  do  a  lot  with  very  little .PERIOD let  's  take  the  example  of  electrical  stimulation .PERIOD let  's  see  how  powerful  just  one  of  these  essentials  can  be .PERIOD on  the  left ,COMMA we  see  a  tiny  piece  of  beating  heart  tissue  that  they  engineered  from  rat  cells  in  the  lab .PERIOD it  's  about  the  size  of  a  mini  marshmallow .PERIOD after  one  week ,COMMA it  's  beating .PERIOD you  can  see  it  up  in  the  upper  left-hand  corner .PERIOD the  door  if  you  can  see  it  so  well .PERIOD it  's  amazing  that  these  cells  beat  at  all .PERIOD but  what  's  really  amazing  is  that  the  cells ,COMMA when  we  electrically  stimulate  them  like  with  a  pacemaker ,COMMA that  they  be  so  much  more .PERIOD that  brings  me  to  lesson  number  jim ,COMMA cells  do  all  the  work .PERIOD in  a  sense ,COMMA tissue  engineers  have  a  bit  of  an  identity  crisis  here ,COMMA because ,COMMA you  know ,COMMA a  structural  engineers  build  bridges  and  big  things ,COMMA computer  engineers ,COMMA computers ,COMMA but  what  we  are  doing  is  actually  building  enabling  technologies  for  the  cells  themselves .PERIOD what  is  this  mean  for  us ?QUESTIONMARK let  's  do  something  really  simple .PERIOD let  's  remind  ourselves  that  cells  are  not  an  abstract  concept .PERIOD let  's  remember  that  our  cells  sustain  our  lives  in  a  very  real  way .PERIOD we  are  what  we  eat ,COMMA could  easily  be  described  as ,COMMA we  are  what  our  cells  eat .PERIOD and  in  the  case  of  the  flora  in  our  gut ,COMMA these  cells  may  not  even  be  human .PERIOD but  it  's  also  worth  noting  that  cells  also  mediate  our  experience  of  life .PERIOD behind  every  sound ,COMMA sight ,COMMA touch ,COMMA taste  and  smell  is  a  corresponding  set  of  cells  that  receive  this  information  and  interpret  it  for  us .PERIOD it  begs  the  question ,COMMA cell  we  expand  our  sense  of  environmental  stewardship  to  include  the  ecosystem  of  our  own  bodies ?QUESTIONMARK i  invite  you  to  talk  about  this  with  me  further ,COMMA and  in  the  meantime ,COMMA i  wish  you  luck .PERIOD may  none  of  your  in  on  cancer  cells  become  endangered  species .PERIOD thank  you .PERIOD
